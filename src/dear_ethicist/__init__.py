Dear Ethicist

An advice column game for measuring D4 gauge structure in moral reasoning,
based on the NA-SQND v4.1 framework.

You are a newly hired advice columnist. Letters arrive daily from readers
tangled in moral confusion. They want to know:

    Do I have to...?     (Obligation)
    Am I entitled to...? (Claim)
    Can I refuse...?     (Liberty)
    Can they demand...?  (Claim/No-claim)

These are Hohfeldian questions. They just don't know it.

Your job: Read their letters. Publish your responses. Build your readership.

The game never tells you what's "right." It shows what happens.
