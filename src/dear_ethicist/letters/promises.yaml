    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend Morgan promised to help me move apartments this Saturday. We agreed on this three weeks ago, and Morgan confirmed with "I'll be there at 8am!"

    The move is in two days. Do I have a right to expect Morgan to actually show up?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend Morgan promised to help me move apartments this Saturday. We agreed on this three weeks ago. But yesterday Morgan texted me saying "I'll help if it's convenient, no pressure!" with a smiley face.

    Now I don't know if I can count on Morgan or not. Do I have a right to expect Morgan to show up? Or did that text release Morgan from the promise?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend Morgan promised to help me move apartments this Saturday. Yesterday Morgan mentioned "I found a coworker who said they could help you too!"

    Does this mean Morgan is off the hook? Or does the original promise still stand?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend Morgan promised to help me move. Yesterday I texted Morgan: "Hey, I found professional movers. You're officially released from your promise! Enjoy your Saturday."

    Morgan seemed relieved. But now I'm second-guessing myself. Can I still expect Morgan to show up as a good friend, even though I released them?

    Dear Ethicist,

    I'm hosting a dinner party next weekend. My friend Sam said "I'll try my best to be there, but work has been crazy."

    Should I count Sam as attending? Do I have a right to be upset if they don't show?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend promised to help me paint my apartment. Later they said "Don't stress if you find someone else, I totally understand."

    Is that them backing out? Or just being considerate? I genuinely can't tell if I should still expect them.
