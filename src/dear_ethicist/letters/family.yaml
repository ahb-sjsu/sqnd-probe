    Dear Ethicist,

    My cousin is getting married across the country. We're not close - I see them maybe once every few years at family gatherings. The trip would cost me $1,500 and three days off work.

    My mom insists I "have to" go because "family is family." Do I actually have an obligation here? Does my cousin have any right to expect me there?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My mother expects me to come home for Thanksgiving, Christmas, AND Easter every year. I'm 34 and live four hours away. My partner's family never gets to see us.

    When I suggested alternating years, she said I was "abandoning the family." Am I obligated to prioritize her holidays? Does she have the right to demand this?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My father needs daily assistance now. I live closest, so I've been doing everything - doctor visits, groceries, medication management. My two siblings live further away and contribute nothing.

    They say since I'm "right there" it makes sense for me to handle it. But I'm exhausted. Do I have more obligation than them just because of geography? Do they have a right to opt out?

  questions:
    - Do I have more obligation because I live closer?
    - Do my siblings have a right to opt out?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My brother has asked to borrow $5,000. I've lent him money three times before and he's never paid any of it back. He says "family doesn't keep score."

    Am I obligated to help family when they ask? Does he have any right to expect this from me given his track record?
  parties:
    - name: You
      role: letter_writer

  subject: Parents changed their will
  voice: aggrieved
  body: |
    Dear Ethicist,

    My parents recently told me they're leaving everything to my sister because "she needs it more." I've worked hard and done well; she's made poor choices.

    I know it's their money, but I've been a dutiful child for 40 years. Do I have any claim here? Or do they have complete liberty to do what they want with their estate?
  parties:
    - name: You
      role: letter_writer
      is_writer: true
      expected_state: N
    - name: Parents
      role: parents
      expected_state: L
  questions:
    - Do I have any claim to the inheritance?
    - Do they have complete liberty to distribute as they wish?
