    Dear Ethicist,

    I borrowed my neighbor's lawn mower two months ago. I haven't returned it yet, and they haven't asked for it back.

    Two questions: Do I actually need to return it proactively? And does my neighbor have a right to demand it back even though they haven't said anything?

    Dear Ethicist,

    I promised to proofread my sister's thesis. She's now demanding I drop everything to do it this weekend because her deadline moved up.

    Who's right here? Do I actually owe her this on her timeline? Does she have a right to demand it immediately?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend told me I could use their car "whenever I need it." I've been using it most weekends. Now they seem annoyed.

    Am I free to keep using it as promised? Can they suddenly demand I stop when they said "whenever"?

    Dear Ethicist,

    I walked past a stranger struggling to carry groceries to their car. I didn't help because I was in a rush. Now I feel guilty.

    Did I actually have an obligation to help? Did they have any right to expect help from a random passerby?

    Dear Ethicist,

    I lent my friend $200 six months ago. They said they'd pay me back "soon" but haven't mentioned it since. I feel awkward bringing it up.

    Do they still owe me this money? Do I have the right to ask for it back, or would that be rude?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend told me a secret about their relationship troubles, explicitly asking me not to tell anyone. Now our mutual friends are asking me what's wrong with them.

    Am I obligated to keep this secret? Does my friend have the right to expect my silence even when directly asked?
