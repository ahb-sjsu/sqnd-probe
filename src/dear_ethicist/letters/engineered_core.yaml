    Dear Ethicist,

    My sister asked me to drive her to the airport at 5am. It's a 45-minute drive each way. I have work the next day and it would mean losing significant sleep.

    Dear Ethicist,

    My brother-in-law borrowed $5000 for his business three years ago, promising to repay when profitable. The business succeeded, but then my sister (his wife) divorced him. Now he's my EX-brother-in-law.
