    Dear Ethicist,

    My boss regularly expects me to stay late to finish projects, but I'm salaried so I don't get overtime pay. They say it's "part of the job" but it wasn't mentioned in my contract.

    Dear Ethicist,

    A former employee who was mediocre at best asked me to be a reference for a new job. I can't honestly say good things, but I don't want to sabotage their career either.

    Am I obligated to give the reference since they asked? Do they have a right to expect my help?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My coworker made a significant error on a project. They've asked me not to mention it in the team meeting and to help them fix it quietly. If it comes out, they could get fired.

    Do I have an obligation to cover for a colleague? Or do I owe honesty to my employer?

    Dear Ethicist,

    Last year my manager told me if I hit certain targets, I'd get promoted. I exceeded all of them. Now they say the budget doesn't allow for promotions this cycle.

    Did I have a valid claim to that promotion? Do they have the right to rescind what feels like a promise?
  parties:
    - name: You
      role: letter_writer

  questions:
    - Did I have a valid claim to that promotion?
    - Do they have the right to rescind the promise?

  subject: Should I report my company's violation?
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: |
    Dear Ethicist,

    I discovered my company is violating environmental regulations. Reporting it could cost people their jobs, including mine. Not reporting it means ongoing harm to the community.

    Do I have an obligation to report? Does the public have a claim on my honesty even if it costs me my livelihood?

      expected_state: C
  questions:
    - Do I have an obligation to report?
    - Does the public have a claim on my honesty?
