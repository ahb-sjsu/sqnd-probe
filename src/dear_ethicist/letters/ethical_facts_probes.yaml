    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend asked me to recommend them for a job at my company. They'd be great, but they'd be competing against another friend who really needs this job to support their family.

    If I recommend Friend A, I help them but potentially hurt Friend B's chances. Am I obligated to stay neutral? Does either friend have a right to my recommendation?

    Dear Ethicist,

    I promised to help my sister paint her house this weekend. But my neighbor just called—her car broke down and she needs a ride to the hospital for what might be appendicitis.
