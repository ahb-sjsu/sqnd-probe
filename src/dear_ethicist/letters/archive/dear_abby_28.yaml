    my parents are chronic overspenders. the illusion of material wealth is all they
    care about. over the past 10 years they have filed for bankruptcy twice, lost
    two homes, had three cars repossessed and been through credit counseling twice.
    my two siblings and i have tried to help, but all it did was enable them to continue
    acting irresponsibly. the money we have "lent" them is into five figures. once
    we lent them money so their car wouldn''t be repossessed, but they used it to
    buy new furniture. mom and dad are now unemployed, and none of us is able to bail
    them out again. last year, we asked them to forgo any holiday gifts. all we wanted
    was a family dinner and for them to use their money on bills and necessities.
    they didn''t listen and bought us extravagant gifts anyway, only to hit us up
    later for money to pay the bills! we returned the gifts and gave the money back
    to them. how do we impress upon our parents that we don''t want any gifts this
    year? we''re ready to cancel celebrating christmas with them. i know they''ll

    i am a 79-year-old recent widow. shortly after i was married i had a brief, intense
    affair with a man at work. i''ll call him "earl." earl''s wife, "lillian," was
    in her third trimester of pregnancy and he was needy. we fell hopelessly in love
    and our affair continued after his baby was born. we were happy together and nothing
    else seemed to matter. somehow lillian found out and left him. the divorce she
    said she''d seek would have solved our problems because i would have immediately
    divorced my husband, but it never happened. she still loved him, and he decided
    to do the "honorable thing" and reconcile with her. we swore we would love each
    other forever, no matter what. earl and lillian moved to a city 50 miles from
    here and we had no further contact. my husband forgave me, and we had a good life
    and three children. a friend kept me informed about earl -- where he was and what
    he was doing. she told me he has spent his life making up to lillian for his "indiscretion"
    and treating her like a queen. she is now in a nursing home suffering with alzheimer''s.
    she no longer knows earl, but he goes to see her every day. would it be wrong
    of me to get in touch with him to sympathize? i still love him. perhaps he loves

    may i respond to your column regarding excessive waits in doctors'' offices (sept.
    1)? i am a board-certified interventional cardiologist who has been practicing
    for 30 years. i work 85 to 90 hours each week. as hard as we try, our office schedule
    often falls behind. despite recommendations that acute problems go to the emergency
    room, unscheduled patients come to the office with chest pains, and they must
    be attended to. even scheduled patients can develop complex medical issues that
    require extra, unplanned time to evaluate and treat. our patients with a history
    of heart disease do not mind waiting when the office runs behind because they
    receive the same specialized extra-care treatment when they need it. delays that
    result from spending extra time evaluating and treating sick patients with complicated
    problems is not "unprofessional" behavior as "larry w." implied. on the contrary,
    it relates to the art of medicine and caring for the well-being of each patient
    above all else. and for the architect, i wonder when he last worked a 90-hour
    week, took seven or eight phone calls from his clients after midnight, and got
    up at 3 a.m. to do an emergency two-hour procedure before returning to his office

    i have just learned that my husband of 28 years has end-stage leukemia. i worked
    in the medical field for years and have been around a lot of sick people, but
    this is "unreal" for me. i''m in a state of shock, and terrified about what lies
    ahead. i have told all our children except our daughter, "pearl." pearl is pregnant
    and has miscarried three times. she knows her father hasn''t been well, but she
    doesn''t know the current facts. when her father first became ill, pearl told
    me that if i ever withheld any critical information about it from her she would
    never forgive me. she lives in another state, far from us. i am worried if i tell
    her about her dad''s condition she''ll have complications with her pregnancy.
    but if i don''t and her dad worsens, pearl might not get to see him in time. am
    i wrong to keep this from her? should i tell her? i don''t want to increase her

    my wife and i were visiting our children and grandson, "rhett," age 24. rhett
    is a college student who lives at home. he had his girlfriend, "peggy," who lives
    in another town, at the house for the weekend. rhett and peggy retired to his
    room early in the evening. when we saw them at breakfast, they were, basically,
    uncommunicative. shortly after, they went to the backyard and immediately climbed
    into the hammock, where they lay like tightly wound dishrags for the next two
    hours until it was time for us to leave. our son and his wife did not awaken them
    to say goodbye, so we concluded that they had been exhausted by the previous night''s

    sits around watching tv and wants me to sit with her. i love spending time with

    her own house, pets and husband, and it would be fine if she didn''t visit every

    as a fire officer, i have seen far too many families fall victim to accidental
    home fires. it is devastating to find out that a life could have been saved if
    someone had only taken that simple step of replacing a dead battery in a smoke
    alarm. nearly 96 percent of american homes have at least one smoke alarm. but
    did you know that 19 percent of american homes lack a working smoke alarm because
    the batteries are missing or dead? for 22 years, the international association
    of fire chiefs and energizer have been committed to changing this statistic through
    the "change your clock change your battery" campaign. this partnership encourages
    families to change the battery in their smoke alarms when they set their clocks
    back an hour on nov. 1. this message also serves as a reminder to communities
    nationwide to change the batteries in their carbon monoxide detectors. as winter
    approaches, more people will begin using gas appliances to heat their homes and
    may find themselves at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, called the "silent killer"
    because this gas is colorless, odorless and tasteless. thank you, abby, for helping

    i am 13, 5 feet 3, and weigh 90 pounds. i just started high school. my parents
    think i''m starving myself. they call me "disgusting," "horrifying," and my personal
    favorite -- "ugly." my brother calls me "skinny bones jones." i do not starve
    myself, nor am i anorexic or bulimic. i just happen to get full from small portions
    rather quickly -- or i may not be hungry at the moment. at night i do some quick
    exercises and yoga positions so i won''t feel bloated from meals. some of my friends
    have said they think i have become anorexic. because of all this my self-esteem
    is at an all-time low. i used to weigh more than 100 pounds, but recently i got
    the stomach flu, which explains my sudden weight loss and fullness. am i wrong
    in thinking i''m healthy? are my family and friends right that i''m anorexic?
    please help. -- 90-pound girl in fullerton, calif.'

    the small neighborhoods trick-or-treating with my little ones, i see the high
    school kids in their costumes as well. they are well-behaved and having a good

    my husband, "harvey," and i have operated a home-based business for more than
    20 years. harvey is an amazing technician, extremely efficient with his time on
    the job. the problem is, he is always in a hurry to get to the next job. i receive
    calls from angry motorists complaining that "the driver of one of our trucks"
    cut them off, yelled at them or flipped them off in traffic. when i receive one
    of these calls i say, "thank you for calling. i''ll be sure to speak to the appropriate
    driver about the incident." harvey feels i should support him by telling the caller
    it was probably his own fault for talking on a cell phone, driving too slow or
    cutting him off. i have no doubt that some of these motorists actually do those
    things, but my husband is driving around with his phone number on his truck and
    they''re not. when i mention the complaints, he wants to call them back using
    caller id. am i handling this appropriately? i don''t feel i should reprimand
    someone for bad driving if i wasn''t present when something happened, nor do i
    want anyone to know it was my husband -- the owner of the business -- who flipped
    them off. harvey is angry at me because i''m "not supporting" him. any suggestions?

    i was raised from an early age that if you play a game, you have to play fair

    while i realize it''s possible for people to play the same game slightly differently,
    the rules still applied. what i don''t understand is cheating. a couple i know

    i work in a call center with 35 other workers. recently our supervisor hired a

    the most part, she appears to be capable. the problem is she hears "voices" speaking
    to her and often responds to them. other times she "hears" co-workers seated behind
    her plotting to kill her, which, of course, is not true. she disrupts those around
    her by constantly asking if they can hear what others are saying about her and
    what she should do about it. we have spoken to our supervisor about our concerns.
    his answer is, "just be quiet and it will be ok." we don''t dislike her -- in

    my best friend "jenny''s" husband died four years ago. they had been married 28

    man she knew through her former job. (i''ll call him "george.") they were casual
    acquaintances, but when george learned she was a widow he immediately asked for
    her phone number. he called the next day, they talked, he visited her at her home,
    and they had unprotected sex. they now see each other once or twice a week and
    have sex. that''s all they do. jenny says she''s in love with him. she talks about
    him constantly and says she''s very happy. my husband and i were at a club the
    other night and saw george in the company of another woman. i haven''t told jenny
    because she doesn''t want to be told if her man is cheating on her. she says that

    sex with her, it''s probably the same with the other woman. george appears to

    my heart is broken. my 18-year-old son, "joey," has just put his name on someone
    else''s child''s birth certificate. he met the girl in high school. she was already
    pregnant. joey has been out of school since may. he has no job, no money and no
    car. joey promised her family he will "take care of her." they were only too happy
    to hear it because the real father wants nothing to do with her or the baby. her
    parents have made my son feel like a hero, and he enjoys it. i did everything
    in my power to talk him out of it. nothing worked. i can''t believe that the girl''s
    family is encouraging him. joey is not a man, even if he is 18. where are their

    i married a caring, thoughtful man who is also a loving father. my problem is
    my father-in-law, who constantly "reminds" me that i''m the best thing that ever
    happened to his son and that there is no way my husband would be successful if
    it weren''t for my influence in his life. while i''m happy to have my father-in-law''s
    approval, it makes me uncomfortable, and it''s hurtful to my husband. my husband
    was not a wild child in his youth, so i don''t know why dad feels my husband would
    be a failure if not for me. my husband is a wonderful man on his own merits, not
    mine, and the implication is insulting. how can i help my father-in-law see this?

    it sounds to me that "pillow talk" and his wife have too much time on their hands.
    if all they have to do is debate which way to turn the pillows when they make
    the bed, how do they feel about the epidemic of belly-button lint? what difference
    does it make which way the pillow edges are turned? they''re usually hidden by

    i know it''s early, but my problem is thanksgiving. for the past several years
    we have included four other families for thanksgiving dinner in our home. their
    children are married now, and including their spouses and stepchildren, the number
    of guests is now close to 30. i feel it is too many and would like to downsize.
    one family is my son''s in-laws, whom i consider to be family. another family
    hosts everyone for easter, and i would still like to include them because we''re
    close and we spend holidays with them. the other two families are not as close
    with us anymore. we have never been invited to celebrate a holiday in their homes.
    they could cook for their families, and i feel like i am being used. i would like
    to tell them, after thanksgiving is over this year, that we plan to have a smaller
    gathering next year. that will allow them ample time to make other plans. my husband
    agrees. how do i do this without causing a rift, since two families will be included

    when he was single. i do call, but now i limit it to once every few weeks, although
    he rarely answers his phone. i wanted to let him call at his convenience. he has
    told me that e-mail is the best way to reach him. the problem is, he doesn''t
    respond to my e-mails, doesn''t answer my calls and rarely phones me to see how
    our family is doing. i was recently ill and jeremy didn''t even call to see how
    i was. i''m hurt, and part of me wants to tell him so. i''m afraid if i do i''ll

    our son, "philip," has been married for two years. he recently informed his wife,
    "karla," that one of his co-workers -- i''ll call her sarah -- is pregnant with
    his child. philip says he still loves karla and wants to stay together, but he
    feels an obligation to the other child. karla is now pregnant with their first
    baby. the problem is, philip is spending most of his time at sarah''s home caring
    for her, and very little time with his wife. my wife and i don''t know how we
    should handle the relationship with the two grandchildren. what are our obligations
    to each? should we treat them both the same? by the way, my wife and i have never

    "robert" and i have been married for 10 years. a few months ago i discovered that
    he''d had an affair. he says it was because he felt i didn''t love him anymore
    and we weren''t communicating. i have never stopped loving him. the funny thing
    is, i felt the same way he did -- upset that he was spending more time away from
    home. we''re now trying to work things out, but it''s hard for me. i keep learning
    more information about their relationship, and it breaks my heart all over again.
    i know who she is and what she looks like. i''ll be seeing this woman at a bridal
    shower soon, and later on this fall at a wedding. robert says she doesn''t know
    what i look like. i am tempted to pretend to be someone else and quiz her about
    their relationship. i''m just so lost. i want to let all of this go and move on,

    anymore and he''s not willing to fix it. i feel like a roommate instead of a wife.

    our daughter, "daisy," had some really bad relationships in the past and held
    on to them far too long. at 33, she finally met a man, "melvin," who was good
    to her and fun to be with. we were relieved that she had finally made a right
    choice. melvin was divorced with a son. he told daisy he was a police officer
    who retired early because of the stress, and regaled her with stories about the
    many outrageous incidents he''s been involved in. they married and now have a
    new baby. daisy is happy, loves being a wife and mother, and we were pleased that
    she has what she always wanted. my husband and i became suspicious about some
    of melvin''s stories about the wild and crazy situations that had happened to
    him on a daily basis. in them, he was always defending helpless people against
    brutal attackers, saving people in imminent danger, and he was always the hero.
    my husband decided to check out melvin''s claim of having been a cop. we were
    shocked and sickened to learn that he never was. all of his stories are lies.

    my toddler and i were rear-ended a few days ago. thankfully, neither of us was
    hurt. the other driver''s insurance is paying for the car repairs. they will also
    reimburse me for a new car seat if i buy one and submit the receipt. my husband,
    the sole wage earner in our family, insists that we don''t need to replace the
    car seat. money is tight, but i think we could come up with it, and besides, we''d
    be reimbursed. he also thinks the accident was so minor that the seat should protect
    our child in another collision, and i''m "just a gullible consumer buying into
    marketing propaganda." (for the record, he''s a loving husband and father, just
    tight with money.) should i replace the car seat knowing it will upset him, or
    should i continue feeling guilty about placing our child in a possibly compromised
    car seat? -- safety-first mom in tennessee'

    i have been living with a very nice man for 28 years, and at one point we were

    at what point does a parent stop giving unsolicited advice? it is painful to watch

    "alicia," is 43. when she inherited a considerable estate, i told her the windfall
    could make her quite comfortable in her old age. she agreed. after a year and
    a half i doubt she has much of her inheritance left. now that yet another live-in
    relationship has ended, i suggested that next time she find a man who is self-supporting.

    and she''d keep the cat at her home. shortly after, loretta asked my husband to
    secretly get rid of it. (her husband had refused.) when my husband said he couldn''t
    do it, she took matters into her own hands, drove precious 10 miles away from

    he left school shortly afterward without saying goodbye. later i was given some
    shocking news. his roommate told me that will was gay. i went through the gamut
    of emotions from disbelief to anger to sadness. and i felt used. twenty-six years
    have passed. i answered the phone at work two days ago and was surprised to hear
    will''s voice on the other end. he was shocked, too. i asked if he remembered
    me and he said he did. he came into the store several days later, and we exchanged
    phone numbers and e-mail addresses. i looked at his web pages and saw pictures

    them six hours a day while she works. i was fine with this arrangement until recently,
    when she began relying on me completely for baby-sitting. now she expects me to
    watch them every time she goes shopping or out with her current boyfriend. she
    has begun spending the night at his house and not calling to let me know i need
    to take care of the kids when they wake up. i know something needs to change.
    am i being selfish, or should i confront her? please help me. -- teen sitter in

    i have been married to a wonderful man for 28 years. my problem is his mother,

    small town, but to a home just up the street! my husband works long hours, and
    his mother expects him to visit her daily. if he gets a day off and we do something

    i am a 46-year-old woman, and i feel as though my life is over. i lost my job
    more than a year ago and haven''t been able to find another one. i have no friends,
    and it has been 13 years since i dated. i live day to day, only for my mom and
    my dog -- both of whom i love tremendously. i''m glad i can spend so much time
    with them each day, but i know i''m missing out on something more in my life.
    i am well-educated, well-read and have traveled quite a bit, when my financial
    situation was better. abby, i feel like i''m 96, not 46! i am depressed and disheartened
    and don''t know what to do. i can''t afford counseling. i have thought about volunteering,
    but i don''t want to work with kids and most volunteer jobs require that. please,
    can you suggest anything to help me out of this slump? i figure i have a good

    my boyfriend, "cooper," and i started dating last fall. his parents and i get
    along well, but there is one person in his life who doesn''t want us to be together.
    that would be "claire," a close family friend who is also known as cooper''s "second
    mom." cooper dated claire''s daughter for a few months a couple of years ago.
    cooper is polite, smart and good looking. it''s no wonder that claire would rather
    he date her daughter. there have been many times that claire has been rude to
    me, including saying to my face that she wishes cooper would break up with me
    and start dating her daughter again. i have spoken to cooper about it. apparently,

    my daughter, "amelia," recently joined the ranks of a "direct sales force." she
    has asked me to make arrangements so she can present her products to my circle
    of friends. i love amelia beyond words and would do anything to support her, but
    i told her that in this instance i felt i would be betraying my friends by "using"
    their friendship. in my opinion, hosting a "party" for the purpose of selling
    makes the invitees feel obligated to buy something whether they need it or not.
    i told amelia i don''t want to put my friends in that position. my daughter took
    immediate offense and told me i was way off-base because attendees are "free to
    purchase products -- or not -- as they choose." in other words, i''m the one with
    the hang-up and it isn''t necessarily shared by others. it upsets me terribly
    that my daughter is now angry and thinks i have abandoned her because i''m uncomfortable

    forty years ago, after accusing our father of taking indecent liberties with her,
    my sister "vera" was diagnosed with a major mental illness. she was 17. after
    many difficult years of hospitalizations, medication and electro-shock therapy,
    vera finally accepted her diagnosis and now lives in a board-and-care home nearby.
    she has never been well enough to work or carry on a relationship, and due to
    her medication, she suffers from a serious neuromuscular disorder. our father
    died suddenly -- and while going through his belongings, mom and i discovered
    some graphic polaroid photos that prove vera''s allegations were true. mom destroyed

    delusional, that she was misdiagnosed and treated unnecessarily. mom is adamantly
    opposed. she says vera is receiving the "best help available" and it would only
    "upset her" if she knew what we found. i am heartsick. should i tell vera at the

    my children are grown and gone. the youngest left more than four years ago. for
    the last several years i have asked them to remove their stored items from my
    house, which is still crammed with their stuff i''m not supposed to move. i have
    finally scheduled a dumpster for a two-week period convenient for me and let everyone
    know they need to "claim it or lose it." one daughter, "lynette," has decided
    that because i won''t change the dates to suit her schedule -- of which she isn''t
    even sure -- she will consider me "dead" to her. obviously this has hurt me deeply.
    i realize that lynette thinks the world revolves around her, but don''t i have
    the right to clean out my home at my convenience? do i owe her more notice, even
    though most of the items have been here eight to 10 years? i thought being assertive
    prevented people from walking all over you. it pains me that my daughter will
    no longer speak to me. she has also taken steps to keep other family members away
    as well. her older sister says she is overreacting and will come to her senses,
    but i''m not sure. i''m divorced from her father, so there is little support there.

    my grandfather left me money from his life insurance policy, but left none to
    my sister. the money could help me get our family out of debt, purchase a house
    and pay for my son''s education. my sister has repeatedly made poor choices and
    expected others to clean up after her. word got out that i received the inheritance,
    and i was told i should give her some. i know in the back of my mind that she''ll
    do something stupid with it. grandpa left me the money -- not my sister. why do

    my daughter, "laurie," is being married soon. her fiance, "peter," is a likable
    young man. he is, however, a sports fanatic who stays glued to the television
    whenever a game is playing. laurie is aware of his passion, and because she loves
    peter, she doesn''t have a problem with it. they have both now stated that if
    their team is in the playoffs or the world series, they want tvs brought in for
    the guests at the wedding reception. i am opposed to the idea. this will be a
    formal wedding and reception at an expensive hotel, and we are paying for it.
    i think peter and laurie should regard the day they take their vows as a once-in-a-lifetime
    event and forgo the game. guests who feel compelled to check the score may do
    so in the bar or in their rooms. at the risk of being rude, i don''t want to encourage
    the sports zeal by bringing in television sets. am i hopelessly out of touch and
    old-fashioned? please help. this may escalate to a confrontation before the wedding.

    my mother-in-law is a hoarder, and anything her son (my husband) and i do to bring
    it to her attention makes her angry. when we had a meeting with her and her doctor
    about the situation, she denied that she had a problem. she straight-out lied
    to him and said she''s "working on the issue." in reality she has done nothing.
    it has reached the point that my mother-in-law is sleeping on a corner of her
    couch because the clutter has forced her out of her bedroom. is there any organization
    out there that we can contact for support and guidance on how to address this?

    two years ago my younger sister, "cilla," generously set up college funds for
    my three children. each of the accounts has more than $25,000. my husband and
    i were stunned, but cilla insisted she is making good money in the film industry
    and wanted to do this for my family. three months ago, she came to visit, and
    through a bizarre turn of events, i discovered that she makes her living starring
    in adult films. now that i know how cilla earns her living, i am no longer comfortable
    accepting her gifts -- especially the college funds for the children. this has
    caused problems between my husband and me. he thinks we should keep the money
    because we may not be able to afford three college tuitions on our own. abby,

    my letter to you is the first time i have shared my problem with anyone. when
    i met and married my husband of 30 years, we each had been divorced for more than
    10 years. he had adult children with families of their own; i had none. for several
    years i acknowledged their special occasions with cards and small gifts, never
    receiving any notice or thank you unless i had my husband ask if they had been
    received. i finally stopped. although they always celebrate their father''s special
    days, i have yet to be remembered on mine. they send any special news or pictures
    addressed only to my husband. i recognize i cannot change the situation, but my
    question is how do i manage my growing resentment toward not only his family but
    my husband as well? as you can guess, we are elderly. i don''t want to spend my

    up and confronted him, the first thing out of his mouth was her name. they have
    an 18-year-old daughter and have been divorced for 13 years. to top it off, she''s
    married and pregnant. ralph swears he doesn''t know why he was texting her, that
    he doesn''t love her and that the e-mails were about a job. abby, i thought we
    had a happy marriage. i''m crushed, and my whole world is falling apart. my husband

    i am a non-drinker. i don''t like the taste of alcohol, and i prefer to remain
    sober. why is such a big deal made about alcohol and who''s drinking? i attended
    a friend''s birthday luncheon, and she apologized to the group for not drinking,
    saying she''d had enough partying the night before. another time i went to a bar
    with a boyfriend to see a band perform. his friends -- all of them "buzzed," by
    the way -- asked me repeatedly why i wasn''t drinking. this isn''t the only time

    my husband and i have decided to take our son out of the day care where he has
    been for the past six months. it''s a small center, run by a woman, "joni," who
    serves as director and lead teacher. she started the service two years ago and
    manages a staff of about 12. joni is the reason we are leaving. she seems incredibly
    stressed out all the time. she is curt with us when we talk and has been too harried
    to discuss our concerns over our boy''s care. she appears to be more preoccupied
    with finances than the quality of care she is providing. one of our favorite teachers
    just quit, and she confided that it was because of the difficulty she had working
    with joni. because we told joni we are going, she has requested an "exit interview"
    to discuss what didn''t work for us. i am hesitant about it. if we let her know
    the impact her stress is having on the quality of service she provides, she might
    be able to hire an administrator and make improvements. on the other hand, she
    may take offense. our community is small, so we will see her around, and because
    there are few child care centers, we may need to go back to this one someday.

    my husband and i have always been active. we''re avid campers and certified scuba
    divers; we water-ski and enjoy taking leisurely rides along country roads on our
    motorcycle. i recently had an accident and had to have an x-ray of my spine. afterward,
    my doctor informed me that the vertebrae in my neck are positioned in such a way
    that if i''m ever in another accident, i would probably become a paraplegic. my
    husband now wants to sell our motorcycle and do everything possible to "protect"

    i live in a small town in alaska. a relationship with a woman i loved more than
    i have ever loved anyone has ended. i''m left with only pain, misery and suffering.
    i keep trying to move on, but everything i do makes me think of her. i have asked
    friends for advice; they all tell me to "man up and get over it!" it''s frustrating
    to be told to "get over her" and accept what is. i know brooding isn''t helpful,

    my boyfriend, "kent," and i have been together almost three years. it started
    out as a long-distance relationship, but my children and i have recently moved
    to his town. when we were long-distance, we''d talk several times a day and say
    how much we loved each other. now we don''t talk that often except when we fight
    over stupid things, and the "i love you''s" are almost nonexistent. i say it to
    kent all the time. during a couple of our fights he actually told me he doesn''t
    love me, and his actions sometimes show me he means it. when i try to discuss
    it, he says he was just mad and that he really does love me. abby, what bothers
    me is when we have "alone time" -- the kids are asleep or away -- kent would rather
    watch sports, play on the computer, go out to the movies with his best friend

    break up every year. then kate flies back to visit the family. everyone tells
    her not to reconcile with leslie and to start a life without her. after a few
    weeks, kate goes back, gets back together with leslie, and the cycle starts all

    insane. we live in the same town. if i go over to visit, she expects me to call

    in december, right before christmas, my daughter and i went shopping. we visited
    several stores in a strip mall in the small town where we live. after returning
    to my vehicle, i left the wheelchair i use for long distances at the back for
    my daughter to load. we were getting ready to leave town. i hurried home, wrapped
    the gifts i had bought, then rushed out again to deliver them in the next town.
    when we reached our next stop, i realized i had left my wallet in the pocket of
    my wheelchair. when i asked my daughter to retrieve it, she looked at me and said,
    "you took the wheelchair out?" that was when we realized she had forgotten to
    load it. i started calling the stores to ask if anyone had turned in a wallet
    and wheelchair. the answer was no. when i decided to call the sheriff''s department
    and ask if anyone had turned the items in, the dispatcher began asking me all
    kinds of questions about my whereabouts and safety. abby, they thought i had been
    kidnapped! i felt terrible for upsetting everyone. i would like to thank the good
    samaritan who turned in my wheelchair and my wallet, intact, with nothing missing.

    my boyfriend, "beau," and i moved in together and already we have trust issues.
    he doesn''t trust me around his computer. he said he has things on it that are
    part of his past, and it''s none of my business. one of the things he doesn''t
    want me to see is "the list." he keeps a list of all the girls he has slept with
    -- including one-night stands. i have asked beau how many there have been, but
    he doesn''t want to tell me "because it will hurt me." he has revealed that it''s
    a number between 10 and 50. i have asked him to delete the list, but he said that

    my older sister, "carole," has been dealing with breast cancer for almost a year.
    although my family and i live three hours away and are struggling with problems
    of our own, we have always been supportive of her. last week, carole called to
    tell me she''ll be going to australia at the end of the year -- a "reward" from
    her husband for everything she has been through. i was happy for her until she
    informed me that i would be taking care of her kids for two weeks while she''s
    on vacation. i joked, "it doesn''t sound like you''re giving me any choice in
    this." she replied: "no, i''m not. i went through cancer. i deserve this trip."
    i reminded carole that when i watched her kids just two months ago, things didn''t
    go well. they are completely different from my children, and they don''t like
    each other. her 5-year-old daughter cried all night, every night while she was
    here. her son destroys everything he comes into contact with -- we still have
    a hole in the bedroom wall -- and has a vocabulary i don''t want my kids exposed
    to. do i have a right to just say "no" and offer my best wishes in finding a sitter?
    i feel guilty, but i don''t feel she''s entitled to demand this from me. am i

    i have been dating "ted," a widower, for two years. ted has two daughters in their
    20s. one is a college student; the other is a professional woman. both girls still
    live at home. the problem in our relationship is that ted allows them to dictate
    what he can and cannot do. i have been patient and understanding about the situation.
    ted''s wife died three years ago, at age 50. the family was close. i feel ted
    is leading two lives -- one i am not a part of, which includes his friends, and
    our life, which includes my friends and family. ted comes to my place and gets
    along with my 20-something sons with ease, but when i suggest going to his house,
    he refuses. he says his girls want nothing to do with me and tell him i''m not
    welcome. his daughters have attempted more than once to sabotage our relationship,
    but i continue to be patient. ted has said the girls need counseling, but they
    refuse. i suggested he go and then they could join him. abby, how can a parent

    my son was required to read "romeo and juliet" in his freshman year of high school.
    it has always bothered me that this play is considered good for teenagers to read,
    much less required reading. the story ends with romeo and juliet committing suicide,
    which is considered "romantic." teen suicide is on the rise. i feel we don''t

    full custody and receives child support every month from her ex-husband. the problem
    is, she has been spending the money that''s intended for the children on her boyfriends.
    because of it, they have been homeless twice, and it may happen again. the only
    person in that household with a steady job is the oldest -- a boy -- but he can''t
    support all of them by himself. how can i make my sister see how irresponsible
    and immature she is? my nephew would like to move out, but he is afraid it would
    seem like he is abandoning his family. please help me. -- alarmed auntie in d.c.'

    i am embarrassing my 7-year-old son. i make him come into the women''s restroom
    with me if no family bathroom is available. he can use the bathroom by himself,
    of course, but i worry about who might be lurking in the men''s room while he
    is out of my sight. other mothers say they agree that a "bad man" could be loitering

    i am a 43-year-old professional woman with a good job. i was recently invited
    by a friend to join her and her parents on a four-day mini-vacation trip. i accepted
    with the understanding that i would share food and hotel expenses. her father
    insisted on paying for every meal and excursion, and refused my offers to pay
    for anything. this made me very uncomfortable, since i was not expecting a free

    i am 43, the mother of four children and just celebrated my 20th anniversary.
    is it normal for someone to be married all this time and still not want your husband
    to see you naked? i do not reveal myself to him. the lights must always be off,
    and i keep a shirt on. it''s not because i am ashamed of my body; it''s that i''m
    not attracted to him. i never was. i married my husband for security and have
    learned to love him. but i love him like a brother, in a sisterly kind of way.
    i feel i owe him. should i tell my husband how i feel and risk losing my security
    after all this time? i had to talk to someone, so i confided in my best friend.
    she advised me to say nothing. my husband had an affair a few years ago, and frankly,
    i was secretly relieved. sometimes i wish he was still with her. now that it''s
    over, i''m back in hiding. abby, please advise. -- hiding in pennsylvania'

    i am 45 and currently going through a divorce. my soon-to-be ex-wife and i have
    a 14-year-old daughter, "gina," and i have custody. fourteen years ago, when my
    wife became pregnant with gina, we had talked about abortion. we even had an appointment
    scheduled, but on the day of the appointment we decided not to go through with
    it. i thank god that we did have our child. gina knows nothing about any of this,
    but my future ex has threatened to tell her. my daughter is mature for her age
    and intelligent, but i feel the time is not right for her to know. given the situation,
    i feel she should hear it from me because of the close relationship we have. do
    you agree that the news should wait until the divorce is final and the dust settles,
    or should i tell her now? -- daddy who cares'

    i am in a bit of a muddle. i have had a platonic friendship with "greg" for four
    years. he is married, and i have a longtime boyfriend, "randall." about a year
    ago, greg and i crossed the line into a romantic relationship. i guess you could
    call it an affair. greg was unhappy with his marriage, and i was unsettled in
    my relationship. the affair ended six months ago, along with greg and my friendship.
    i felt so bad about the whole thing that i confessed and apologized to randall,
    who (surprisingly) is still with me. he says he loves me. i realized that randall
    is very dear to me, and i have no intention of ever repeating this kind of episode
    again. as for greg, i accept that our romantic relationship is over. but i feel
    sad that our friendship is over, too. he never told me i can''t approach him or
    speak to him again. i don''t know how to get our friendship back, if i even can.
    can you provide any suggestions? -- muddled in virginia'

    i have been dating "mary" for 18 months, and i was really starting to fall for
    her. things were going well until three weeks ago, when she informed me that she
    has a serious gambling problem. she has maxed out her credit cards and has no
    money left in her savings. until this point, mary had given me the impression
    that she was someone i could trust and that she was in control of her life. i
    am in total shock and very upset about the fact that she has misrepresented herself
    to me. she said she didn''t want to lose me. she says that even though we''re
    not married, every relationship has its ups and downs, and a piece of paper should
    not define commitment. some of my friends say i should never see her again as
    she is manipulative. others say continuing the relationship depends on how i feel
    about her. while i can forgive her, i am having a problem with the issue of trust.

    when my husband and i moved into our new home, one of the neighbor kids, "rachael"
    (age 9), took a liking to me. she came over with her mom, introduced herself and
    asked for my phone number. i thought nothing of it. but as time has passed, she
    has been calling more and more to invite me over. abby, i''m almost 30! it has
    reached the point where we no longer answer our phone. rachael also shows up at
    our door with her friends and wants to "hang out." sometimes she just stands there
    and doesn''t say anything. it''s awkward because i have never been wild about
    kids. the girl is also constantly in our yard, playing with our dog (even though
    she has pets of her own), using our outdoor furniture, etc. i thought her mom
    would discourage it -- but one day she actually left rachael with me when she
    went out on a saturday night. rachael has a response to all my excuses about why
    i can''t see her. when i get home from work, she and several other young kids
    are playing in my driveway as i pull in. i have told her no one is allowed in

    i met "greta" when i was in the army reserves. we fell in love, despite the fact
    that her parents disapproved of me. i come from a working-class background and
    greta''s family was considerably more well-off. we didn''t care -- we wanted a
    future together. greta told me she had broken up with her former boyfriend because
    he was domineering. she assured me the relationship was over, and i believed her.
    shortly before i was discharged, greta told me she was carrying my baby. i left
    for home with plans to send for her and marry her before our child was born. i
    lined up a job and a place to live. several months later, greta phoned to say
    she had had a baby girl. she said her parents had made her give our daughter up
    for adoption and asked me never to contact her again. i honored her wishes, but
    i worried for years about greta and our child. eventually i married and had two
    daughters and a son. five years ago, with the help of my children who are technologically
    savvy, we located my lost daughter, "lily," and welcomed her into the family.
    to cement our relationship, i had a paternity test performed recently and was
    shocked to learn i am not lily''s father. greta still insists that i am, but dna
    doesn''t lie. greta put my name on lily''s birth certificate. lily blames herself
    for this mess, which is unfounded, and now says it''s too painful to see me and
    my family again. i am so sorry for lily and her children, who thought they were

    (45 minutes or more) and was taken to the emergency room by ambulance. she also
    has "minor" seizures that last only 30 to 60 seconds. i have seen them. her doctor
    has told her not to drive and that it''s against the law in our state for her
    to drive until she has been seizure-free for six months. the problem is, mom and
    her husband believe she can drive safely. she even bought a new car so she can
    get "better gas mileage." i have offered to take mom to doctors and other appointments,
    etc. she allows me to, but still drives herself to the grocery store and hairdresser
    and other places because they are "close by." (not!) abby, i lost a brother in
    a car accident. i don''t want to lose my mother in one, too. i''m also afraid
    for the safety of pedestrians and other drivers in her path. what can i do or
    say to get mom to follow the doctor''s orders? -- worried in the west'

    i am a man who, for 46 years, has been celebrating my birthday on aug. 31. i recently
    took a trip to northern california to visit my older sister. while we were talking
    about our birthdays and our late parents, my sister dropped a bombshell. she informed
    me that my birthday was not aug. 31, but actually sept. 1 -- like hers. as you
    can imagine, i was shocked. why would my own mother lie to me about something
    as important as my own date of birth? mom even went so far as to have the doctor
    change the date on my birth certificate! my two older brothers confirmed it. i
    am devastated at the dishonesty. why would a mother do such a thing? celebrating
    my birthday will never be the same again. -- searching for answers in syracuse'

    may i chime in on the letter from "mini-me in texas" (feb. 5), who didn''t want
    to disclose to her colleagues the fact that she''d had weight-reduction surgery?
    there is still enormous bias against overweight people, even from those who should
    know better. the perception is that the problem is a "lack of control." there
    is also prejudice from these same folks against individuals who seek the lap band
    procedure because it is regarded as "taking the easy way out." i understand why
    "mini" would prefer to keep her procedure and adjustments private. one''s own
    body and eating habits are a private matter. if "mini" wants to deflect negative
    speculation, she can say that she is worried about her health, has sought medical
    advice and is following her doctor''s plan to help her lose weight. kudos to "mini"
    for improving her health. weight loss is always a struggle, and well-meaning people
    should not pass judgment or interfere. -- mini-me supporter in oakland'

    one of my co-workers has been conducting long phone calls with her newly married
    daughter, who seems to be having marital troubles. the conversations are interesting
    and quite personal. sometimes i feel awkward hearing all the uncomfortable details,
    but the calls are impossible to ignore in our quiet little office. how do i tactfully
    let the offender know she''s broadcasting her daughter''s private life to the
    entire office? one would think her many personal calls would weigh upon her conscience,
    but she seems oblivious. should i send an anonymous note, let the office manager

    i am 26 years old and, aside from my wedding day, i have never worn makeup. several
    people have told me that "every woman needs makeup." i have pretty good skin,

    would like to try some foundation or something to help even out my complexion.

    i''m just not sure where to start. i am wary of beauty consultants who will try
    to sell me overpriced stuff that i don''t need. also, i am afraid my husband,
    who has been fine with my "au naturel" appearance, will wonder why i''m all of

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    prom and graduation season has arrived with all of the celebrating that goes along
    with it. so please print my letter for parents and teens to read -- perhaps together.
    my daughter was an honor student all through high school. we had a close relationship.
    i always made sure she knew she could come to me with any problem, whether it
    be her grades, alcohol or sex. on the issue of drinking and driving, i made her
    understand that wherever she was, i would gladly pick her up -- no questions asked.
    i have heard that many parents make the same offer to their children. i firmly
    believed that my daughter would call me if she needed to. however, she recently
    decided she could drive home after drinking what she considered to be "a safe
    amount of alcohol." unfortunately, she struck a utility pole on a sharp turn and
    flipped her car over. by the grace of god, she and her friend escaped with minor
    injuries. but, as you know, many people don''t survive such a horrific accident.
    abby, many parents say, "it won''t happen to my child." teens think they are invincible,
    but tragedy happens to people from all walks of life and all kinds of families.
    i feel blessed that both girls are still alive to appreciate their second lease
    on life, but it makes me sad to think about how many kids don''t return home each
    night. can you comment, abby? -- grateful mom in connecticut'

    i was appalled. then there was the adorable, precocious 2-year-old who said, "oh,

    that the little girl hears it from her other grandma all the time. how can the

    my boyfriend, "seth," and i are in our mid-20s and have been dating for seven
    years. we have a solid relationship, but i need your thoughts on something: he
    insists on cleaning up after everyone right under their noses. we were recently
    invited to watch a basketball game at a friend''s home. appetizers were provided
    over the course of several hours. people kept losing their cups and plates because
    seth "thought they were done" and threw the items away. abby, he was doing this
    in a house he had never visited before with people he had never met! he also does
    it with family instead of sitting and relaxing after the meal and enjoying the
    conversation. when we eat at a restaurant, seth will pile up our plates and silverware
    as soon as he thinks i''m done "to make it easier for the server to clean up."
    clearing the table was not a chore my boyfriend was assigned as a child, nor is
    he overly concerned with neatness in other areas of his life. he''s not shy around
    people, so he isn''t keeping busy to avoid conversation. he says he is being polite.
    i say he could volunteer to help tidy up at the end of a party, but he shouldn''t
    touch other people''s eating utensils in the middle of an event. what do you think?

    i''m a nanny and have been for three years. the 10-year-old girl i work with is
    wonderful, and i love her dearly. her parents are not abusive, but they are caught
    up in their own lives. they devote very little time or effort to their daughter.
    the only thing my employers ever talk to her about is school (she''s an a student)
    and academics. when they are home they spend very little time with her. they never
    buy her even tiny gifts "just because" -- only when she brings home a''s does
    she get gifts. of course she is upset by this. she confides in me, to the point
    of tears. how can i get her parents to take an active role in her life? i know
    better than to tell a parent how to be a parent, but they are slowly scarring
    their daughter and making her resent them. i know they love her, but their parenting
    makes her feel unlovable. -- nanny in new york'

    doesn''t know what to do about it, and i don''t either. i love my dad, but i have

    i disagreed with the examples you suggested to criticize that man to make him
    understand the impact it can have. for the most part, men respond differently
    to criticism than women do. if you tell most men, "you''re getting a paunch" or
    "your hair is getting thin," you won''t get as strong a reaction as when you tell
    a woman she''s getting fat. instead try, "you''re not very strong," "you don''t
    know much about sports, do you?" or "your lawn is looking kind of shabby," depending
    upon what the man is most vain about. then you may hit closer to home. -- henry

    i am 22, and a year and a half ago i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. i must
    inject myself with insulin four times a day. if i am going to be away from home
    for more than a few hours, i must bring my insulin and other supplies with me.
    when i''m in public -- like in a restaurant -- i feel as though going off alone
    to inject myself is denying a part of who i am, so i choose to remain visible
    when i inject. what is your take on this? i have never seen anyone else do it
    in plain view, but i would like to because diabetes is nothing to be ashamed of.
    people often ask questions when i do it, and i''m happy to answer them and to

    my parents are in their 70s. both are generous and loving. over the years mom
    has refused to accept any act of generosity or gift, large or small, from any
    of her children. this includes birthdays, their anniversary and all major holidays.
    in the past, she would return our gifts to the mall. in recent years we have resorted
    to giving her and dad gift cards or food because they can''t be returned. each
    time we do we get a lecture from her in a reprimanding tone, telling us we "spent
    too much." (we''re a practical clan; we do not spend a lot of money or buy anything
    lavish.) following the reprimand, mother then passes out large checks to each
    of us and our children. aside from the holidays, mom will not accept a dinner
    invitation at my home. when one of us hosts a family party, she insists on writing
    a check to cover the cost of the food. when we''re out for an occasional lunch
    or dinner, she grabs the check and becomes upset if one of us tries to pay for
    it. we''re all mature adults with good incomes. this quirk of hers has become
    frustrating and embarrassing. does mom have low self-esteem and can''t accept
    an act of generosity, or is she a control freak? if we eliminated the gift-giving,
    she would still continue doling out the checks. what can we do? -- over it in

    we recently got together with extended family to celebrate a child''s birthday
    at a family-oriented restaurant. one of the adults began bragging about how she
    had saved money because she paid for only one salad plate from the "all you can
    eat" salad bar. when she finished eating her salad, she passed her plate to another
    family member, who then had his fill and passed the plate along until all their
    immediate family members had eaten. we told her it was dishonest, that she''s
    stealing food from the restaurant because she didn''t pay for all the salads that
    were actually consumed by her family. she claimed that it wasn''t dishonest because
    it''s "all" you can eat. this has caused a huge disagreement within the family.

    i am wondering about the practicality of contacting my ex-wife about our unmarried,
    middle-aged daughter, "della." our daughter is an attractive (when she wants to
    be), well-educated woman who has her own business and has never given either of
    us cause for concern. however, some of the decisions della has made in the last
    year or so have not reflected what i consider to be basic common sense. two of
    the decisions involved considerable amounts of money. others involve day-to-day
    dealings with people in general. i have occasionally spoken up and raised questions
    about the decisions she has made, but della seems to neither understand nor appreciate
    my point of view. there is nothing illegal or unethical about what my daughter
    is doing, but her naivete at times makes her an easy mark for people who don''t
    have her best interests at heart. should i express my concern to della''s mother?

    up when we first became a couple. although she apologized for the problems she
    tried so hard to cause between us, all it did was dredge the feelings of anger

    me the chance to confront her, but under the guise of "wanting to be friends."

    be split, logan quickly says to put it all on one check -- and before i know it,
    he has already paid for both of our meals. i have told him before that i''d like
    to pay for some of our meals or, at least, be allowed to pay for my own -- but
    his response is always that i''m young and in college and he is working. i appreciate
    the gesture and his concern, but i feel a little insulted that someone would think
    i''m unable to take care of myself. it also makes me feel a little guilty when
    he always grabs the check. is there something i can do to assuage my conscience
    without insulting my friend? -- young, but not penniless, circleville, ohio'

    i have had several recent experiences of needing to grab only a few items and
    quickly check out of a store, only to find the express lane -- which is supposed
    to be for shoppers with 10 items or less -- occupied by someone with an entire
    cartload of items. what is the proper etiquette in this situation? should i say
    nothing and allow my time to be wasted by people who think they are entitled?
    should i mention it to the store manager or say something to the cashier in the
    presence of the offender? should i bite my lip or bring it to someone''s attention?
    as a former cashier, i feel it is the responsibility of the cashier working the
    express lane to regulate who comes into it, but the cashiers seem oblivious or

    i am a 30-year-old, attractive, recently divorced attorney and single mother.
    my problem is i become extremely threatened when i''m romantically rejected, and
    i need to know how to gain a healthier approach to rejection. i have dated occasionally,
    but nothing has developed into anything serious because i have yet to find someone
    with whom i feel completely compatible. however, when i start dating someone and
    he doesn''t feel the same, it negatively affects my self-esteem. i feel and act
    depressed, and then i begin feeling insecure, anxious and irrational. i recently
    drove someone away because when he didn''t call me one night, i went wild with
    anger and anxiety. i realize this heightened response is not normal. it is also
    quite painful. frankly, the intensity of my feelings frightened me, and i''m at

    i was repeatedly deceived by someone i thought was my friend. i keep telling myself
    it shouldn''t matter now, but the more the truth comes out, the harder it is for

    my mother is a widow living on a fixed income. from time to time various relatives
    have moved in with her. they offer limited financial assistance, but none appear
    inclined to keep the house in good repair. i have gone beyond my financial limits
    to help mama with emergencies, such as paying the light bill and making repairs
    to her house. my husband and i also clean up and do yard work over there. i am
    not an only child, but my siblings do not feel inclined to help out. yesterday,
    mama again asked me for financial help to make repairs to the house. did i mention
    there are four other people living there? while i never resent helping my mother,
    i sometimes do resent struggling to pay for upkeep and repairs to a home while
    other able-bodied adults living there benefit from my hard work. they are freeloading
    off my generosity. should i continue paying for my mother''s house and mine? i
    have offered several times to let her move in with me, but she can''t bear to
    give up her home. -- feeling used in georgia'

    i''m a freshman at a catholic university. i was awakened last night at 3 a.m.
    because my bunk bed -- i''m on top -- was shaking. then i heard my roommate moaning.
    she had snuck a boy into our dorm room, and they were doing "it." i am so upset
    at her disregard for my personal space that i don''t know how to talk to her.
    i''m big on chastity, but i don''t want her to think i''m speaking up because
    i''m a prude. i found it so upsetting that it was difficult to get back to sleep.
    my roommate is nice, and we get along well. how do i tell her this behavior is

    my boyfriend, "dirk," and i have been dating nearly three years, and we recently
    moved in together. before we met, he briefly dated a woman i''ll call "lola,"
    who has bipolar disorder. although she was the one to end the relationship, lola
    became jealous when she heard dirk was dating me and started following us around.
    dirk is a musician, and lola would dance provocatively at his shows, hang on him
    and hug him, and we would sometimes be kept up all night by her calls and texts.
    dirk has told lola many times that she''s crossing the line. eventually, she began
    seeing someone else and stopped tormenting us. but now that she has learned we''re
    living together, her crazy behavior has started up again. i went to pick dirk
    up from his show last night and heard that lola had told half the people in the
    club that he had "always loved her," that they were "soul mates," and that she
    would be going home with him! while i don''t doubt the stability of my relationship
    with dirk, i find lola''s behavior irritating and blatantly disrespectful. dirk
    tells me any confrontation would be counterproductive, and that the woman would
    be "overjoyed" to find out she''s causing me distress. he thinks she''s so unstable
    she might react violently. i''m fed up. what should we do? -- had it in manhattan'

    my ex-wife has been spending every weekend visiting her fiance, who is in prison.
    it is a five-hour round trip from where she lives, so she stays the night in a
    hotel due to the long drive. if she has our 6-year-old daughter, "emma," on the
    weekend, the child goes with her. my ex knows i don''t want emma in a prison.
    the only way i have to prevent my little girl from having to go is to keep her
    with me every weekend. my wife is supportive, but she is concerned because we
    never have a night to ourselves. she says we are enabling my ex''s poor choices
    by taking emma every time my ex wants to shirk her parental responsibility. is
    my wife right? are we enabling my ex? is it more important to keep my daughter
    away from the prison or take my wife out on a date once a month? any advice would
    be greatly appreciated. -- dad in georgia'

    last night, i went to the movies and took an aisle seat in the back row. two different
    couples came in late, and each one asked me to move over so they could sit together.
    i said, "i got here early, and i like this seat." i did not go on to explain that
    i have a torn tendon in my knee and needed the seat in order to stretch my leg.
    they became upset and were very rude. if the seats were so important, they could
    have arrived early or on time. abby, my husband died in an airplane crash many

    the oldest of the cousins in our family is being married in july. my aunt told
    me over the holidays that because i am now an adult (i will graduate from college
    in june), i would be receiving my own invitation rather than be included with
    my parents. my invitation arrived today and enclosed with it was a personal note
    from my cousin encouraging the attendance of my boyfriend, who she says would
    be welcome as well. i believe that because i received my own invitation and will
    be bringing a guest, i should arrive with my own gift rather than sign my name

    my husband recently caught a cold, and he has been coughing badly. other than
    the cough, he is in good shape and not feverish. last night his coughing woke
    me up three times. the first time, i went back to sleep. the second time, i asked
    him to sleep somewhere else so he wouldn''t wake me up, and the third time, i
    got up and slept on the couch. we disagree on who should have left the room. he
    says he was sick, so he was right to stay in bed. i say he was the one who couldn''t
    sleep and, therefore, he should''ve left the room. i know when i can''t sleep,
    i usually leave the room so i won''t disturb him. abby, we have a 20-month-old
    son who regularly wakes me up at night, and i''m usually the one who gets up for
    him. i get less than six hours'' sleep a night -- and that''s when my son sleeps
