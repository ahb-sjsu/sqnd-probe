    the letter from "no dogs in the car" you printed last year (aug. 6) appeared one
    day too late for me. i pulled into a supermarket parking lot on a hot afternoon
    and, as i was getting out of my car, i heard a dog barking and whining. it was
    a sweet little yorkshire terrier that had been locked in a brand-new luxury vehicle
    with the windows barely cracked open. i couldn''t tell how long he had been there,
    but his barking suggested he was not comfortable. i walked over to see if i could
    open the door. a well-dressed woman came out of the store, saw me and shrieked,
    "why are you standing next to my car?" i explained that because of the heat, her
    dog should not have been left in the enclosed vehicle. her response? "mind your
    own business, you dumb (rhymes-with-witch)!" she screamed and then stormed off.
    i read the letter in your column from "no dogs" the following day and made a copy.
    i hope i run into that "charming" woman again so i can hand her one. -- bonnie''s

    i am in my early 40s. most of my good friends, whom i have known my whole life,
    have not given a second thought to our approaching "golden years." no one is saving
    money for retirement, participating in any sort of plan or even thinking about
    how they will manage later in life. they all have fun, interesting, low-paying
    jobs. this mindset may have been fine 20 years ago, but we aren''t kids anymore.
    i worry that when my friends are senior citizens they will be destitute. they
    laugh off my worries. my parents are enjoying a modest but comfortable retirement

    perhaps you can settle a minor disagreement between a fellow bartender and me.
    i say it is impolite to remove a cash tip from the bar before a patron leaves.
    she, however, just grabs the money and counts it -- right in front of the customer.
    she thinks it''s ok because the customer wants to be acknowledged and thanked.
    abby, i always thank my customers, whether they tip or not, and i think counting

    was chubby, and sean told us she was on a diet. we found out later taryn was 5
    1/2 months pregnant. as time went on, she grew larger and larger. we asked sean
    if she could be pregnant. he told us he had asked her and she said no, that she
    was just built like her mother. (she told her co-workers the same thing.) late
    one night, our surprised and upset son called to tell us taryn had just delivered
    a full-term, 7-pound baby boy. her doctor and her friends have all said she didn''t
    know what was going on. even after the baby was born, she asked the doctor "what
    was happening." she couldn''t believe she''d had a baby. taryn told sean she had
    had her period the whole nine months and never felt the baby move. the doctor
    told my son that some girls don''t know when they are pregnant, so now he believes
    her! we have had many family discussions about this. i am the mother of six children,

    was pregnant, even though she had been asked directly more than once? we feel

    i am the father of a middle-aged, unmarried, well-educated daughter i''ll call

    seems to find it difficult to converse with me. it''s most noticeable when i''m
    sharing something with her, not the other way around. she''ll comment on what
    i have to say, but rarely show any real interest in knowing more. "how are you?"
    is about all she ever asks. it has been this way for years, and it has affected
    my wanting to spend time with her. (neither of us comes from a background where
    love or affection was openly displayed.) when i called it to yvette''s attention,
    she told me she doesn''t like to pry, that she figures i''ll tell her whatever
    i want her to know. she doesn''t seem to understand that, without some display
    of interest on her part, it''s difficult for me to know if she''s interested in
    what i''m saying. i know she routinely "tunes out" her mother -- my ex-wife --
    who dominates conversations with almost everyone. that isn''t my m.o.! yvette

    proud of me. but after reading only one chapter, the book was left on the nightstand
    and he hasn''t touched it since. scott is a talented writer. he has been published
    in literary magazines, but hasn''t yet published a book. i sympathize with his
    jealousy and have tried to keep talk of my novel to a minimum. but i''m troubled
    by scott''s refusal to participate in this exciting period of my life. if he had
    written a 600-page tome on the digestive habits of the three-toed sloth, and i
    had to drink a pot of coffee to stay awake through the first chapter, i would

    i have been married for 12 years to the most self-centered man in the world. he''s
    an astute businessman and a good provider, but when he comes home our conversations
    are always about him. the moment i start talking about things i think are important,
    he turns on his tv or shushes me. i have told him many times how hurtful it is.
    i feel lonely and unimportant when the things i care about are pushed to the side.

    my husband of three years, "mike," is never home. he goes to work and then hangs
    out with his buddies, leaving me at home with our baby and my two other children
    until late at night. on weekends, mike jumps out of bed, showers and leaves --
    sometimes not returning until the wee hours of the morning. he says he''s "with
    friends." most of the time he doesn''t bother to call, but when he does i''m usually
    so mad i don''t answer the phone. mike says he "needs his time." well, what about
    our time as a couple and as a family? i told him i feel like i''m running a bed-and-breakfast.
    my friends say they think mike has someone else. i''m not sure. this has been
    going on for a year and a half, and i am tired of it. he rarely agrees to watch
    the baby if i have to run to the store. when he''s home, all he does is play video
    games. abby, mike is 34 years old. i am 41. he has touched me only once in the
    last four months. i feel rejected, lonely and miss the closeness. what should

    i am a small-business owner who does the hiring for my company. i hope you will
    share some suggestions for young people who are now applying for postgraduate
    jobs. (1) every contact with a prospective employer is a mini-interview. present
    yourself appropriately. i have received many inappropriate e-mails. example: "hey,
    when would this gig start?" please remember to use a salutation and communicate
    politely and clearly. (2) many companies post a great deal of information about
    job openings on their web sites. read the site carefully before calling so i won''t
    waste time answering questions you could have answered on your own. (3) shortcuts
    may be cute when text-messaging your friends, but in business they are annoying
    and unprofessional. avoid messages such as "thnx 4 ur help. talk 2 u later!" (4)
    because i must read your resume and application, please proofread it for spelling,
    grammar and typos. (5) many internet sites now offer free e-mail. set up an account
    using your name or initial so i don''t have to e-mail "hotchick99" with an offer
    to teach young children. (6) if you have a phone interview, please find a quiet
    place from which to place the call. it is difficult to understand you above your
    roommate who is cursing over a video game. (7) never, ever tell a prospective
    employer you are waiting to hear about a job you want more, that pays more or
    gives you more "fun" time. simply say you are "exploring all your options," and
    i will understand. by the way, abby, i am not an old fuddy-duddy. i am a 26-year-old
    professional who expects more from my peers than i have seen. -- exasperated recruiter

    i''m trying to go outside to calm down. she will position herself in front of

    other hand, i don''t try to flaunt it either. a season of summer gatherings, parties
    and celebrations is here, and i''d like to dress for them. should i stick to high-collared
    tops (which make me feel frumpy) or wear dresses and blouses that reveal the scars?
    my close friends are used to them, but i don''t want to shock strangers at the
    hors d''oeuvres table. this may seem like vanity when so many struggle for health,

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my mother was abusive. when i was 13, she thought it was "cute" to set me up on
    a date with a 21-year-old marine on leave. when i was 15, she told me that if
    she had known she could get an abortion in the ''60s, i wouldn''t be here. you
    get the picture. although she had no time for me when i was growing up, after
    her husband died she suddenly became clingy. she''d call me at work at 8 a.m.
    demanding that i drive 20 miles on my lunch break to bring her a pizza. (due to
    obesity and ill health, she was pretty much housebound.) she spent the last 18
    months of her life in a rest home. but her demands became worse. there were frantic
    phone calls at 2 a.m. to come sit with her because she was "lonely." when i''d
    rush over, i''d find her sleeping. she called me four or five times during the
    day, and even more often in the evening. i gritted my teeth and performed like
    the good daughter i thought i was. it was infuriating to hear the doctors and
    nurses say what a loving mother she was, how proud of me she was, blah, blah ...
    her death was a relief. i still run into people who ask about her, and when i
    tell them she''s gone, they ask how i''m holding up. how do i tell them i''m fine?
    i haven''t grieved at all since her death a year ago, nor do i feel sad. the only
    thing i feel sad about is the fact that i don''t feel sad! i''m not an unfeeling
    person. your thoughts? -- feeling guilty in santa rosa, calif.'

    my brother "albert''s" in-laws charge him and his new wife to attend family events.
    example: when they are invited to the in-laws'' lake house, they must bring $20
    to cover the gas for the boat. last christmas they were charged $10 apiece for
    the family''s annual shrimp boil, and $50 for a grandparent''s birthday party.
    the in-laws are not poor. they could well afford to host these events for their
    relatively small family. albert and his wife, however, are newlyweds. they don''t
    have a lot of spare cash. nevertheless, their attendance at these family events
    is expected. i believe to charge a guest money to attend a gathering like this
    is a social blunder. albert says that''s the price of marrying into the family.

    i am happily married to the most wonderful woman in the world. i feel blessed
    to have her in my life and to be a part of hers. i am not an elitist; i like to
    think i am a humble person. but i do believe in correct grammar, proper pronunciation
    and the eloquent employment of words in conversation. my wife did not have the
    benefit of an upbringing in which these were practiced. she comes from the "ain''t
    got no" school of speaking. i can accept this at home, but in business as a corporate
    executive, i am embarrassed by her low verbal skills. i would never hurt or shame
    my wife by correcting her in front of anyone. the obvious answer is to bring it
    up in private. i did that, but she is not inclined to improve her word skills.

    i live in chicago and commute to and from work each day on the el train, which
    is typically crowded. there are never enough seats to go around. what surprises
    me is the lack of thoughtfulness that men show when it comes to seating. it''s
    extremely rare for a man to offer a seat to a lady. in fact, i have watched men
    race past women to grab seats. just the other day, there was a very pregnant woman
    on the train and not a single person offered her a seat. i''m not trying to portray

    my children and i were living with a maniac who threatened to kill me if i took
    the kids and ran. we reached out to his family, hoping they would intervene and
    tell him they knew what he was doing to us. we wanted someone to stand up to him.
    his sister said: "i don''t want to hear this. i love my brother. i don''t want
    to think about him doing these things, so don''t tell me these stories!" his father
    said, "what did you do to provoke him?" his brother and his wife were sympathetic,
    but said there was nothing they could do. the last violent episode ended with
    the children and me locking ourselves in the bathroom while my husband screamed
    and tried to break the door down for half an hour. when he finally stopped, i
    called his dad who said, "do you know what time it is? you woke me up!" he hung
    up the phone so fast i didn''t get to tell him what his son had done to our autistic
    son. after getting help from outside sources, we finally felt safe enough to leave.
    we''re now divorced, and my daughter wants nothing to do with her father''s side
    of the family. her granddad can''t figure out why she won''t talk to him, and
    her aunt has no clue why my daughter refuses to visit. abby, please urge family

    a daughter who was born four months after his return to active duty. mark and
    his wife named their baby hope, which signified what he wanted to offer his children
    and all children. the moment of remembrance and our year-long, lifelong determination
    to "live honoring america''s fallen" are in memory of army capt. mark stubenhofer
    and all those brave members of our military who have died in the service of our
    nation. we invite all americans to pause in their memorial day activities at 3:00

    i am 25 and have fallen in love with "brad," a wonderful and very successful businessman.
    on a recent trip out of town, my co-workers were joking that we were going to
    elope. i told brad about it and how ridiculous it was, since we have been dating
    only about six months. he replied that we couldn''t elope because i haven''t signed
    a pre-nup! i stewed over it for a couple of days and, because i couldn''t get
    it off my mind, brought it up again and asked him if he was serious. brad said
    he was. he said he has worked hard for what he has (which i understand) and mentioned
    the fact that i have a failed first marriage. i didn''t think that was fair. my
    husband had cheated on me, and we were married only a few months. we talked further,
    and brad said if he thought i was with him because of his money, he wouldn''t
    be with me. i understand his reasons for wanting a pre-nup, but doesn''t getting
    one indicate that we are preparing to fail? i am pretty sure marriage will be
    in our future, and i''ll sign a pre-nup (after my attorney reviews it), but it
    seems like negative thinking. how can i get my head around this? -- don''t feel

    i have recently gotten to know a lovely lady i''ll call "judith," whose son is
    being married in august. during a recent trip to florida, judith mentioned that
    she was looking for a dress to wear to the wedding and asked where she might find
    something nice. the next day, the woman she had spoken to arrived with a beautiful
    gown she had worn only once. the dress is lovely and of excellent quality. it
    fits and looks perfect on judith. after showing the dress to her future daughter-in-law,
    judith received an e-mail from the young woman stating that the dress will "clash"
    with her ivory wedding dress and might look "dirty" next to it. (the dress is
    a light metallic gold.) she also told judith that the purse was too gaudy. is
    it the bride''s place to tell the mother of the groom what to wear? -- friend

    i am not sure how to handle my boyfriend''s hair loss. "jasper" is 34 and i''m
    23. we have been dating for two years and have a wonderful relationship. we are
    completely open to each other, and because of that, i feel backed into a corner
    regarding this subject. hair loss is such a tricky topic. women aren''t supposed
    to care, but in reality we do -- unless you''re one of those rare women who enjoy
    bald heads. (i''m not one of them.) although jasper''s hair loss is barely noticeable
    now, without some sort of plan it will probably take over in a few years. jasper
    is self-conscious about his thinning hair. i can tell he''s worried, but he doesn''t
    want to do anything about it. i care more about jasper''s feelings than his hair,
    so i haven''t let him know how much it bothers me, although he asks me often.
    his type of hair loss is treatable. i find him very attractive now, but i don''t
    know how i will feel when he''s bald, and i''m sort of cringing inside about it.
    i feel like a daily ritual would not be too much to ask of someone. i''m fed up
    with hearing, "if you love him, let him be" because my attraction to him is an
    important part of our lives. what should i do? -- tired of sitting on my hands'

    i disagree with your reply to "nicki in maryland" (march 23), the retail saleswoman
    who is tired of being not only touched, but physically pulled about by customers.
    everyone has personal space, and this includes service industry employees. a light
    touch on the arm is one thing; to be pulled or regularly touched on the shoulders
    and hands is quite another. to suggest that nicki tolerate such behavior to keep
    a customer, or find another line of work, is disappointing. frankly, some customers
    are not worth keeping, or should be educated that retail workers are human beings
    who deserve to be respected as such. maybe nicki likes her job. why should she
    give it up because of the occasional behavior of the rude and insensitive? perhaps
    the job works for her because of personal or school issues. retail jobs often
    have the most flexible schedules. as a former retail employee, i have many fond
    memories, but i also remember people from all levels of society who believe that

    i am a 38-year-old woman. my fiance of five years, "troy," and i live together
    and are the parents of a 5-month-old baby girl. we have been going out recently
    to dance at our favorite club, but every time we go, troy disappears and leaves
    me with his best friend -- sometimes up to five hours at a time. the club has
    several stories, with many secluded nooks, so troy is hard to find. when i finally
    locate him, he''s sweaty and has a weird look on his face. when i ask where he
    was and why he disappeared, i get no answers. his friend covers for him. my fiance
    and i have never had a night out without this guy coming with us, and i''m tired
    of troy''s disappearing act. something is going on. he calls me paranoid, but
    i think if you leave your fiancee every time you go out, something is not right.
    am i being paranoid? or does he have someone stashed in the club waiting for him?

    a man i know is engaged to a woman 20 years younger. i think she''s a gold digger,

    "look what i''ve got!" (he was not present.) after he bought her a million-dollar
    house, she told her kids that they have to "act rich" now, and after he bought
    her a new car, she drove it -- slowly -- around her ex-husband''s neighborhood
    so everyone could see it. she was unfaithful to her ex several times with wealthy
    men, and has told her friends that if they want to meet men with money, they should
    go to the expensive golf courses. she complains to her kids about her fiance behind
    his back, but tells them they need to "treat him nice" and "act happy" around
    him because he has given them lots of money. and as soon as she got her diamond

    i''m a seasoned curmudgeon and have been retired quite awhile. why is a man considered
    "anti-social" and in need of counseling because he wants to enjoy his few remaining
    years by being left alone? that''s why they call it "retirement." if a man has
    been a productive member of society, provided for his family, been there for his
    children and been a good husband, does he need to have his last little bit of

    my mother needs help, but will not listen to my brother or me. she has always
    respected your advice, and she needs it desperately now. mama is a retired nurse.
    a little over a year ago, she moved from florida to virginia to live with her
    boyfriend, "rudy." rudy is extremely wealthy. he owns three homes and commercial
    real estate. however, he suffers from mental illness. mama has told us that rudy
    is bipolar. he also has no respect for women. he orders her around, and she must
    answer "yes, sir" or "no, sir." even though this man has millions, he and mama
    are living in one room above a barn. rudy''s wife died several years ago. he has
    two sons, neither of whom speak to him. mama says she moved from her lovely home
    to live with him because she''s "looking at the big picture." because rudy is
    wealthy, she wants us to benefit from what he has, even if she doesn''t. my brother
    and i can''t bear her living like this. their room has limited plumbing and --
    to put it politely -- it smells. there is also evidence of rodents. please, abby,

    were strewn on a coffee table, surrounded by envelopes and stamps. the hostess
    instructed us to write on these folded cards our names and what we had given the

    but not to seal them so (i assume) the "too busy" bride-to-be could sign her name.

    i have been divorced for four years. about nine months ago, i met "cecil," a wonderful
    man who was widowed three years ago. we have fallen in love. the problem is his
    adult daughter, "wanda." she told me she won''t allow some "conniving woman" to
    get her hooks into her father. she says falling in love with me is an insult to
    her mother''s memory. wanda made it plain she feels i am with her father only
    because i''m after his money. cecil is comfortable financially, although not wealthy.
    now that she''s aware that we have become serious, wanda has begun trying to instill
    guilt and shame in her father. this is exceedingly difficult for him because wanda
    is his only child. what his daughter fails to understand is that i am secure financially.
    my home is paid off. i have assets and investments, a comfortable income and a
    future pension. i would be proud to become cecil''s wife, but if he were to ask
    me to continue our relationship without marriage, i would stay with him. furthermore,
    if he proposed and wanted a pre-nup, i would gladly sign one. i stand ready to
    love not only him, but also wanda, if she could only open her heart to me -- not
    as a replacement for her mother, but as a loving, caring friend. what she does
    not know is that her parents never had the happy marriage she thought they did.
    they stayed together largely because of her. what do you advise? i don''t want
    to have to walk away so cecil won''t have to lose his daughter. -- loves him for
    all the right reasons'

    i have made a decision (at least for now) not to date or try to find a husband.

    have decided the abuse will end with me. i know that if i ever met a really awesome

    night, and i filed for divorce. i pawned my wedding band and engagement ring.
    the clerk asked if i was going to buy a divorce ring. i had never heard of one.
    i searched online, found a nice one, ordered it and wear it proudly. cooper and

    me the sole wage-earner. i have told ellie repeatedly that she and bill must learn
    to budget and pay their bills, and advised them to seek professional debt and
    marriage counseling, neither of which they have done. several months ago, ellie
    called to ask if the family could move in with us until they got on their feet.
    my husband refused, telling her that without counseling their habits were not
    going to change, and we could not afford to support them short of a true emergency.
    ellie was furious. she joined a "swingers" club and began a series of love affairs.

    "rescue" her in her "hour of need." i''m upset that i have made the girls'' situation

    my husband, "duane," had a serious drinking problem for more than 25 years. he
    has dried out. however, the past has come back to haunt us. his daughter, "jackie,"
    told me that when she was 2, duane raped her. jackie said she still dreams about
    wanting to kill him. i can''t blame her, and i don''t believe she''s lying. i
    do not plan to divorce duane. i think jackie''s mother should have prosecuted
    him when it happened, but she failed her daughter just as my husband did. having
    been a victim of rape myself, i can relate to jackie''s pain. i was 6 when my
    dad began molesting me. i would like to be supportive, help to heal these wrongs
    and watch jackie blossom into a wonderful, loving person -- a side of her she
    has already shown me she possesses. i love duane, but i''m not in love with him.
    he can be a jerk sometimes. i think joint counseling might help. she and her brother
    both have terrible memories of "dad." since we''ve been married, we have had a

    i just made the biggest career mistake of my life. i was working for a wonderful
    company. then a former co-worker told me about a management position opening at
    the agency she went to work for. i thought it would be my golden opportunity for
    advancement. i submitted my resume and, after two interviews, got the job. the
    problem: this is the unfriendliest company i have ever seen. management belittles
    staff. praise is seldom given. there is no kindness, no "good mornings" uttered
    -- the people here are just plain mean. i am a friendly, outgoing person, and
    i''m having a hard time adapting. i miss my old job. i realize now that i made
    a hasty decision, and i don''t know what to do. my old position has been filled,

    my husband, "lee," and i have been married two years and have kept all of our

    was away on a business trip, lee moved my car and parked it in our circular driveway.

    that damage was done to my car when i wasn''t even in the vicinity. i feel that,
    as a minimum, lee should pay half of my car''s deductible. he refuses because

    i have been dating "jim," a single father of an 18-year-old son and a 13-year-old
    daughter, "jenna." the girl is very close to her parents to the point that she
    sleeps with them. on nights she''s with jim, she shares a bed with him. jim and
    his ex have been divorced since jenna was 2. she shared their bed while they were
    married. i no longer bring up the subject. i guess you could say jim and i have
    agreed to disagree. however, i don''t think a 13-year-old girl should be sharing
    a bed with her father. to put it bluntly, it gives me the creeps. jenna also shares
    her father''s master bedroom and closet with him as if she were his wife. please
    understand, this girl has a lavish bathroom of her own connected to a princess-style
    bedroom that contains everything a girl could ever wish for. space is not the
    problem. when she visits, she never sets foot in her own room or bathroom. i haven''t
    said anything to jenna because i don''t want to upset her, but i think it''s inappropriate

    i am struggling with the question of whether or not to reveal a confidence made
    more than two years ago. my boyfriend at the time, "jerry," revealed to me that
    he was gay. we remained friends, but i moved on and started dating someone else.
    jerry never confided his secret to anyone else and, eventually feeling overcome
    with depression, took his own life. jerry told me more than once that he knew
    how his parents would feel if he told them he was gay. he saw the way they snickered
    when they saw a gay couple. they made it very clear to him that they didn''t think
    it was normal. jerry was sure, seeing the way his parents viewed gay people, that
    this was how he, too, would be viewed. his parents are now blaming me for the
    fact that jerry took his own life. they say it was because we broke up. would
    it be selfish of me to tell them the truth -- that they are the real reason? or
    should i continue to keep his secret? -- his best friend, rochester, n.y.'

    my husband and i went to a restaurant tonight hoping to enjoy a relaxing evening
    of quiet conversation. unfortunately, a man dominated all the conversations in
    the small restaurant by continually talking in a very loud voice. the same thing
    happened several months ago, when our quiet dinner was interrupted by an elderly
    woman across the room who talked loudly the entire time we were there. she seemed
    to be hard of hearing, so we felt some sympathy for her. the man tonight, however,
    seemed to hear just fine. abby, if my children were talking that loudly in a public
    place, i''d admonish them to use their "indoor voices." how do we handle the situation

    i''m 26 and concerned about my parents'' future. they are in their late 40s and
    have absolutely nothing saved for retirement. dad has a physically demanding job
    and won''t be able to do it forever, and they are currently in debt up to their
    ears. there are six kids in our family. i appreciate the fact that my parents
    are blowing off some steam when it comes to spending money, since they were unable
    to do it while we were all younger. however, i feel it''s time they look at the
    big picture. if something was to happen to dad or he was unable to work, they''d
    lose everything. at this point, they will be unable to pay for any of their own
    expenses when they''re older, and my siblings and i don''t have money to support
    them. our youngest brother still lives at home and is adopting the same spending

    from time to time you print letters about finding "pennies from heaven." are you
    ready for another one? our daughter is adopting a little boy, and our other daughter
    was hosting a yard sale to raise money for the airfare to bring the child to this
    country. my mother, a widow, had donated my father''s racing bike. it was hard
    for her to let go of it because dad had won many senior olympic medals with it.
    the bike sold the first day, and i immediately called mom to tell her the news.
    right after i hung up the phone with her, i looked down at the table where my
    grandsons had been helping me count change. in the middle of a pile of dimes was
    a penny. when i picked it up, i saw it was a "wheatie." then i turned it over
    and couldn''t believe my eyes. the date on the penny was 1918, the year my father
    was born. although this may not be your typical "pennies from heaven" story, i
    truly believe it was a penny from heaven -- a message from dad that he was glad

    my boyfriend, "richie," and i have been together three years. richie watches his
    pennies, so i was very surprised two days before valentine''s day to return from
    a family trip and find a gorgeous vase of professionally arranged flowers and
    a small heart-shaped box of chocolates on my coffee table. i was very impressed,
    surprised and excited. i asked richie where he got them, and he told me the name
    of a high-priced florist. i was off work the day before valentine''s day, so i
    went out, bought expensive wine and filet mignon and made a fantastic home-cooked
    meal for him. when richie got home from work, i asked him again where he got the
    flowers, and he again named the florist. i asked if he really went and got them,
    and if they were really intended for me. (it was just so out of character for
    him to splurge like that. the arrangement must have cost at least $100.) when
    he didn''t respond, i probed some more. he finally confessed they were from a
    funeral his parents had attended the day before i got home. can you believe richie
    was trying to pass off flowers from a complete stranger''s funeral as nice flowers
    he got me for valentine''s day? he lied to me. now he says i''m ungrateful and
    that there''s nothing wrong with what he did! i told him he is greedy and cheap,
    and the thoughtful thing to do with leftover funeral flowers would have been to
    take them to a cancer ward at a hospital or to a local nursing home. what do you

    when our real estate agent was showing us our house three years ago, the woman
    who lives next door walked into the back yard where we were standing to introduce
    herself. after we moved in, she knocked on our door one night carrying dinner
    for the two of us. it seemed like a neighborly gesture. we responded with a thank-you
    note. over the next few days, food would be laid at our door, always with a post-it
    note saying, "from bea." soon she asked us to take care of her cats and plants
    while she went out of town for a week. we asked if she would reciprocate when
    we were away -- she agreed. after we returned from our trip, a woman i hardly
    knew came up to me at the market and said, "i love your home! i can''t believe
    you even have contrasting piping on the lining of your drawers!" apparently, bea
    had taken her on a tour of our house in our absence. when i told bea i didn''t
    appreciate it, she got angry with the woman for telling me! over the summer, i
    noticed bea going quickly from place to place in the neighborhood with a smirk
    on her face. without asking, she would take her lawn mower and mow people''s yards
    when she felt the grass was too high. once she tried to encourage me to help her
    cut back the branches of another neighbor''s tree that she felt was overgrown.
    her husband says she never feels guilty, only sad at getting caught. her most

    i was a healthy, vibrant mother of one with a steady government job. i saw my
    doctor regularly for checkups, since both my parents have high blood pressure.
    as an active, health-conscious vegetarian, i thought i was at my physical peak.
    when i experienced nausea and lower back pain, i expected my doctor to tell me
    my 4-year-old daughter was going to have a sister or brother. instead, i was informed
    that my kidneys were barely working and i needed to see a specialist at once.
    that''s when my life began spinning out of control. i was told i would need dialysis
    to keep me alive! how could this happen? where were the warning signs and symptoms?
    why wasn''t my kidney function checked during previous doctor visits? there were
    no answers to these questions. no one in my family was able to donate a kidney
    to me because everyone had high blood pressure. so i went on dialysis and learned
    everything i could about kidney disease. after 10 years of dialysis, i finally
    received a successful kidney transplant. many people don''t realize that high
    blood pressure and diabetes are the two leading causes of kidney disease. more
    than 26 million americans have chronic kidney disease, and millions more are at
    risk. screening for kidney function is not part of a routine physical examination,
    and kidney disease generally shows no symptoms -- so if you have a family history
    of high blood pressure or diabetes, you are at risk. simple blood and urine tests
    could save your life. so please don''t put off what you can take care of today.

    i have had sole custody of my three children from a previous marriage for the
    past 10 years. their mother, "nadine," has mental health issues that prevent her
    from being a competent parent. she has let them down countless times and has caused
    emotional scars. as a result, the children have limited contact with nadine, even
    though she lives nearby. our oldest daughter, "holly," who is now 22, has chosen
    not to speak to her mom for more than a year. i believe part of nadine''s mental
    troubles stem from a secret she has been keeping. i have suspected for years that
    holly is not my biological daughter. and if she''s not, i know the identity of
    her biological father. do i tell holly? do i get a paternity test to find out

    our granddaughter and her twin brother are turning 13. my husband and i wanted
    to celebrate this milestone birthday with a candlelight spaghetti dinner at our
    house that includes their boyfriend/girlfriend. we planned to get out the china
    and silver and eat in the formal dining room. our daughter was on board, and the
    kids were excited. our daughter''s former in-laws, however, threw a fit about
    the children being "too young to date." obviously, we''ll honor our ex-son-in-law''s
    wishes, but we''re terribly disappointed, as are the kids. since when is dinner
    at home with your grandparents and your boyfriend and girlfriend considered a
    date? or are we out of touch with reality? -- canceled in red oak, texas'

    i have been dating a lovely woman, "bethany," for the past seven months. i''m
    30 and bethany is 29. she''s a teacher, and i work in health care. we met online,
    then talked on the phone and eventually decided to meet. abby, i was attracted
    to her from the moment i saw her. over these past months i have bonded with bethany''s
    family and have fallen in love with her. i would like nothing more than to make
    her my wife. i haven''t asked her yet, although we have joked about it. two nights
    ago we went to dinner, and the whole time something felt "off" to me. when we
    returned to bethany''s place, she informed me out of the blue that she would like
    to take a break from "us." she said she feels rushed into a new relationship without
    having closure from her previous one, which lasted six years and was difficult.
    before i became too upset, i got up off the couch and left. we haven''t talked
    since, as i want to give her the "space" she has requested. i love bethany, and
    i''m afraid i am going to lose her. how long should i go without making contact
    with her? -- troubled in jacksonville, n.c.'

    my husband''s sister, "mia," is a lesbian who came out to her family 10 years
    ago. her parents disowned her. we were just out of high school, and for years
    we had no idea why. we were not allowed to invite mia to our wedding or to have
    any contact with her. several years later, she began trying to repair their relationship,
    despite the fact that she''s forbidden to talk about her life or bring her partner
    anywhere near them. this was when we learned what had happened, and we were appalled
    at how mia had been treated. when she comes to town for holidays, she stays with
    us. because of this, my in-laws treat us like "sinners" just as they do her, and
    we''re caught in the middle. we have tried explaining to these family members
    that they are entitled to their position and we''re entitled to ours; that mia
    is family and deserves respect and kindness. they call us liberal freaks with
    no moral values and say we should stand up to her and not let her "manipulate"
    us. my husband and i are tired of the drama we get at holiday time. not only do
    they usually pick a fight with mia while she''s here, but they also won''t speak
    to us for two weeks afterward. the last two times she came, mia has either had
    to cut her trip short or has been reduced to tears by the harsh words from family
    members. if you wonder why mia even bothers coming home, it''s because she wants
    to maintain contact with us and she loves her nieces and nephews. how do we handle

    out of high school when he was a senior. his driver''s license was suspended due

    admitted he had a drug problem. we sent keith to a 30-day residential drug treatment
    facility. when he got out, he stayed in a halfway house for three months, then
    lived with another recovering addict in an apartment. keith had a job then, but
    lost it and moved back home. he still hangs out with his same old friends. he
    sleeps all day, gets up late in the afternoon or early in the evening, and goes

    off and on over the past two years, but is currently unemployed. i have tried

    follow their suggestions. we beg him to get his ged, but he lies to us that he''s
    going to school and working on it. keith asks me to wake him so i can take him
    to apply for jobs, but when i do, he refuses to get up. his dad and i have to
    hide our wallets because he has stolen our checks and credit cards before. his
    purchases are usually at gas stations and fast food restaurants. keith tells us
    he''s not using anymore, but his actions make it hard to believe. i can''t live
    my life standing idly by, watching my son ruin his life. i love him. if i don''t
    stand by him and try to help him, he has no one. his dad acts like he hates him.

    last year on valentine''s day i had many errands to run, so i started at my favorite
    coffee shop at 7 a.m. at a table in front of me was an elderly couple who were
    already eating. i enjoy people-watching, and it was easy to observe them. the
    man was having trouble opening his little package of jelly. i almost went over
    to help him. why didn''t i? because he was there with a lady. sister, wife, friend?
    i couldn''t see her left hand. if i had offered help, it might have embarrassed
    him. this was a buffet breakfast. as i ate, i watched him make several slow trips
    for food. he put milk and sugar in her dry cereal. he cut her food and twice wiped
    her mouth with her napkin. he put sugar and cream in her coffee and stirred it.
    when they finally finished, he helped her from her chair, helped her with her
    coat, straightened out her folding walker, held her arm as they left and helped
    her into an older model car. that vignette made my day. were they sweethearts?
    i don''t know, but there certainly was a lot of love there. not a word was spoken,
    but i''m sure the message was received. we could use more of that kind of "conversation"
    every day, not just on valentine''s day. -- s. from tennessee'

    when i recently moved to ohio, i left behind a group of dear friends. one of them,
    "cheryl," and i talk on the phone almost every night. everyone in this group got
    along beautifully. we had great times and have fabulous memories of growing up
    together. ten years ago, while i was away at college, the group had a falling
    out having to do with cheryl. it was silly and childish -- it was over a "boy."
    it was soon forgotten and apologies were offered. but cheryl held a grudge and
    refused to speak to any of the others. abby, more than a decade has passed. we''re
    all married now, with kids and jobs. i love cheryl dearly, but she refuses to
    reconcile. she''s extremely sensitive, and the mere mention of the subject starts
    her whining about the "mistreatment" she endured. so even though i''m far away,
    once again, i must listen to her constant complaint that she has no friends except
    me. she''s upset that i moved away. i''m tired of splitting my time between her
    and the rest of my friends when i return for a visit. how can i convince cheryl
    that there is a group of girls who miss her terribly and just need her to grow
    up enough to forgive and forget? -- torn in dayton, ohio'

    i have a close friend, "ethel," about whom i''m very worried. she sees a therapist,
    "amy," once a week for depression and suicidal thoughts, and while i think it''s
    a wonderful idea, i''m concerned because she has become "friends" with her therapist.
    this has gone as far as gift-giving, attending the therapist''s wedding, etc.
    i always thought it was a breach of professional boundaries for a therapist to
    become friends with his or her patient. i am the one who gets the 4 a.m. phone
    calls when ethel is feeling like the world is ending for her. she says my son
    and i are the only reason she doesn''t do something to herself. when i ask ethel
    why she doesn''t discuss this with amy, or call her at 4 a.m., ethel says she
    doesn''t want to burden her with her problems. she also refers to her appointments
    as "visiting" with amy and says that they have lovely talks about amy''s family,
    etc. i''m a single mother with a full-time job, taking classes at the university
    for my mba. i try to make as much time as i can for ethel, but i''m worn out and
    worried about those 4 a.m. phone calls. after seeing this therapist for five years,
    wouldn''t you think ethel would at least be a little bit better? if anything,
    i think she''s worse. i have suggested that ethel find another therapist, but

    my 4-year-old grandson, "teddy," is the apple of my eye. i recently learned that
    my son-in-law has been taking teddy hunting for deer and sees no harm in it. at
    his age, my grandson should be at a petting zoo admiring god''s creatures instead
    of viewing the killing of them. i have a policy of not interfering with my children
    in their marriages or how they raise their children. however, if needed, i am
    always available for advice if asked. although i have shared my opinion that teddy
    is too young, it has fallen on deaf ears. at age 4, my grandson is too immature
    to understand the killing. i don''t believe that this exposure is good for his
    psychological development at his tender age. how do i approach my son-in-law about
    this, and at what age do you think it is appropriate to allow the boy to go hunting?

    my family is protesting a request i have made regarding the birth of my first
    child. i would prefer that my husband and i be alone with our newborn for at least
    the first 24 hours after the baby is born. i would like to contact my family the
    day after to invite them to the hospital. both our families can be very loud,
    as i witnessed firsthand last week when my sister-in-law had her first child.
    there were at least 20 relatives in her room after her c-section. it became so
    loud at one point that the nurse had to ask everyone to either leave the room
    or keep their voices at a moderate level. i also saw how overbearing my mother
    was with my sister when she had her son several years ago. mom says i''m "taking
    this experience away" from her, but i don''t think it''s her experience. it''s
    my husband''s and my experience. i truly feel it will be more peaceful if it''s
    just my husband, me and our baby that first day. my husband has agreed to go along
    with whatever i request, but i know he''d prefer his family be present. your thoughts,
    please? -- no visitors in louisiana'

    my husband and i have been married five years. my husband''s stepdad died two
    years ago. after the funeral we offered to have his mother come live with us until
    she got back on her feet. well, it has been two years, and she''s still here.
    she doesn''t help out with the expenses, although she is able to, and has made
    no plans to move. we have raised the subject, but she says that she''s in the
    midst of writing a book and wants to see if it will sell before she decides what
    to do. she''s constantly in the house and goes nowhere on her own. my husband
    and i are her only form of entertainment. on top of that, we''re expecting our
    first child. i wanted my husband and i and our baby to bond as a family before
    anyone else was in the picture, but that''s not going to happen now. am i selfish
    to want to be alone with my husband and baby? how can we make her see that she
    has overstayed her welcome? fear of being alone is what''s stopping her from leaving.
    but she can''t expect to live here indefinitely. this has put a strain on our
    marriage. my husband agrees with me, but we see no way out of this situation.
    we want his mom to be ok, so we don''t have the heart to kick her out. but isn''t
    it time for her to stand on her own? our marriage is being destroyed because of
    this, and we''re desperate for guidance. -- hopeless down south'

    our youngest son, "devin," is 15. he has been seeing a girl i''ll call "allison"
    for five months. allison''s parents allow them to hang out at their house with
    parental supervision. devin has come home twice with hickeys, and once with permanent

    expensive, and i doubted she could afford it. this was over a year ago, and the
    problems started right away. after the most recent occurrence, i finally went
    ballistic even though the items andy stole cost only 33 cents. i have had it!
    when andy is confronted, he always says someone else did it (i have children of
    my own), that someone gave it to him (which has never been the case), "it was
    an accident" or "it was already like that" (half the time either my husband or
    i had seen him break the item). andy has never admitted what he has done or said
    he was sorry. i finally informed mary that i''m no longer available to watch her
    son due to his outrageous behavior, and i never want him in my house again. i
    haven''t spoken to my sister in months. i see no future for andy except prison.

    what should a person do when he or she works with a pathological liar? this woman

    even tells people that she''s a lawyer when she''s really a secretary, and tells

    our divorced daughter has been dating "brian," a man she met online, for a little
    over a year. my husband and i are concerned about the behavior of our 13-year-old
    granddaughter, "lolita," toward him. lolita is naive in many ways and unaware
    of the pitfalls she may encounter. she''s constantly sitting on brian''s lap,
    hugging him, or talking to him in very close proximity. we feel that our daughter
    should have a talk with lolita and explain that a "young woman" who is rapidly
    developing should not act this way with a man who is not her father. failing that,
    we feel that, as the adult, brian should discourage it -- which we haven''t seen
    him do. on a trip to the beach a few months ago, their "play" in the ocean looked
    more like a couple than a girl with a potential stepdad. our daughter also has
    an 8-year-old girl to whom brian does not show the same kind of attention. i don''t
    want to make unwarranted accusations about something that may be entirely innocent.
    it could seriously jeopardize our relationship with our daughter. do we have a

    your advice to "considering it in san mateo" (nov. 26), who asked you if it was
    permissible to have an affair because his wife of 34 years no longer wanted to
    have sex, was good, but you missed a couple of important points. how is that man''s
    hygiene? does he bathe every day? is he kind, loving and considerate of his wife
    during the day? are her hormones imbalanced? is she depressed or anemic? before
    "considering it" goes jumping at another opportunity, he might want to consider
    showing affection and concern to the woman who has been with him for so long.

    her to see her physician and her gynecologist. if she refuses, he should contact

    the writer''s wife may have a medical condition such as high cholesterol or high

    which affects interest in sex. menopause can also cause significantly reduced
    sex drive. some hormone replacement medicines may help with this. these conditions
    can be evaluated and treated by her doctor or ob/gyn. the man should also evaluate
    the way he treats his wife. men often remind their wives that they desire sex,

    my husband and i have been going round and round about nursing homes. my father''s

    is not for those families who can afford to pay for someone to care for a patient
    in his or her own home. nor does it apply to those who can afford an assisted-living
    facility. when is it the "best-case scenario" for someone''s continued care to
    be provided by a nursing home? or should the parent be allowed to remain at home
    despite the consequences? is it more compassionate to prolong his or her life
    in an environment that he or she would never have chosen or agreed to, or is it
    irresponsible to honor his or her wishes to live alone, with limited assistance,
    even though it may lead to an early death? my father''s care is far too complex
    and time-consuming for me or any other family member to take on in our own homes.

    i recently let a friend borrow a bracelet of mine. i left it at her house and
    asked that she return it the next time we saw each other. that was sunday morning,
    and i even called ahead of time to make sure she remembered. when we met, she
    told me she had forgotten to bring it. a few days later i was at her house again.
    when she gave me the bracelet, it had been completely destroyed by her cat. she
    apologized and said she''d replace it. i said it was ok, and then asked if she
    would really buy me a new one. "no," she replied, "my cat did it, not me." i decided
    not to push the issue. the bracelet wasn''t too expensive, but i feel i deserve
    some sort of payment because the cat didn''t know any better. what should i do?

    alienated and lonely. also, he stays in a job he claims he hates because he can''t
    afford to miss one payment to his estranged wife. dave refuses to get a divorce

    i had always looked up to her. the news was devastating. equally devastating is

    there was only a narrow pathway to her bedroom. a couple of space heaters were

    i have been faithfully married for more than 20 years. my wife and i are known
    as the "cute couple" who still hold hands in public, take time to play together,
    and never say a negative word about each other in public. my son, who has just
    turned 19, wants to marry somebody "just like mom," whom he views as the world''s
    greatest wife and mother. he''s making good on this and has begun getting serious
    with a young woman who is much like his mother in many crucial ways. at this point,
    how do i tell my son that the biggest mistake of my life was marrying his mother,

    late? the girl he is dating shows the same severe anxiety disorders as my wife,
    and manipulates him through learned helplessness and (presumably) the same psychosomatic
    chronic illnesses. she displays the severe mood swings that have made my wife
    completely ineffectual as a mother and companion. my wife''s disorders completely
    dominate our lives, as she refuses any therapy. i have had no choice but to surrender
    and make do, abandoning a wonderful career -- ph.d. from a top business school,

    poverty, hating my life and longing for the freedom that will come from one or

    to be as supportive as possible and never undercut her position in her eyes or

    and we have mutual friends. there has been some discussion about going on a date,
    but so far nothing has transpired. the problem, as my daughter sees it, is that
    he''s 16 years younger than i am and one year older than she is. she''s upset
    by the age difference and says it is "disturbing." my fiance died suddenly two
    years ago, and i have only recently begun dating again. i asked her to be happy
    for me. she responded that she thinks it''s great that i''m pretty enough and
    in good enough shape to attract a 25-year-old, but it''s "not right." i love my
    daughter, but i don''t want to live my life to make her happy anymore. she''s
    an adult. neither of my kids lives at home. i see them about once a month or so.
    my daughter has discussed this with her friends, who all side with her. because
    i work with men, i threw the ball into their court. they all said, "great! go
    for it!" why can''t my daughter be happy for me? she would rather i date someone
    in his 40s -- and i would, if i met someone who showed any interest. my profession
    is a difficult one for the average man to accept. they don''t like the fact that

    deceased. he sometimes receives invitations to weddings, parties, etc. addressed
    only to him. without consulting me, he will call and tell these people that if
    i am not invited, then he will not attend -- so they are forced to tell him it''s
    ok if i come, too. i am very uncomfortable about these situations. i feel that
    after 10 years my name, or at least "and guest," should appear on the invitation
    or i should not go. because i don''t want him to stay home, i usually end up going.
    what do you think about this? -- uncomfortable in wisconsin'

    i have only recently realized how unhappy my parents'' marriage is. on the way
    home from a concert one night, my mom started crying and said how much she wanted
    to be with a man who could stay awake throughout a performance. then she told
    me i should never get married. she said people "always grow apart." she has been
    saying it repeatedly over the last few weeks and has even had some of her friends
    tell me the same thing. i began asking other people about it, and they all act
    like they''re not happy in their marriages, either. i am now genuinely afraid
    to get married. i am 18 and have just started dating a man you would consider
    marriage material. but i''m holding back my feelings because i''m afraid one day
    he might propose. is "happily ever after" achievable anymore in a marriage? --

    a former professor of mine was a good friend and very supportive last year when
    i was experiencing some personal difficulties. recently i have heard that he has
    not been acting like himself. i was told he has developed a bad attitude, curses
    in class, and uses his degree to demean his students'' opinions on topics. one
    of his current students told me he''s surprised the professor hasn''t been thrown
    out of class for his behavior. this is not the same professor who helped me last
    year. it seems like his evil twin. i suspect he may be having some personal problems.
    because of our previous professor/student relationship, i don''t think i can get
    involved. however, because of the help he gave me when i needed it, i care and
    would like to offer support. is there anything i can do? i want my friend back.

    a friend forwarded me an item she had read on the internet. i have learned a lot
    during my 38 years of living, and think these important life lessons might be
    something you''d like to pass along to your many readers. 1. respect others, even
    if they don''t respect you. later in life they may remember that respect. 2. love
    with your whole heart. it may be broken, but you can''t say that you never loved.
    3. treat animals with kindness, and it will be repaid to you a hundredfold. 4.
    be honest with the people you love. honesty really is the best policy. 5. admit
    your mistakes; it shows you are human. 6. learn from your mistakes, but don''t
    dwell on them. negative thinking will only make you depressed -- and that''s not
    good for you or those around you. 7. tell your family often that you love them.
    you never know when it will be the last time you get to say it. 8. never tell
    others that their dreams are stupid or dumb. each of us is entitled to our dreams.
    who are we to say they won''t come true? 9. realize that the only person you can
    change is yourself. 10. be thankful for everything you have. knowing you are blessed
    isn''t arrogant or cocky if you''re truly thankful for your blessings. -- jennifer

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    it''s that time of year again when parents take their kids to see santa. as a
    professional santa''s helper for many years, may i offer some suggestions? let
    your children approach santa on their own. do not force your child to sit on santa''s
    lap. santa has been seen in books and on tv, but he is now real, big and loud.
    that can be scary to a child. if he or she wants to stand at a distance and talk
    to santa, that is ok. sometimes just holding the child and standing next to santa
    is all it takes for a child to warm up to the idea of sitting on his lap. if your
    little one is upset and you want a picture with santa, have someone else snap
    the photo while you stand by your child. let santa talk to your children while
    you hold their hands. santa (if any good) will pace the visit and stop it if it''s
    taking too long. if children are afraid, do not let santa grab at them to put
    them on his lap. that will only make the problem worse. i hope this helps to make
    the visit easier. -- santa''s helper in central illinois'

    for the first time in eight years, my husband and i will be staying in a hotel
    when we visit his parents for christmas. while i love his family, their home is
    small, and we are relegated to a trundle bed and must share the sole bathroom
    with the entire family. it''s impossible for us to be comfortable with so many
    people in such close quarters. we assumed that sleeping in a nearby hotel and
    visiting during the days and evenings would be a fair compromise. we were shocked
    at their reaction when we discussed our plans with the family. they are very hurt
    about our decision and extremely offended. they are begging us to reconsider and
    stay in their home. are our actions selfish and cold-hearted? we mean no harm,
    and are so surprised at the strong reaction that we''re starting to question our

    i am nearly 50, and learned when i was in my early 30s that i was adopted. i became
    engaged to a man my adoptive mother did not like. when i told her the news, her
    response was, "do what you want -- you aren''t ours anyway!" i was devastated.
    i didn''t realize it was literally true until years later, when several of my
    cousins confirmed it. since then, i have located my birth family, although my
    birth mother died long ago. i asked my adoptive mother (who was and still is "mom"
    to me) to please send me all the documents she had relating to the adoption, as
    well as some letters she mentioned that my birth mother had sent in later years
    saying she was thinking about me and hoping i was well. mom told me she had thrown
    them all out! i was devastated all over again. mom says i''m overly sensitive,
    that the papers were worthless trash and were hers to dispose of. over the years
    she had promised several times to show them to me but never did. now she claims
    i knew all along that i was adopted and just wanted to find a better mom. abby,

    i am an adult now, but i was once that child. grades came easily to me, and sometimes
    other kids made fun of me for being so smart. i purposely missed answers on tests
    at times to avoid getting a perfect score and being teased. i wanted to fit in.
    i learned early that intelligence was not something to be prized. when i was older
    and began dating, i remember my mom telling me boys didn''t like girls who were
    smarter or who beat them at sports or games. so i began hiding the gifts and talents
    god had blessed me with. i married young to a man who was intimidated by my intelligence,
    so i hid it away piece by piece until even i began to doubt my capabilities. then
    one day something happened that changed everything. i was granted another gift
    -- a daughter who was blessed with a beautifully intelligent mind and reminded
    me of myself as a child. i saw her watch my every step and try to be like me.
    it was then that i realized i had to own and embrace my intelligence or she would
    hide hers and allow others to steal it away piece by piece. abby, it was life-changing.
    it has caused difficulties in my marriage because i suddenly changed the rules
    of the game, and i no longer allow myself to be less so that someone else can
    be more -- but that change needed to happen. may i share with "smart seventh-grader"
    some of what i have shared with my daughter? never hide your god-given talents
    to make someone else feel better. when people tease you about being smart, they''re
    showing their own insecurity. don''t be afraid to answer questions, but don''t
    "show off." life is a balance. embrace your intelligence and view it as the gift
    it is. if you let it shine, it will take you far. -- older and wiser in indiana'

    i recently inherited some money. the amount is enough to allow me to leave a job
    i find stifling and set up my own business without having to worry about money
    for the first year. i am excited about it, but i''m getting nothing but doom and
    disapproval from my family. my husband says he supports me, but has confided that
    he''s afraid i''m going to plunge us into poverty. my parents and siblings tell
    me i''m being irresponsible and wasting money i could be investing for retirement.
    they remind me of how many small businesses fail and tell me i''m "crazy" to leave

    i am 30 and have been dating my girlfriend, "megan," for a few months. she''s
    22. i''m in love with her, but i can''t seem to get something out of my head.
    megan told me she is bisexual. she says she has never been with a woman, but she''s
    attracted to them. i was in this situation before. my last girlfriend left me
    for another woman, and i''m afraid it''ll happen again. i love megan and would

    she missed out on something and want to pursue other options. megan swears she

    i have been married to "mick" for 22 years -- most of them happy. my problem is
    his communication skills. i have always had a hard time contacting him. he has
    a cell phone, but won''t take it out of his vehicle. recently, our daughter came
    home from college. we had planned to go to dinner with her and her boyfriend.
    when mick didn''t show up, i tried without success to contact him. my daughter
    tried and then my son did, too. this went on for an hour and a half. we were worried
    sick, so we started calling his friends and co-workers -- anyone who might know
    his whereabouts. abby, i have a serious heart condition that could send me to
    the hospital at any time. mick finally called back and said he had gotten distracted
    talking with an old friend. he acted like we were crazy for being concerned, and
    insists he did nothing wrong. all i have ever asked is that my husband and kids
    give me a quick call to let me know if they''re going to be late so i won''t worry.
    my son and daughter do it, but mick refuses. he says he''s the breadwinner, and
    he should not have to answer to anyone. i have put up with this for years, but
    now i have had enough. what do you think? -- sick and tired of it, in south carolina'

    for 20 years i have gone to considerable thought and expense to carefully select
    nice holiday cards to send to a varied client base. i have tried to be considerate
    and sensitive to any cultural and religious differences. my christian friends
    wanted explicitly religious cards, the hanukkah cards were not religious enough,
    and the middle-of-the-road "season''s greetings" were termed "wishy-washy secular."
    my own family is a feuding stew of different faiths. this year? i''ve had it.
    i sent thanksgiving cards with the following quote from theodore roosevelt: "let
    us remember that as much has been given us, much will be expected from us, and
    that true homage comes from the heart as well as from the lips, and shows itself
    in deeds." it bothers me that a simple delivery of good wishes was met with such
    a resounding show of bad manners and ill will, and i see no point in continuing.

    left her on the side of the road and brought the cat home. the cat would have
    provided him with unconditional love, something it appears loretta is incapable
    of feeling. what she did shows she doesn''t value her relationship with her grandchildren.

    my husband and i have been married for many years. we have three happy, successful
    children and a good life together. i love him dearly. i recently discovered that
    he had been spending a lot of time in erotic online chat rooms. he had hundreds
    of contacts he was speaking with regularly for pleasure. it had escalated to the
    point that he would have "conversations" with them on the phone or watch them
    on a webcam. after i caught him, he promised to stop. i caught him again and threatened
    to leave him. he swore that he had never met any of these people and that he had
    used a fictitious name. he''s now getting counseling and expects me to get beyond
    it. i am trying, but i feel betrayed. i feel as though he was unfaithful. i am
    sure you have other readers out there who have experienced internet infidelity.
    do you consider it cheating if they never actually physically meet the people
    they talk to? i have no one to discuss this with and would appreciate some input.

    how do you handle someone who needs to constantly flaunt his money? that person
    is my boss. he makes a lot of money, and he enjoys rubbing it in my face. he never
    fails to tell me how much he pays for purchases -- from cars to clothing, even
    to how much he paid for his mother''s funeral. he literally approaches my desk
    with his checkbook open and points out the amount. this man spends more on clothes
    in a month than i earn in a year. he takes his cash out of his pocket and counts
    it in front of me. i feel like he''s waiting for some kind of reaction from me,
    but i don''t give in. can you think of a way for me to stop him in his tracks

    my parents divorced when i was 15. it was nasty. my mother, in an act of desperation,
    dragged me into it. i was placed in foster care until her allegations were looked
    into and found to be false. i held a grudge for 10 years. during that time i was
    bitter, angry, shy, anxious, scared -- overall, just a mess. i finally realized
    that until i addressed those feelings, it would affect all aspects of my life.
    at 25, i am finally trying to have a relationship with my mother. it has been
    hard. there are some things from the past that i cannot forget, and i find it
    difficult to let go of my anger and resentment. i''d like to write a book about
    my experience as a guide to forgiving and moving on, but if i do, i would not
    be able to hide my identity or my mother''s. is it realistic to write a self-help

    a year ago, my boss was diagnosed with cancer. she had major surgery and a round
    of radiation therapy. last week, her doctor discovered a mass, and after biopsy,
    she may be going in for more surgery. i am finding it difficult to show much empathy
    for my boss. despite having had the disease she continues to live an unhealthy
    lifestyle. she still smokes, has a couple of drinks a day and eats a lot of red
    meat. i don''t drink or smoke and i''m a vegetarian, so i can''t understand why
    a person would risk her health by doing these things. we have received several
    newsletters at work from our insurance provider on how to prevent cancer, but

    and said, "it''s your own fault," but it''s frustrating to listen to her problems
