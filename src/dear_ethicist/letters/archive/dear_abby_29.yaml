    my daughter, "heidi," is 17 and pregnant. she is going to an alternative high
    school and doing well. my daughter is proactive about her pregnancy and excited
    about the new baby. this will be my first grandchild, and i am excited too. my
    problem is, when i express my joy, others act like i am crazy for being happy.
    at a baptism in church, i told my husband how happy i will be when our grandson
    is baptized and that i can''t wait until he''s born. he responded that he is not
    excited at all because of the expense and upheaval this new addition will cause.
    i know there will be hardships with a new baby. we don''t have much room in our
    house, and a new member will bring some burden. i do not have my head in the clouds
    -- but when i see the ultrasound image and hear that heartbeat, i am filled with
    joy. am i wrong to be happy? and if not, what can i say to people who tell me
    i am? -- proud almost-grandma'

    i am almost 40 and single -- no children. my friend, "amanda," is in her 20s.
    she has two beautiful children, ages 6 and 2, and spoils them with an overabundance
    of toys and by giving them whatever they want. i wouldn''t interfere, but "giving
    them what they want" includes allowing them to ride in her vehicle without wearing
    a safety belt or child restraints. i love amanda and her children dearly. they
    wear their safety belts when they are with me. i''m afraid their mother will get
    into an accident and one of the children will be severely injured or die. how
    can i convince amanda to keep her children safely restrained when traveling without
    coming across as a "know-it-all"? i don''t want to alienate her, but i want her
    kids to be safe. -- caring friend, moberly, mo.'

    my husband, "mike," and i have been married for 18 years, but for the last few
    we have been growing apart. mike has recently expressed a desire to quit work
    and sail around the world. he bought an expensive sailboat, took lessons, and
    is teaching our kids to sail. i tried it, but i''m afraid of the water. i have,
    however, been supportive of my husband''s dream. i knew mike was looking for a
    "crew" for the boat because he couldn''t sail with just the kids. today he told
    me he has found someone. this crew consists of a married woman and her two kids.
    mike invited her to crew after she first asked her husband. he did not ask me
    first. he simply announced he had found a competent sailor. i expressed vehemently
    that i am against this. i have never met the woman or her kids, and i''m hurt
    that i wasn''t consulted. mike says he is hurt because i "don''t trust him." by

    three cheers to joe and to you for your answer regarding his wearing skirts. while
    skirts may not be appropriate for riding a horse or motorcycle riding, they make
    perfect sense as casual attire, potentially even business attire. i find it interesting
    that women have won the "right" to wear pants at will, and their sexuality is
    not questioned. however, when a man dons a skirt, his masculinity falls under
    suspicion, unless he''s wearing a kilt and is involved in macho activities. then

    that question is, "do you ask that of women wearing skirts?" -- ray in california'

    i am the "other woman." i never in a million years thought i''d be in this position.
    i had been divorced for several years. i should have run the other way once i
    learned that my lover was married, but i was lonely. i wanted to feel like a woman
    again -- someone a man found attractive and would like to spend time with. some
    things i have come to understand as the other woman: if husbands and wives treated
    each other as well as they do their best friends, there would be fewer affairs
    and cheating spouses. i don''t consider myself a "mistress." there is no exchange
    of money, cars, jewels, furs and no condo or apartment for my use. nor am i a
    home wrecker -- my lover''s marriage is still intact. what do i get? a wonderful
    lover, best friend and someone who helps me out around my home. we give each other
    our undivided attention when we''re together. we make the most of every opportunity
    we have to enjoy each other''s company. i can''t imagine life without him. we
    please and give to each other during our lovemaking. i believe we came into each
    other''s lives for a reason. please advise men and women to love each other even
    when it hurts. don''t let issues fester into sores. make love with your spouse
    even if it''s not your cup of tea. sex is a glue that can keep your marriage together.
    this connection brings a closeness words cannot describe. don''t lose that with
    your spouse. you''ll long to have it back one day. the other woman is not evil,
    a tramp or a whore. you could be her one day. she''s just someone who is as lonely
    as the man is. tell wives to protect their marriage, to swallow their pride, admit
    there are issues that need resolving and work through them. and one more thing:

    it takes a lot for me to write, but i felt your response to "quarters from heaven"
    (dec. 20) was unfeeling. i would imagine the smoke odor from her now-dead friend
    was fleeting. she didn''t need a new room. the quarters, too, were a special reminder.
    after my father died, i kept finding pennies and nickels for several months. my
    late husband, jim, used the smell of coffee to let us know his spirit was close.
    i have been awakened twice at 2 or 3 a.m., and the third time it was 6 a.m. i
    was visiting friends at a lake house he loved and awoke to the strong smell of
    coffee. i went downstairs and said, "i had to get up. i could smell the coffee."
    my hostess replied, "i haven''t started it yet." i said, "oh, that jim -- he''s
    doing it to me again." my son has a shed in the backyard that jim helped build.
    he and his 8-year-old son were going out there and the boy said, "i smell coffee."
    my son said, "i do, too." they went back inside to tell his wife, and she said,
    "don''t you know your dad always had a cup of coffee he bought on the way here
    when he came to work on the shed?" when they went back out, the smell was gone.
    there has also been a distinct scent of lavender a few times in our bedroom --
    and this morning i smelled oatmeal for a few minutes. he liked to cook it, and
    i never do. jim has been gone almost three years, and these reminders are on an
    occasional basis. it is their way of communicating. -- barbara in whitesboro,

    i am living with a great guy. "phil" is a sweetheart. he has two nice kids, a
    good job and we are talking about marriage. we travel, have fun and i have never

    depressing and uncooperative. i suppose much of it is his father''s and my fault.
    phil does not want danny to move in after graduation. he feels the decision is
    not about choosing between him and my son, but about choosing between my son and
    me. i can envision a wonderful future with phil, but i can''t imagine telling
    my son that he is on his own. my heart tells me i''m a mother first and must provide

    my husband, "dwight," was very ill a few years ago. some wonderful folks held
    a fundraiser to help us with bills and unpaid leave. we paid all of the outstanding
    medical bills and living expenses with a large portion of the money; the remainder
    has been set aside for an organ transplant dwight will need a few years down the
    road. we are extremely grateful to everyone who put forth the time and effort,
    as well as those who donated money. dwight is now in remission, and we are both
    back to our full-time jobs. over the last three years, the only time we have taken
    for ourselves is a couple of long weekends. our home is old and we''ve had to
    replace some windows and do some minor repairs. our car is 10 years old and still
    runs fine, but eventually we will have to buy another one. i''m afraid that people
    who helped us may think we are squandering their gift if we take a vacation or
    buy a car. even when we repaired our home, we felt guilty. my husband is healthy
    right now, and we would like to enjoy ourselves before things change again. the

    my best friend from childhood, "ethan," whom i have known for 25 years, is being
    married. i''m a girl, and my parents weren''t thrilled that my best friend was
    a guy, but they eventually accepted him as part of the family. ethan and i were
    very close. it hurt that we were separated by quite a distance during college
    and afterward. but we have always maintained an active e-mail correspondence.
    during the last two years i have hardly heard from him, and he has ignored several
    attempts i have made at getting together. we now live only a couple of hours apart,
    and i often visit his city to see relatives. i thought maybe we had just grown
    apart, but two weeks ago i received an invitation to ethan''s wedding. i had no
    idea he was even engaged! i was thrilled to hear from him and happy for him. i
    e-mailed him three times but received no response. instead, ethan''s brother responded.
    is it expecting too much for him to respond personally? i miss him terribly and
    i''d love to go, but i''m feeling like he doesn''t care. i met ethan''s girlfriend
    years ago, and she was very sweet. i don''t think jealously plays a part in this.

    is it possible -- or normal -- for someone to lack the desire to travel? i am
    a 23-year-old female college graduate with a good job. i am involved in a serious
    relationship and still live with my parents because of financial constraints.
    i like to think my life is pretty normal. when my friends graduated from college,
    they all backpacked through europe before starting their jobs. i was content to
    stay home, relax and readjust to life off-campus. now that my friends are accruing
    vacation time, they are planning all sorts of trips -- cruises, vacations, road
    trips to visit old roommates, etc. none of this appeals to me. i am a nervous
    traveler and tend to feel uncomfortable when i''m outside my "comfort zone." i''m
    not afraid to admit that i can be uptight, and i don''t "roll with the punches"
    very well. last summer my boyfriend and i spent several weekends in a beach town
    about two hours away. i had a great time, although i was just as happy to go home
    at the end. i am not depressed or aloof. give me an afternoon at the local mall
    or a movie rather than a weekend in las vegas. am i weird? -- homebody in massachusetts'

    my boyfriend of 10 years, "simon," comes from a broken home. his mother left when
    he was quite young and as a result, his food choices are horrible. simon is 30

    food. he includes absolutely no vegetables or lean protein in his diet. i love
    my boyfriend and can''t imagine spending my life with anyone else. i have tried

    i am a 29-year-old woman who lost my beloved mother a few months ago. a sudden

    i have tried to have cordial relations with my neighbors, but do not have particularly
    close friendships with any of them. a little over a year ago, a young man started
    coming to my home on a regular basis whenever my wife was out of town. after a
    while, he began spending the night with me when she was away. evidently, some
    of my neighbors noticed these visits and started gossiping about it, spreading
    the rumor that i am gay and that this young guy is my lover. more recently, however,
    he has spent the night when my wife is present, so now my neighbors think something
    kinky is going on. at times i am puzzled by this. at other times i am angry at
    their arrogance and gall. the explanation is simple: the young man is my son from
    a previous relationship. because we were prevented from having contact when he
    was a child, we are now trying to establish a relationship -- and we are making
    progress. my wife and other children have been wonderfully supportive in all this.
    i really don''t want to tell my neighbors what''s going on because it will inevitably

    i''m 29, and my girlfriend, "mia," is 25. we have been in a committed relationship
    for 10 months. a few weeks into our relationship i noticed that every time mia
    was relaxing or riding in the car, she would suck her thumb. when she spends the
    night with me, she brings her baby blanket. mia used to be discreet about the
    thumb-sucking, but now she openly does it in front of my parents and our friends.
    she also sucks her thumb in front of her parents. from time to time they try to

    what people back home will say. (it''s a small town where everyone knows everything.)

    as exhibitionist. he flaunts his body on almost every occasion. when people are
    around, he goes into his room and emerges minutes later without his shirt, naked
    to the waist, with his pants dropping down almost showing places we do not wish
    to see. he struts around, going from room to room, all the while his pants slipping
    even lower. fletcher then usually changes into shorts, which also slide down and
    reveal more than the public should be viewing. fletcher does this whether it''s
    hot or cold, in the house or outside. his behavior is not normal. he seems to
    be doing this stripping thing more and more, regardless of where he is. at our
    house over the holidays, he found an excuse to remove his shirt to show his abs.

    i have never understood why girls would wear something that appears to violate
    all laws of comfort. the only way for me to solve this mystery was to try a thong.
    i purchased two and wore them exclusively for a couple of days. after the initial
    "getting used to," they were comfortable. in fact, i like them so much i bought
    a few more this evening. i am also thinking about buying other ladies'' underwear.

    my husband and i attended the wedding of two dear friends. the groom''s mother,
    "millie," made party favors for all the guests -- little gift bags containing
    sugar-coated almonds and, because the bride and groom are animal lovers, a small
    glass animal. a few days later, a friend brought her teenage daughter to our home.
    the daughter admired the two glass animals, so i gave them to her. i was shocked
    when, the following weekend, millie called and asked me to return them. she said
    she planned to take them back because she would prefer to use the money to buy
    the couple something they could use. feeling guilty for "regifting," i responded
    with the first thing that popped into my head, that i hoped i hadn''t "misplaced"
    them. millie said she hoped not, too -- they had cost $35 apiece, and she would
    expect us to reimburse her! further, we should not mention it to the "happy couple"
    because of the embarrassment it would cause. i asked the bride''s sister where
    millie might have bought the glass figurines under the guise of wanting to get
    some as gifts for my grad students. i was stunned when she responded that she
    had purchased an entire case of these inexpensive animals as wedding favors, and
    that i was welcome to them if i wanted to pick them up from her home. i''m unclear
    what motivated millie to ask for the animals to be returned, or why she would
    inflate the price and expect to be reimbursed. i understand there was an unpleasant
    power struggle over the wedding arrangements, but i''m not sure what she hopes
    to gain from this. how should this be handled? my husband says i should tell millie
    the truth, that we gave them away and we know they cost only 80 cents apiece.

    my husband has been joking recently about being a "closet case." there has always
    been somewhat of a question about that in the back of my mind. another ingredient
    to throw in is the fact that he is very controlling about everything, including
    sex -- which he withholds unless it''s his idea. so, is he a closet case or is
    he just a controlling person? -- unsure in irving, texas'

    my husband and i watch our 2-year-old granddaughter almost every weekend. she
    and her parents live about 60 miles from us. the problem is, we agreed when we
    started taking her that we would meet halfway. but for reasons unknown to me,
    we always have to drive a lot more than halfway. i have checked the mileage and
    pointed it out to my daughter and son-in-law, and they ignore it. this may seem

    my darling husband, "darren," and i are soul mates, yet he has asked me for a
    divorce. he says it''s not because he doesn''t love me, but because he does. abby,
    we may be facing bankruptcy. darren doesn''t want to drag me and my credit down.
    he doesn''t want to leave, and thinks that after we divorce our life can go on
    as it has been -- although on paper we''ll no longer be husband and wife. my first
    thought was, no! we are husband and wife. i meant "for richer or poorer." we''re
    in our 50s, and darren says he is looking out for my future. i am committed to
    my marriage and believe we''re in this financial situation together. i didn''t
    marry darren for his money, and i certainly don''t want to divorce him over money.
    darren swears this isn''t an excuse to get out of our marriage. he says we can
    be married again as soon as we''re back on our feet. am i wrong about this, abby?

    it is interesting that after saying terrible things to her friend, "perplexed"

    friendship. the apology was self-serving, given only to convince her friend not
    to dump her. why didn''t she call immediately after realizing that what she said
    was awful? in addition, her apology was in writing, instead of on the phone or

    i''m a 45-year-old male reader. i have been friends with "oscar" for 20 years.
    he asked me to be the godparent of his new baby girl. as you can imagine, i was
    overwhelmed when he asked. i have never been a godparent. we discussed it at length,
    and i told him i needed to think it over to be sure of my decision. after a few
    days i was still indecisive. part of me wanted to do it and part of me didn''t.
    i told oscar it was an honor, but that i felt unsure and not fully committed.
    i knew if i were to accept and then reconsider, it wouldn''t be cool. so i bowed
    out to give him time to find someone else. oscar''s reaction told me he was deeply
    angry and hurt. that night i hardly slept. i kept thinking how much i had disappointed
    my friend, his wife and their entire family. i feel terribly guilty. it''s clear

    from time to time you print letters about random acts of kindness. may i share

    kids to a restaurant for breakfast to celebrate our twins'' fourth birthday. when
    it was time to pay our bill, the waiter told us that a couple who had been sitting
    behind us had taken care of our tab. what that couple didn''t know was that the
    day before, my doctor had informed me a lump in my neck was probably lymphoma
    and that he needed to do a biopsy as soon as possible. he had wanted me to meet
    with a surgeon that morning, but i told him no. it was the twins'' birthday, and
    i didn''t want them to associate their birthday with the day mommy got sick. what
    that couple did was more than pay for our meal; it gave me hope. i felt it was
    a sign that everything would be "taken care of." to pay it forward, we left the
    waiter a large tip. i did end up with hodgkin''s disease, but i have been in remission

    i am writing about the letter from "turkey eater in texas" (nov. 12), who resented
    having a vegan thanksgiving to accommodate two family members. i think your answer
    missed what being a gracious host is about. the entire meal shouldn''t have to
    consist of vegan items. however, it wouldn''t be a big deal to serve a vegan main
    dish and have those individuals also bring their favorite items. making them bring
    a complete meal excludes them from a family gathering, and what fun is that? after
    your column ran, my father called to tell me that holiday dinners would no longer
    accommodate my daughter''s celiac disease. she''s 9 and struggles with being "different."
    when she ingests gluten, she has cramps and vomiting, loses weight and risks significant
    long-term consequences. next year, we will host the holiday dinners. our extended
    family can join us -- or not. the bottom line is that if you exclude family (for
    being vegan or having celiac disease), you''ve done the opposite of what holidays

    i am married for the second time and have two lovely stepsons in their early 20s.
    recently they told me that my sister "gloria" (age 55) had asked them to remove
    their shirts during a holiday event several years ago. they were teenagers at
    the time. she told them she wanted to "at least look since she couldn''t touch."
    after that, they no longer wanted to participate in family gatherings. for the
    record, gloria has a history of poor impulse control. she takes medication for
    it and also to control her temper. she would verbally bait the older boy, who
    would then antagonize her until i stopped him from playing a battle of wits with
    an unarmed person. my relationship with my sister has always been contentious.
    she used to beat me when i was a child. she was also controlling and tried to
    order everyone around. should i stop having family gatherings? should i ask other

    i have known my husband for eight years and have been married to him for three.
    he is a unique and funny man, but he does have a few annoying quirks. the biggest
    one, and the reason i''m writing to you, is his need to have music blaring in
    our car. it''s not just when we''re driving, but also when we''re going through
    drive-thru restaurants, banks and gas stations. gas stations are the worst because
    he turns the volume up even louder so he can hear it outside. not only is it painful
    to my ears, but it''s embarrassing. i have asked him a number of times to turn
    it down, but it just leads to arguments. can you help me talk to him before i

    five years ago, when my niece was 9, we came up with the idea of making christmas
    cards and sending them out to special friends and family members. we both work
    hard to make sure each is attractive and in good taste, and we handwrite a personal
    note inside. we also print on the back that the card was "handmade with love."
    this has become a tradition for the two of us, and the cards are quite beautiful.
    last year, after we sent them out, i received a card from a friend with a small
    check inside. the card read, "i''m sending you this check so you can afford to
    buy ''real cards'' next year." i was, to say the least, hurt and offended. i wondered
    if others felt similarly, so i asked around and was shocked to learn they, too,
    thought i was "cheap." although it cost more money and time to create each card,
    no one appreciated them. we won''t be making the cards this year, but how do i
    tell my niece why? i don''t want her feelings hurt, too. -- blue at christmas'

    i am a semi-retired professional man. my wife and i have an ongoing disagreement
    and would like the benefit or your wisdom. i was raised that when a man enters

    hat. it annoys me to see young men sit in a restaurant wearing baseball caps,
    cowboys hats or even stocking caps. my wife says times have changed -- recent

    there is no right or wrong age for common etiquette. i can overlook this behavior
    in a fast-food restaurant, but i also see it happening in nice establishments.

    i have a 3-year-old, muscular male american pit bull terrier. when i walk "petey,"
    i am often asked by young and old alike if they can pet my dog because of his
    good looks. while petey has never bitten anyone, i am not comfortable letting
    strangers pet him. the breed can be aggressive. i always reply to these requests
    with a "no" and a "thank you," after which i am invariably asked if my dog is
    mean. now, if there is a possibility that a dog is mean, why would someone ask
    to pet him in the first place? perhaps i''m overly sensitive, but it''s an annoying

    i''m 15, and my parents have fought constantly for years. dad is an alcoholic.
    i guess you could say i have kind of given up on him. i''m involved in many sports,

    game. dad has now left us. he still calls mom just about every day, and he stops
    by the house to "check up" on things about three times a week. mom forced me to
    send him a "happy birthday" text. she wants me to start talking to him again and
    to build a relationship with him, but i think he has missed out on too much of

    three people have helped me make lemonade out of life''s lemons -- a patient and
    talented therapist, a beloved pastor and you. after 50 years, here are my top
    10 dear abby lessons: 1. no one can "make" you unhappy. you have choices. 2. the
    healthiest way to cure depression? volunteer your hands and your heart. 3. the
    best advice for raising children? remember that you raise them to let them go.
    4. the best person with whom to discuss marital difficulties? your spouse. complaining
    to others may make you feel better for a day, but it will be at the expense of
    your marriage. 5. don''t "protect" those you love from the pain that will heal
    them. 6. never criticize without working toward a solution, particularly when
    it comes to politics. 7. never forget abuse nor tolerate it again, but do forgive
    the abuser. 8. what (and whom) you love is not shown through words but by where
    you devote your time, your energy and money. 9. you are what you eat, read and
    watch on tv. 10. life is linear. make every moment matter. -- a survivor in new

    at christmas, "santa" always fills my children''s stockings with a mix of fun,

    to write, my husband and i started the tradition of tucking packets of thank-you
    cards into their stockings. we explained that santa must have given them the cards
    so they would have stationery to write thank-you notes to family and friends for
    the gifts they had received. the cards are a wonderful reminder to my children
    that they need to express their gratitude to those who have spent time and money
    to buy and send them a gift. usually there are cards left over to cover thank-you
    notes at birthday time as well. unfortunately, these days, not enough people --

    are given. i believe parents should encourage children to do this as soon as they

    if we travel to see my parents, we must also travel to see his. this "equal" obsession

    both are vegan, and he insisted that all the dishes we brought be vegan! i did

    my wife recently attended her 35th high school reunion alone. her high school
    sweetheart was there, and they talked and exchanged e-mail addresses. as the night
    wore on, he started making advances and my wife rebuffed him somewhat rudely.
    three days later, she e-mailed him an apology and they started an eight-week exchange.
    i suspected something was wrong and checked her e-mails, where i discovered some
    pretty torrid messages and a dinner meeting being planned. when i confronted my
    wife, she denied everything -- until i gave her copies of the e-mails. she says
    they never met, but i say the intent was there. to me, this is the same as a physical

    i relocated to live with "zack," my boyfriend of one year. now that i''m here
    i''m afraid that i adore him more than i am adored. i''m not the clingy type,
    but zack never cuddles. sex is not discussed -- and never "my" way. most things
    are like that. he isn''t abusive -- just uncompromising, lazy and selfish. to
    make matters worse, we share the house with a family member of his who has the
    same spoiled teenager attitude. i''m the one who cooks, cleans, shovels snow,
    takes care of the dog and has the guts to call the landlord about issues. i have
    asked zack to help and to ask for help from his relative. he excuses his relative
    from responsibility and will help me with that one request -- at that moment only.
    they have no regular chores. i experimented with the bathroom wastebasket -- it
    overflowed for weeks because i didn''t empty it. i am growing resentful and angry.
    if i say anything, zack rolls his eyes at me like i''m an idiot and asks me how
    i come up with all the "stuff" i gripe about. i feel like i''m the parent of two
    teenagers with overdeveloped ideas of entitlement, even though we all have an
    equal stake in this house. is there a different approach i can use, or should

    the number of teens and children who engage in inappropriate sexting and texting
    is shocking. these behaviors can be evidence of sexual exploitation, harassment,
    bullying and teen dating violence. the results of this teenage behavior can be
    devastating and have lifetime consequences. kids sometimes are afraid to go to
    parents or other responsible adults to seek help when they need it; often kids
    may not even know they are in trouble or exposing themselves to danger by their
    behavior. how long do you think it takes a "sext" between a girl and her boyfriend
    to make it to a child porn website? a cell phone is a computer, and parents are
    responsible for ensuring the safety of their children and protecting them from
    predators and others who might harm them. if "grief" is not engaging in inappropriate
    behavior, she shouldn''t be embarrassed if her parents read the text messages.
    abby, please use your column to help educate children, teens and their parents

    he has received contain glaring mistakes. they are all from college professors

    letter omitted an important word in a sentence, another misused a common word,
    and the third refers to lance as "ms." i told lance the letters do not reflect
    negatively on him because he didn''t write them. but he thinks they will give
    the impression he associates with sub-par representatives of the field. he refuses

    has had pork, beef or fowl for more than 10 years. we were at a barbecue at a

    burgers especially for us. another guest at the party asked me if i''d be as good-natured
    as our hosts if i were to have a get-together at my house. (in other words, would
    i serve meat to our carnivorous guests.) i told him no, to which he (jokingly?)
    replied that i was "selfish." abby, the idea of eating meat is gross to me now.

    being with someone with implants. i should have dumped him then, but i didn''t.

    aren''t you aware that the vast majority of females prefer taller men? "heightism"
    is a rampant and virulent prejudice. even if a guy is an inch or two taller than
    the woman, he will be considered too short if he isn''t taller than she is when
    she''s wearing heels. women go gaga over the really tall guys. i can''t count
    the number of times i''ve heard them brag about how tall their man happens to

    late as 10 p.m. i have a sensitive stomach and i need to eat early. i have eaten

    a full stomach with no problem. i get acid reflux. brian expects our guests to
    adhere to his routine. even when we have cookouts, everyone must wait for the
    entree. he says, "well, they''ll just have to wait. i don''t want anyone to eat
    and run." i put out appetizers, but it''s not enough to hold them. if we don''t
    wait, he gets angry and threatens not to have another cookout. i have explained

    glen already takes medications for several conditions. i, on the other hand, have

    sick. it''s not that i think he''s faking; i just think he needs to "get over

    him, make chicken soup, let him rest, pick up his medicine or whatever. but i''m

    i love him dearly, but i don''t seem to be able to work up sympathy when he (or

    with having pets. also the apartment is too cramped to accommodate them. my son
    "toby" is 2. he loved each of the animals. he''d watch the dog run around, pet
    the cat and stare at the fish. the cat slept in toby''s nursery, the dog guarded
    him in his stroller, and the fish loved him because he fed them. how can i encourage
    my son''s natural love of animals? a few hours playing with a cat or dog would
    be fine. -- petless in maryland'

    you told "no ink in louisville" (aug. 24) that her friend cared more about getting
    a tattoo than the feelings of the bride-to-be, and her "little sister" should
    have postponed getting one until after the wedding. i think "no ink" was insensitive
    on several counts. if she truly loves her dear friend, why couldn''t she simply
    accept her friend''s wish to wear a tattoo at the wedding? shouldn''t the love
    and acceptance of her friend come first? we are talking about true friendship.
    should body appearance be so important to the bride that she thinks the tattoo
    will ruin her wedding or the photographs? friendship works both ways. i think
    both women were insensitive in their regard for each other, but this was an opportunity
    for the bride-to-be to show her maturity. i see this as simply another case of
    how consumed we are as a society by appearance. come on! it''s only a tattoo.

    my son, "jason," is a 17-year-old high school senior honor student. my wife and
    i have managed to establish a fairly open relationship with our children; we encourage
    honesty and have attempted to establish mutual respect. recently, jason asked
    if he could have seven or eight friends over to drink. my wife, reasoning that
    if teenagers are going to indulge in alcohol, it''s better for them to do it in
    a safe, controlled environment, said yes. i, on the other hand, said no, based
    on the fact that the parents of the other teens would not approve. jason admitted
    that was, in fact, the case. while i agree with my wife''s reasoning, i refuse
    to allow my house to become the place where teens can gather to drink without
    their parents'' knowledge. jason is now upset with me, and i''m afraid he may

    invitations because he doesn''t know the people well. he uses work as an excuse.
    although he is required to work on weekends, it still infuriates me. it''s humiliating
    going to these family events alone, while people ask why joe isn''t there. i could
    give the "work" excuse, but i''m sure they''ll find it hard to swallow that he
    can never get off. i''m worried that when we''re married my family won''t show
    up because he pulls this. i have told him if he doesn''t change i will need to
    reconsider our relationship. giving me a few days out of the year shouldn''t be

    a young family member, "missy," age 18, has been doing nude centerfolds for almost
    a year. her mother signed the approval paperwork for her because missy was still
    17 at the time of the first photo shoot. since then, there have been many more
    photos and nude videos. missy''s grandparents practically raised her and don''t
    know about what she''s doing. the rest of the family is aware of it. her mother
    says it''s missy''s responsibility to tell her grandparents. the rest of the family
    would prefer the mother tell them. we all realize we have been part of this conspiracy.
    when our parents find out and realize that everyone else knew, they will feel
    betrayed. i''m afraid this will tear the family apart. missy has shared all this
    with her high school friends and others, so it may just be a matter of time before
    the grandparents hear about it. is there a way to keep the family from falling

    except my mother, who is still alive and living in the same town where she and

    i have been a social worker in two skilled nursing homes for the past six years.
    i often hear visitors approach patients with dementia and say, "do you know who
    i am?" or "do you know who this is?" it''s like giving the person with dementia
    a test, one which the person will often fail. it would be more effective to approach
    the person and say, "it is so nice to see you. i am (whomever) and knew you (in
    whatever circumstances)." persons with dementia do not need to be reminded that
    they don''t recall something. most of them know it. even relatives -- brothers,
    sisters, sons and daughters -- may need to introduce themselves to their loved
    ones. rather than giving the person with dementia a test when you visit, set up
    the visit to succeed by making simple introductions. remember, people who have
    dementia can remember things that happened a long time ago, but they may not recall
    what happened in the last five minutes. visitors should talk about the "good old
    days" and everyone will experience a good visit. -- p.b. in north carolina'

    about a year ago i was in the process of separating from my husband. i started
    looking for a place of my own, but after i found one, my husband said he wanted
    to "work things out." while we were separated we slept in different rooms. during
    this time i met another man, "craig." he knew i was married and i told him about
    the situation with my husband. craig and i have not been intimate or even kissed.
    we have carried on inappropriate conversations via phone, e-mail and texting,
    and we have sent each other pictures through e-mail. my husband and i have now
    reconciled, but i have been stringing craig along on the chance that, if my marriage
    doesn''t work out, he''ll be there. i feel guilty about this. is what craig and
    i have done considered a form of cheating? what should i do? -- hedging my bets

    a few weeks ago, i met a group of friends at a local pub. "charlie" was the designated
    driver. as the evening progressed, i noticed charlie was drinking beer. when i
    mentioned it, he said he''d had only three. then he insisted he was fine and "it
    was only beer." i tried to explain the danger of driving while "buzzed" and told
    him i''d walk home. charlie then became insulted that i didn''t trust him to know
    his limits. he said i should relax and quit being so uptight. a few days later,
    some of my friends told me i had caused "unnecessary drama" that night and that
    my standards for the designated driver were "unrealistic." they also said that
    charlie wasn''t drunk and was totally capable of driving. but the fact remains,
    our designated driver wasn''t sober, and i wasn''t comfortable getting into a
    car with him. i voiced my opinion; now i''m being punished for it. did i judge

    i became fast friends with one of my husband''s co-workers after meeting her at
    a happy hour. we had fun going out, usually to dance clubs. one night when my
    husband tagged along, i overheard her tell him, "if you weren''t married, i could
    be with you." when i confronted her about it the next night, she apologized, saying
    she had been feeling no pain and can''t believe she said it. my husband chalks
    it up to her being stupid drunk, but i can''t let it go. now when i see her at
    work functions, i am cordial and she acts like nothing ever happened. we could
    have been great friends if she hadn''t said what she did, but each time i think

    doesn''t "smooth" know that bald is the new "sexy"? if he is uncomfortable with
    his hairline, he should see a barber or stylist who can make what hair he has

    you are correct that plenty of women will date balding men. aside from your assertion
    that we are the smart ones who see beyond the surface, balding is supposed to
    be a sign of virility. i do have one question for "smooth-headed": are you willing
    to date women who are less than supermodels? many women i know, myself included,
    are smart, funny and sexy, but have been spurned because we are slightly overweight.
    what i have learned is that people who sit around whining about the opposite sex
    being shallow should review their own biases and unrealistic expectations. who

    i met "guy" seven years ago and fell deeply in love. we dated for a couple of
    months, but one day with no warning he broke up with me on my voicemail. three
    weeks after the breakup, guy came to my home. it was the week of his wedding,
    which he never bothered to mention. i later heard he had been married from a mutual
    friend. i knew guy had been seeing someone, but he never indicated that it was
    serious. we have been having an affair ever since our breakup. because i love
    him, i can''t say no to him. he''ll go through periods where he says he''s getting
    divorced. he even told my mom that. then he calls and says they''re going to work
    it out. i never pushed. i want him to be happy -- even if it''s not with me --
    and i want no part in causing a divorce. every time i start to get over guy, he
    comes around again. it''s like he has radar. the last time we slept together,
    a month ago, he told me he thought he had married the wrong woman. the next day,
    he admitted he has too much at stake to make a change. i am in so much pain. i
    don''t want to be his mistress. if i tell his wife, guy will never speak to me

    last year i decided to pursue a career as a foreign diplomat. my wife and i weighed
    the pros and cons and concluded that the opportunity was worth the separation
    from family and friends. i''m proud that i''ll be able to provide the kind of
    life for my family that we have always wanted, and i''m set to begin training
    soon. we have begun spreading the news, and most of our relatives and friends
    share our excitement. my wife''s sister, "lucinda," however, is furious. her objections
    started with snide little "jabs" but have grown into a full-blown assault. she
    is accusing me of ruining her life and threatening to cut off all contact unless
    we reconsider. my wife is distraught from the badgering and i''m afraid their
    relationship is on the verge of collapse. should i bow to lucinda''s threats or

    my adult daughter, "suzie," spent the weekend at our home, bringing along her
    boyfriend of six months. this was "liam''s" first visit. i allowed them to share
    suzie''s old bedroom, which we have converted into a family office. we keep a
    large futon in there for my daughter when she comes to visit. i didn''t make a
    big deal out of where liam and suzie should sleep because i didn''t want to embarrass
    them, and i was sure there would be no "hanky-panky" because our bedroom is right
    across the hall. well, i was wrong. in the middle of the night i was awakened
    by suzie''s squeals and moans. fortunately, my husband is a sound sleeper. the
    next morning, while my husband was out on his daily run, i let the kids have it
    -- to the point of slapping liam around a little. i told suzie her actions were
    disrespectful and i was highly disappointed in her. suzie and i are no longer
    speaking and i am miserable. do you think i overreacted? did i silently give permission
    for such behavior by allowing them to share the same futon? and did liam really
    think it would be ok to have sex in my home? -- miserable mom in wisconsin'

    "dave" is 49, well-educated, gainfully employed and still lives with his parents.
    he has never been married and has no children. his dating history is "sketchy"
    -- he claims never to have had a serious relationship with a woman. when i asked
    him why he has never lived on his own, he told me he feels comfortable living
    with his parents. dave and i have enjoyed a strictly platonic relationship for
    nearly a year. he recently told me he''s in love with me and wants us to be exclusive,
    with marriage as the ultimate outcome. i have been divorced for 20 years. my children
    are independent, thriving adults. marrying again is not a priority in my life.
    dave is kind, sensitive and thoughtful. i care for him deeply, yet i am skeptical
    about becoming seriously involved with a man who seems to be "hiding" something.
    am i being overly critical, or is there something wrong with this picture? --

    when my two boys were young, i agreed to a reduction in child support payments

    is refusing to help. when i asked him to at least help with the costs of their

    met dave -- my husband of 10 years -- i told him my feelings. he said it was fine

    has been a happy one. after constant nagging by my mother about "when are you

    we wouldn''t be having any. now dave is no longer invited to their home for monthly

    give her grandchildren." dave says that because he is "uninvited" i shouldn''t

    my darling wife passed away after 38 years of marriage. after she died, her sister
    and i began talking on the phone as a way to get me through a very difficult time.
    a year later, i finally asked her to dinner. we have discovered we have feelings
    for each other. do you think there is anything wrong with this, and are we wrong

    on april 6, you printed my letter about having been sent a photocopy of a high
    school graduation announcement. no picture was included, nor a card -- just the
    photocopy folded into a cheap envelope. (the "real" ones had been sent to more
    "important" people!) you called me to discuss my letter, and your call made my
    day. my mom happened to call me right after i got off the phone, and when i told
    her my letter was being printed in your column, she informed me that she had actually
    received a photocopy of a thank-you card that day, from the same person i was
    talking about in my letter. these people continue to floor me. anyway, i hope
    this is the last "photocopy" story you''ll be getting about them. but who knows?

    my son and his girlfriend decided to go to an afternoon matinee. two older women
    sat down behind them. when the movie started, one of them began a loud, running
    commentary to the other. after a few minutes, my son and his girlfriend moved
    to seats four rows farther down, but they could still hear the woman explaining
    step-by-step what was happening on the screen. he turned around and made a shushing
    sound, and in a loud voice she responded, "my friend is blind and i''m explaining
    what''s happening on the screen." other people changed seats, too. my son understood
    how a blind person might want to enjoy hearing a movie, but her companion should
    have told her this was a public place and she would have to wait until they go
    home to have it explained in full, or wait for the dvd to come out so they could
    talk at home while it was on. abby, wasn''t it rude to destroy everyone else''s

    i''m a gay 44-year-old man with self-esteem problems. i have never seen myself
    as worthy of affection, and i don''t consider myself attractive. i have never
    been in a relationship, and no one outside of my family has ever said "i love
    you" to me. i have recently tried to come out of my shell. as a result, the network
    of people i associate with has tripled -- and i think that has compounded my problem.
    aside from parties where everyone is invited, i never hear from any of these people.
    i have only a couple of good friends, people i can talk to. i have leaned on my
    friends to try to help me with my problem. but i''m afraid if i keep unloading
    on them it''ll wear them down, and i don''t want to burden them. i wish i didn''t
    feel so worthless. i know part of my problem is the fact that i am unemployed

    my office was relocated recently, a bit farther away from home than the old one.
    my new commute involves riding public transportation and then a shared shuttle
    van. one of my co-workers, "phil," rides the same shuttle. he always waits for
    me to get off the shuttle so he can walk with me to the office. he seems nice
    enough and well-meaning, but my mornings are my time to prepare myself for the
    day. he also occasionally touches my arm, which makes me uncomfortable. he also
    talks about personal things i would rather not hear about. i would prefer to walk
    without him, but there is no other way to get to the office. i have debated being
    10 minutes late to work each day, but then i would need to stay 10 minutes later
    and it would be much harder for me to catch the later shuttle. what do i do? tell
    phil i don''t want to walk with him? walk faster? go in later? -- uncomfortable
