  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my husband and i are newly married and have been working for a large, well-known
    retail store for several years. when a store posts its hours on the front door,
    there is no excuse for a customer to waltz in three minutes before closing time
    and expect to shop the entire store. even if no hours are posted, one can assume
    that the doors will be closing at 9 p.m. this is standard for retail stores. (holidays
    and weekends may vary.) almost every night people stroll in three to five minutes
    before closing time. we will approach them and ask, "is there anything i can help
    you find?" invariably they say, "no, thanks. i''m just looking." (on rare occasions,
    a considerate customer will say, "oh, thank you, i''ll come back tomorrow.") thirty
    minutes after we have locked the doors and are waiting to close the registers,
    these "lookie-loos" stroll out, without so much as a thank-you or apology. how
    i wish i could say, "you may have nothing to do and nowhere to go, but most of
    us clerks have families waiting for us at home, sometimes a hot dinner cooling
    on the table, or a child waiting for a goodnight kiss. we''re tired and want to
    get out of the store. please give us a break." -- anonymous, naturally'

    i''m writing this letter for all of those well-meaning people who subscribe to

    came up. mom said, "aug. 23, 1925," and i said, "no, mom -- it''s 1924." she turned
    to me and said, "hush. we''ll talk about this later." i was 22 years old when

    foolish because in mom''s large family, i was the only one who was unaware of
    this fact of my birth. when i asked her, "why, mom, why?" she said, "because dad
    made me promise you would never know of it in his lifetime." apparently this proud
    man could not bear the thought that i might consider him imperfect. it was easy
    for mom to go along with it because she always tried to protect me by withholding

    their time as scouts. later he worked with adult training, helping other leaders
    to better serve the youth of our area. in all those years, he spent thousands

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i desperately need some advice. i have been married for 12 years to a woman who
    is very self-centered. her main concern is her job. she couldn''t care less if
    we live in a pigsty. she feels that her long hours at work excuse her from any
    home responsibilities. i realize that people have certain obligations to their
    jobs, but i have talked to her co-workers who have similar workloads, and most
    of them get their work done during regular office hours and don''t have to stay
    late. abby, i am ashamed to have guests come to our home. she does clean before
    her co-workers come over, but otherwise she doesn''t bother. you can''t even get
    into our bedroom because of wall-to-wall clothes piled all over. and our children
    are patterning their lifestyles after hers. i do more than my share around the
    house. i am the main caregiver to our children, and i''m the one who stays home
    with them when they''re sick. to make a point, i recently stopped cleaning. now
    no one cleans. i have talked to my wife about this. she assures me she''ll do
    better, but nothing changes. this has begun to affect my feelings for her. i''m
    very family-oriented, but if changes are not made soon, our marriage may not survive.

    greetings from the great state of new mexico. as you stated in your column, domestic
    violence can occur in any family at any level of our society. and it must be dealt
    with by an equally broad spectrum of the population. you asked the pertinent question,
    "why is he using violence?" as was pointed out in a previous letter, violence
    begets violence. it is a continuing message our society sends to all of its children
    through television shows and movies that use violence, often murder, as the solution
    to problems. until we can change the vision of violence presented as entertainment
    to our children, there are shorter-term steps we can take as a community to end
    domestic violence. in new mexico (in which 46 percent of all female homicides
    are the result of domestic violence), our legislature has taken steps to protect
    the victims. it passed a bill that makes stalking a crime. the legislature has
    also passed laws that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against
    women who have been treated for domestic abuse, and that allow women to file for
    protective orders in the court without paying a fee. these new laws exist because
    of the dedicated lobbying efforts of the violence against women task force, a
    group of concerned professionals that i formed to address domestic violence and
    sexual assault in new mexico. more important, the laws would not have been possible
    without the participants who shared their own stories -- many painful to relive
    -- to make us aware of the shortcomings and gaps in the system. i hope our experience
    in new mexico encourages other communities to unite against a common enemy and
    take action against domestic violence. -- tom udall, new mexico attorney general'

    felt i owed her something. our daughter needed a car to get to work, but her father
    wouldn''t agree to help her finance one. she asked me to co-sign on a loan, and
    i made the biggest mistake of my life when i agreed. a few weeks after she got
    the car, she lost her job. i didn''t realize that the car payment was being automatically
    withdrawn from my account, but i don''t always check my bank statement. i was
    horrified when i saw there was a big shortage -- she had not deposited enough
    money to cover the payment. she told me she had, but that was a lie. she also
    lied to me about money several times after that. i asked my husband for help with
    the account, but he refused and asked our daughter to move out. that meant she
    had to pay rent and utilities, so there was no way she could make up the back
    payments. abby, i am so far behind on my bills i don''t know what to do. i tried

    a year ago, my husband and i moved his 76-year-old mother into a very lovely retirement
    home because all her friends had abandoned her, she was seeing far too many doctors,
    and her daughters had given up on her because of her negative "poor me" attitude.
    my husband and i see her at least once a week and her daughters call her every
    sunday. the place where she now lives is expensive, but well worth it. she has
    met many new, wonderful people. so what''s the problem? her downbeat, negative
    attitude has resurfaced, and we''re beginning to understand why people walked
    away from her before. she calls me daily to give me detailed information about
    all her bodily functions. i dread her calls. i work hard to be an "up" person
    and have tried to be a supportive daughter-in-law because i know she''s in pain.
    she is bringing my husband and me down with her. i have talked to her about the
    rewards of a positive attitude -- but the odd thing is, she seems to think she
    has one. please help, abby. what can we do? -- at my wit''s end'

    forty-five years old may not seem too old to attract someone of the opposite sex,
    but i''m not your average-looking 45-year-old. i have terrible wrinkles under
    my eyes that add years to my appearance. in the last couple of years, i have developed
    deep lines that run from each side of my nose down to my lips. i''ve tried every
    conceivable moisturizer and concealant, but nothing helps. i know this is a natural
    part of aging, but i cannot accept that at age 45 i look so old a man won''t even
    give me a second look, much less open a door for me or try to strike up a conversation.
    wherever i go, men look only at nice-looking, younger women -- something i no
    longer am. i have become lonely and despondent at the realization that i will
    probably be alone for the rest of my life. i''ve tried joining groups, doing volunteer
    work and even taking night classes to meet someone who might look beyond the wrinkles,
    but no one shows the slightest interest in me anymore. i''m friendly, courteous
    and approachable, and the proper weight for my height. but i guess you can''t
    make filet mignon out of chopped liver. if i could do something about these terrible
    wrinkles, my confidence would soar, and i wouldn''t have to spend the rest of
    my life alone. however, because i can barely make ends meet and cannot afford
    cosmetic surgery, i see no hope. any advice, abby? -- hurting in whittier, calif.'

    as a young parent, i was appalled to hear other parents threaten to call the police
    and have their children taken to jail when they misbehaved. i am now in my 80s
    and i''m horrified to see that the same threat is still being used. i raised five
    children and taught them that the police were their friends. it paid off when
    my 4-year-old son, larry, disappeared while we were shopping. as i frantically
    searched for him, i spotted him perched on an officer''s shoulder. after having
    larry identify me, the policeman laughed and told me that larry had approached
    him for help. when he asked my son if he was lost, larry answered: "no, i''m not
    lost. i''m here. my mamma is lost. will you find her for me?" that was only one
    time out of many that the police have befriended us. i wish you would print something
    to the effect that law enforcement officers are there to help. also, i do not
    believe in corporal punishment. i have always felt that children are usually punished
    when parents are angry, not when the children are naughty. as my mother always
    said, "what you are too stupid to teach them, you cannot knock into them." so
    i have never had to resort to corporal punishment. i love your column and your

    a few years ago, a man named robert wrote to you. he was brokenhearted because
    a girl he loved would not wait for his return from a mission for the special operations
    branch of the army. you told him that the lady he lost was in fact the loser.
    your kind response meant a lot to him. how do i know? today it is i who waits
    for this wonderful man. i met robert two years ago on the internet. i was a single
    mother living on a farm in the foothills of north carolina. robert was living
    in california. soon after we met, he was deployed to guam on a voluntary mission.
    with internet access in guam, we were able to continue our relationship, which
    was built on communication and a mountain of faith. we eventually grew to love
    each other. in march 1997, robert flew directly to north carolina from guam and
    we met face-to-face for the first time. it was a dream come true for both of us.
    robert and i drove to california to stay with his family while we finalized wedding
    plans and looked for a home of our own. shortly after we arrived, we learned that
    robert would deploy again, this time involuntarily as part of a civil affairs
    mission to bosnia. his orders were for 270 days. today i patiently await his return,
    when i will become his wife. he is the love of my life and i am grateful we found
    each other. abby, you were right when you said someday there will be a girl deserving
    of robert''s love and she will have the patience to wait for him. well, that girl
    is me. thank you for your letter to him those few years ago. you gave him faith

    you printed a letter recently warning your readers that ads for lost items placed
    in local newspapers might wind up on the internet. the writer said that scam artists
    would contact them offering to return the item -- after receiving money "to pay
    the shipping charges." this seems illogical to me. why is there a good chance
    that one''s "lost" classified ad would be placed on the internet? who would do
    that? certainly not the scam artist, who wouldn''t want to share his source of
    income with anyone else. didn''t it occur to your letter writer to ask for a complete
    description of the lost item? even if a scamster were able to provide a description
    of my "lost" wristwatch, i could always trip him up by asking, "is it engraved
    on the back, ''to my darling husband from mary''?" when the scamster answers,
    "yes," i''d then respond, "then you found someone else''s watch. mine is not engraved."

    women think that holidays are only for them? let''s take last year, for example:
    on valentine''s day, i gave my wife a lovely silver and gold choker with matching
    bracelet and earrings. i would have loved to have seen a bottle of champagne in
    the bedroom, or received an invitation to go out for dinner. neither happened.
    three months before our anniversary, i planned a weekend at a first-class resort,
    and for her birthday, we went on a two-week cruise. this was all booked and paid
    for in advance. on our anniversaries, i am lucky to get a card from her. abby,
    we live in an affluent community, and i see many wives making a fuss over their
    husbands. but every time i mention my feelings, my wife tells me that holidays
    are for wives. the topper was when she said, "i go to bed with you; what else
    do you want?" her favorite is, "you have everything; i don''t know what to get
    for you." i could go on for days, but this is enough for one letter. thanks for

    save on food expenses. ned makes twice the money i do, and consequently he claims
    he has the right to make most of the decisions in our life. i tried going to college
    so i could get a better job, but working full time and attending school was very

    personal outgoing calls the employee made. not only was that employee''s time
    used for personal business, but the receptionist had to take the calls, refer
    them and/or take a message. these employees do not consider how much of the receptionist''s
    time they waste, not to mention time for which the boss is paying them. abby,
    this is plain stealing! had they been emergency calls, i wouldn''t have minded
    -- but calls to plan a party, discuss the highlights she wanted her beauty operator

    put off checking it out. after my report, he kept tabs on his staff for a while.

    my sister and her husband and children have completely severed their relationship

    clothing still reeking of our sister-in-law''s perfume. my sister and her daughter

  body: 'dear readers: can you believe it? it''s valentine''s day already! and what
    better time to revive my ten commandments of love. yes, dear readers, i actually
    had the chutzpah to write my own ten commandments. but it wasn''t as though i
    was stealing from strangers; one of my ancestors was privileged to have received
    them on mount sinai from the lord himself -- at least that''s what the good book
    says. originally, i wrote two sets of commandments -- one for men and one for
    women. then mandy stillman, a lawyer from milwaukee, pointed out that one set
    of commandments should apply to both men and women. she was right, of course.
    so how''s this for a gender bender? the ten commandments of love -- put your spouse
    before your mother, your father, your son and your daughter -- your mate is your
    lifelong companion. -- do not abuse your body with excessive food, tobacco, drink,
    or any foreign substance that goes into your arm or up your nose. -- remember
    that cleanliness is a virtue. -- willingly share all of your worldly goods with
    your mate. -- do not forget to say, "i love you." even though your love may be
    constant, your spouse needs to hear those cherished words often. -- remember that
    the approval of your spouse is worth far more than the adoring glances of a hundred
    strangers, so be true to him or her, and forsake all others. -- permit neither
    your business nor your hobby to make you a stranger to your spouse. the most precious
    gift you can give is time. -- keep your home in good repair, because out of it
    come the joys of old age (not to mention its resale value). -- forgive with grace,
    because who among us does not need to be forgiven? -- honor the lord your god
    every day of your life, and your children will grow up to bless you. today, be
    a sweetheart. call someone you love and say, "i love you." (make two or three
    calls; who says you can''t love more than one person -- in different ways, of
    course.) go through your closets and give all those clothes that you''ve been
    saving until you lose 10 pounds to your favorite charity. call someone who''s
    lonely and say, "i''m thinking of yu." or, better yet, say, "i''ll be over tomorrow
    to take you to lunch, run some errands for you, or give you a ride." visit a sick
    friend. say a prayer. donate some blood. adopt a pet. will your eyes, your kidneys
    and all your usable organs to someone who can use them after you''re gone. forgive
    an enemy. hug your teen-ager. write a fan letter. listen to a bore. pay your doctor.
    tell your parents you think they''re wonderful. spay your dog. neuter your cat.
    quit smoking. drive carefully. if you''re walking, watch where you''re going.
    and don''t wait until next year to be a sweetheart again. -- love, abby'

    my husband passed away suddenly from a heart attack seven months ago. we had been
    married 15 years and have two children, 14 and 15. he was a very loving husband
    and great father. we had a wonderful life together. a short time after his death,
    i began having strong feelings for his unmarried brother, "william." i always
    liked william, but since he is the direct opposite of my late husband, i never
    expected this to happen. now i am head-over-heels in love with william. when i
    confessed my feelings to him, he held me and kissed me and helped me cope with
    the loss of my husband, but he refuses to get any closer to me. he says he feels
    guilty because i was married to his brother. i have talked to his family and mine,
    and most of them just want me to be happy. my children adore him. i know my dear
    late husband would have no objections. he loved us both and would want us to be
    happy. william and i see each other about three times a week and we get along
    great, but he is still reluctant to touch me except to hug me goodbye when i leave.

    how would you like to be one of 44 million people in the united states with a

    of tinnitus sufferers hear repeatedly. in 1993, a loud ringing sound began in
    one of my ears. it was driving me crazy and made it impossible to sleep. i became
    stressed out and depressed. it was impossible to continue to work because i was
    always tired. not a single doctor could help. finally, one doctor referred me
    to a local american tinnitus association (ata) support group. when i called, they
    gave me immediate assistance, empathetic care and understanding, and helpful information
    which led me to realize that i could manage this condition and lead a productive
    life. the ata was founded in 1971. it publishes a magazine, "tinnitus today,"
    that keeps its members up-to-date on the latest research and treatments for tinnitus.
    in addition, it sponsors research, testifies before congress to encourage more
    research and has support groups all over the united states. thank you, abby, for

    and claims he''ll get a divorce when his wife can handle it. the wife does not
    know he has been dating the younger woman, and the younger woman thinks he has
    fallen out of love with his wife. abby, this man socializes publicly with his
    wife and sneaks around with my friend. she''s a beautiful girl, and a very nice

    i have never seen this mentioned in your column, but i''ll bet it''s an issue
    for others as it is for me. i have been with my life partner for more than 15
    years. when we kiss, he does not close his eyes. i have mentioned this to him
    several times. i told him that i feel he is cold, distant and lacking in passion
    when he kisses me with his eyes open. i told him it was like kissing my grandmother.
    while he periodically tries to close his eyes, he always seems to revert to kissing
    with his eyes open. he says he''s more comfortable that way. have you or your
    readers run across this problem, and if so, how was it resolved? -- kissless in

    my mother has always suffered with various degrees of depression. she no longer
    takes medication or sees a therapist, but perhaps she should. when mom and i go
    to lunch together, or when i call her, the conversations are always about the
    wrongs dad has done to her throughout their whole marriage. i''ve heard these
    stories since childhood, and here i am at 32 still being forced to listen to the
    same old tales of woe. because i have heard all this before, i have little patience
    with her. when i try to change the subject or request she stop complaining, she
    makes me the enemy and a fight ensues. dad always insists that i apologize so
    mom won''t go into another deep depression. abby, mom has no friends, only enemies.
    i suggested she join church groups, etc., so she will have a life, but she still
    dwells mainly in the past. dad can''t see that i''m trying to bring her into the
    present when i ask her not to rehash the past. i want to enjoy my mother''s company
    and have her enjoy mine. abby, what can i do to make our visits more pleasant?

    re: promise keepers. the original promises were made at the wedding in front of
    the families, friends and, usually, god. why do new promises have to be made?
    why do promises to women have to be made in the absence of women? any time a group
    is excluded from an organization, it implies the group is believed not to be worthy
    of membership. i am willing to apply this both to the promise keepers and the
    national organization for women (now). i am all for keeping promises. but i''d
    find it more credible if the male promise keepers stayed home and did the dishes,
    rather than having another night out with the boys. in this regard, i see little

    i am in a heartbreaking predicament. i have been married to "steve" for three
    years. i knew shortly after the wedding that i had made a mistake. i am not in
    love with steve, even though he is a good man. i don''t think he loves me either.
    about nine months ago, because i was miserable and had sunk into a deep depression,
    i tried unsuccessfully to end the marriage. steve and i were separated for about
    six months. the problem is my family thinks he is the greatest thing since sliced
    bread. during our separation, they were closer to him than they were to me. he
    and i never attended church when we were married, yet when we separated, steve
    joined my parents'' church and shows up there every time the doors are open. he
    has everyone convinced, including my family, that he is perfect. in private, he
    is far from perfect. after six months of separation, my family convinced me to
    go back and try again. we have been together for three months, and i''m more miserable
    than ever. i desperately want out -- to get on with my life -- but i fear i may
    lose my family. they are convinced i am completely in the wrong. i used to be
    an outgoing person, but i am beginning to feel suicidal. i haven''t left my home

    your response to "crushed in arlington, texas" missed the boat entirely! the man
    who complained about the writer''s cooking is not going to change; if they marry,
    he''ll complain about many aspects of their life. i know. i was that man in my
    younger days, and i was not placated by improvements in my wife''s endeavors.
    this is just one of many tools in a control freak''s bag of tricks. the only reason
    our marriage survived was my wife''s willingness to challenge me on every complaint
    and not suffer quietly. i would not ask any woman to go through what my wife did
    to reach our present 42 years of life together. it''s far too long to wait for
    a spouse to understand his problem. my response to "crushed" would have been:
    ask yourself, will he change? be honest. will you be happy living with someone
    who will find fault no matter how hard you try? i suggest a showdown with him
    if you''re unwilling to end the relationship; do not enter into marriage with
    this unresolved. (actually, my gut feeling is that "crushed" should end the relationship.)
    let''s face it, abby, isn''t "finding fault" just another way for those control
    freaks among us to maintain control over others? does it have anything to do with
    how well others perform? i think not. the problem is more serious than you indicated
    and should be treated as such. however, writing this letter does allow me to complain
    about you, so what does that say about me, abby? -- been there, done that, azusa,

    my husband and i have a different opinion about the rules of marital separation.
    early in our marriage, following the birth of a child, my husband became unhappy
    with our union. without warning, he announced that he was moving out for a trial
    separation. during that time he slept with another woman. he claims that his infidelity
    was justified because he had moved out. had i known that the separation was his
    idea of permission to resume a single lifestyle, i would likely have made very
    different decisions on my own behalf. if his rules apply, whenever i feel i''m
    "unhappy" and need to get away, it''s ok to take a nice vacation and sleep with
    whomever i find attractive. however, i doubt he would approve of the shoe being
    on the other foot, although he thought it was permissible for him to behave that
    way. i believe a trial separation serves as a vehicle for couples to work out
    their differences and in no way nullifies the marriage vows. in my opinion, only
    when there is intent to dissolve the marriage and a suit for divorce has been
    legally filed are the vows waived. i say he cheated on me and had an affair. he
    says not. abby, what do you say? -- forgiving but unable to forget in california'

    several years ago, i became romantically involved with a prominent lawyer who
    represented my in-laws in a bitter legal battle. we secretly began spending lots
    of time together. i was 24 years old, catholic, married with one child. he was
    50, jewish, married with three children. we saw or called each other daily. i
    became pregnant and delivered a beautiful baby girl who is the spitting image
    of him. shortly after, his family learned about us through his office, and took
    it very hard. i apologized for the pain our relationship caused them. with great
    regret, he ended the relationship because he claimed he "had no choice." he has
    not called me since. after the breakup, my husband insisted on a paternity test,
    which clearly proved he was not the father. i never told the lawyer that the baby
    is his, because i care for him and i''m afraid of jeopardizing his license. my
    husband agreed to raise her as his own, provided i never tell the lawyer he''s
    the father. abby, i will be face-to-face with this lawyer at a trial very soon,
    and i will have to divulge pertinent information on him, and it''s possible our
    relationship and daughter may be exposed. what should i do? -- "boob-bie"'

    there is no doubt in my mind that you sincerely care about the people who write
    to you. you always try your utmost to give them sound advice. unfortunately, there
    are two sides to every story. the letter from "little league mom, fruitland park,
    fla." praised orel hershiser while chastising the other athletes her sons wrote
    to during the world series. the time elapsed between the letter sent to the players
    and the time her letter to you was printed was just a few weeks. (she noted that
    hershiser was pitching in the series when they wrote to the players.) this is
    such a small time lapse. the primary reason the players probably didn''t autograph
    the cards was the high prices people pay for autographs. many players have stopped
    signing autographs at games because adults get children to obtain them -- and
    then the adults sell the autographs. this is using the children and the players,
    and it''s wrong. what''s to stop a con man from mailing in numerous requests for
    autographs using the return addresses of friends and neighbors? if the mother
    wants her sons to have autographs, she should take her children to card shows
    that often will have stars on hand to sign autographs for a fee. -- douglas d.

    before we were married, my husband, "tony," had card parties for his buddies every

    i''ve suggested rotating the parties to the other players'' homes, which he did
    a few times. but now, because we''ve argued about it so often, he stubbornly refuses

    i''m in quite a dilemma. my 40-year-old daughter is not speaking to me because
    i''m trying to prevent her from becoming the laughingstock of the century. she''s
    planning to be married for the fourth time. her first marriage was to escape her
    abusive father. the second was to provide a father for her child from the first
    marriage. the third was a stupid mistake. now she says she wants the wedding she
    has never had -- ivory dress, 6-foot train, and god knows what else. i told her
    she was creating a circus, a humiliation, the embarrassment of all time. i know
    the bride should have her wishes carried out to the letter on "her" day -- but
    she has already had three previous "days" that did not work. my daughter falls
    in and out of love as the wind changes. i know i shouldn''t throw stones because
    i have been married three times, but my present marriage to a man i thank the
    lord for every day has lasted 17 years. i have talked to her fiance. he seems
    to be level-headed, and he, too, would like to avoid a spectacle. i''m sure he
    didn''t win any brownie points when he sided with me. it''s his first marriage.

    the letter in your column from the reader who thought it would be a good idea
    to turn closed military bases into jails got me thinking. as a retired military
    person, i must agree in part with the writer of that letter. the facilities are
    there, and so is the equipment to train our young people to become good citizens.
    but why use them to warehouse criminals? some of them could be converted to campuses
    for vocational schools around the country to help disadvantaged youth. not all
    of our young people are college material -- but all of them need to learn how
    to earn a living. students could spend part of their day in classroom learning
    and the rest in a shop, learning a skill. at the completion of their training
    they could be the people they would like to be. we taxpayers have bought those
    bases and equipped them with everything that is needed to run a military installation.
    if the selected base needs more equipment, some could be moved from other bases
    that are being closed. if some of the buildings are substandard, i can''t imagine
    a better place to start training those young people for a trade in the building
    industry. a final thought: most of these young people would rather have a big
    hug and an "i love you" than parents who let them grow up in the wrong way. speaking
    for myself, the return of love from a young person is the greatest gift i ever
    had. parents, wake up! abby, please do not use my name or location. -- retired

    i never dreamed i''d be writing to anyone for advice, but i have a problem. i
    have been seeing this man since last february. i like him a lot, and he seems
    to feel the same about me. i am 76 and he is 64. our problem is his ex-wife. she
    comes to his house every friday evening and stays until sunday evening. he sees
    me monday through friday afternoons, and sometimes in the evenings. she acts like
    they are still married and still wears her wedding rings, but they are divorced.
    she drinks and needs help, or so he tells me. i told him if she needs help, there
    are other places she can go to get it. (they have four children.) he doesn''t
    want me to call him on the weekends, as it upsets her. frankly, this hurts me.
    i have feelings too. i have been waiting patiently for him to get rid of her.
    he says he doesn''t want her at his home, but he doesn''t do anything about it.
    should i forget him and move on? i''m sure i could find someone else because i

    what is it with people who do not want to go to a nursing home when they get old?
    i often read about the anguish families go through when an oldster can no longer
    live independently. younger family members have their own ordeals, but old folks
    seem to hang onto houses they can''t keep up and mountains of accumulated "treasures"
    of questionable value. they see only two options: stay put, or have the kids take
    them in. my aunt, however, was another story. she wasn''t wealthy, but had a little
    money and was smart with what she had. she was widowed at 50, worked until retirement,
    then set about to enjoy herself. one fine day in her 70s, she informed me that
    she had visited two retirement homes and knew where she intended to move when
    she needed looking after. she bought the dress for her funeral, picked out the
    casket, chose the hymns and helped the preacher write her eulogy. "now," she proclaimed,
    "i''m just going to enjoy life until the end." what an inspiration! abby, most
    people are far too attached to material things for their own good. i suppose giving
    up my material things will also be difficult, but the hardest thing for me would
    be giving up my dogs. but then, why would i want to be schlepping out to walk
    a pooch every morning and evening when i am old and feeble? as for insisting on
    dying at home (as if that''s some tender and sentimental thing to do), it''s unfair
    to saddle loved ones with such difficult and depressing circumstances. i recently
    read that about 30 percent of people would choose suicide over a nursing home!
    are they nuts? give me clean, pleasant surroundings for my final days. while my
    attitude may strike some as insensitive and cold, actually i love life and intend
    to live it to the fullest, like my aunt who never made it to the nursing home.
    at age 83, she had a massive stroke while boarding a tour bus and died almost
    immediately. why is it that so many who say, "i don''t want to be a burden," do
    everything to become one by imposing on relatives or forcing decisions on others
    when they are no longer able to live alone? i know this is long, but i think it
    bears an important message. -- living it up ''til the end'

    my letter is in response to "grace in tampa, fla.," who was worried about her

    perhaps they shouldn''t go to the extreme of saying she cannot even write to the
    boy. why don''t they check him out, verify who lives at the address, and speak
    with him to see what he is like? if things check out ok, they should read the
    letters he has already written to make sure the correspondence is appropriate,

    my husband, "wayne," and i met in high school. after high school, our friendship

    who are now 10, 8 and 5. i thought we would have a bright future together and
    watch our children grow. two years ago, he began experiencing unusual symptoms
    and went to see his doctor. we learned days later that he had leukemia. for a
    year and a half, wayne fought to survive. unfortunately, it was not to be. i lost
    my friend, my husband and the father of my children. i am now a 35-year-old widow,

    told me during his illness that he didn''t want another man to raise our children.
    it was one of his last wishes. abby, was he being selfish, or should i abide by
    his wishes? i loved wayne more than all the stars in the sky. what i fear now

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    when i read your column about "huffing" chemicals, i had to respond. i was a teen-age
    solvent abuser. for most of my early school days, i was an overachiever. i was
    not popular, but i had one or two good friends and was active in scouting and
    volunteer activities. because i was into books and getting good grades, by junior
    high i was teased and beaten up by my schoolmates. high school brought more of
    the same merciless harassment. i began to withdraw into solitary activities and
    discovered model building. my descent into hell began innocently. i loved to build
    model cars, boats and planes. i discovered that the fumes from the glue gave me
    a buzz. soon i was buying as much as a tube of model glue a day and huffing the
    fumes. i staggered around in a fog most of the time, couldn''t remember things,
    and my grades slipped badly. i heard something on the news about kids who had
    died as a result of sniffing pam. i decided to try that as well, secretly hoping
    it would kill me. i huffed a number of other aerosol products, too. in my depression,
    i tried to kill myself by taking an overdose of aspirin. no luck. after the second
    overdose, a friend began dragging me along to activities and events and focused
    my attention on other things. my depression lifted, i managed to pull myself together,
    and i finished high school near the top of my class. a couple of years later depression
    set in again. i dropped out of life and began huffing glue again. i huffed myself
    into unconsciousness and even a couple of seizures. paranoia and hallucinations
    became the norm. i woke up once and found myself carrying on a conversation with
    a tree -- yes, it was answering back! the police were called when i was found
    running around with a knife, sure someone was out to get me. i was hospitalized
    on at least three occasions. fast-forward 20 years: what do i have to show for
    my stupidity today? i stutter, and confuse similar-sounding words in conversation.
    my hands shake. i frequently have problems remembering things for more than a
    few minutes. worse yet, i''m now allergic to fragranced items including fabric
    softeners, detergent, hand lotion, perfume, cologne, hairspray and household cleaning
    items. did you know that perfumes contain toxic chemicals such as toluene -- the
    same stuff that''s in model glue? even though chemicals make me horribly ill,
    the craving to abuse them never quits! on a good day, i hate myself for the damage
    i''ve done to my brain and body. on a bad day, i wish i had succeeded in committing
    suicide years ago. parents: pay attention to your children and their behavior.
    have your children taken an unusual interest in being alone? does their breath,
    clothes or room smell funny? do they have balance problems while walking across
    a room? difficulty sleeping? no appetite? paranoia? grades falling? apathetic?
    personal hygiene lacking? do you find plastic bags with strange-looking dried-up
    white stuff in them? your children could be abusing glue or aerosol products!
    get them help -- and don''t take "no" for an answer. abusing household products
    is as dangerous as abusing illegal drugs. -- senseless in seattle'

    i would like to share something special with you. what began as a simple little
    experiment to give me insight into the people around me ended up giving me more
    than just the warm fuzzies. i asked some of those i work with and some close friends
    to answer the following question with the first thing that came to mind. i asked
    it exactly as stated with no emphasis on any one particular word: "if you could
    do any one thing in the world, what would it be?" some of the answers were amusing.
    my co-workers answered: "turn invisible." "lose 50 pounds." "educate the world."
    "i''d rule the world." my friends answered: "feel better about myself." "feed
    the world" "become a millionaire." i asked my boyfriend of five months at the
    time the same question. without hesitation, he answered, "i would give you a working
    pancreas." my jaw dropped, my heart melted and my eyes filled with tears. you
    see, abby, i have had type ii diabetes for nearly 10 years. thankfully, i am very
    well controlled and healthy, yet he knows that the daily rituals that control
    my life will never go away. i think i have finally met a man with my best interest
    at heart. how could i not love someone with such unselfish kindness? maybe there

    yet one more letter about tolerance. can we not be great americans and still hold

    beautiful and enriching traditions, and if we open ourselves to learning about

    i liked the letter from "knowing in the northwest" regarding depression. however,
    i wish you had made the point that there is a difference between emotional depression,
    which usually happens in response to an unfortunate event (such as death or divorce),
    and biochemical depression, which is often genetic and usually requires medication
    to be fully treated. the misunderstanding about the differences between these
    two conditions is widespread. i have had polar depression for more than 30 years.
    i am doing well on medication and am very grateful for this. however, i am tired
    of people who do not understand that there is such a thing as biochemical depression.
    people repeatedly ask what is depressing me. when i reply that i am not depressed
    about anything, and that the problem is biochemical, they insist that isn''t possible.
    these same people understand that diabetics need to take insulin because their
    bodies do not produce or properly use it. why can''t they comprehend that there
    are people who need antidepressants because their bodies are lacking a chemical?
    abby, please do all of us who suffer from polar depression or bipolar depression
    a great service by informing the public that some forms of depression are purely
    medical in origin. anyone who thinks otherwise is stuck in the misinformed thinking
    of 20 years ago, when getting in touch with your feelings was thought to cure
    all emotional ailments. i tried that. it simply didn''t work for polar depression.

    this letter is in response to the one you printed from the woman who signed herself
    "lost in a dream," who dreamed repeatedly about a former boyfriend. i can relate
    to her. when i was 13, i met my "first love." he was the same age. we lived 30
    minutes from each other, but we corresponded through letters and saw each other
    at monthly youth functions. it lasted more than a year. because of circumstances
    beyond our control, we were forced to part. it was one of the hardest things i
    ever did. neither one of us wanted to break it off, but it was something i just
    had to do. i saw him for the first time in about 10 years four years ago. it was
    very nice to see him again, but it brought back a lot of memories. now, 15 years
    from the time we broke up, i''m married and so is he. like "lost in a dream,"
    i have a wonderful marriage. but every so often i think of him and dream about
    him, and wonder "what if?" he was very special to me. some people call it "puppy
    love," but it was real to me. and for a 14-year-old, that was all that mattered.
    i want to tell "lost in a dream" that she is not alone. she is not a bad person
    for this. anything can trigger dreams. i am just relieved to know that i am not
    the only person who experiences this. thanks, abby, for printing that letter.

    i disagree emphatically with your responses to father francesco of newark and
    to "worried about my friend," who was concerned that her friend was entering into
    a bad marriage and did not want to be in the wedding. fifteen years ago last week,
    i was in that same predicament. wedding invitations had been sent; the arrangements
    had been made. two weeks before the wedding, a friend pulled me aside and told
    me to think hard about my decision and search my heart to be sure this was right
    for me. my friend reminded me that i had invited only people i cared about --
    and who cared about me -- to the wedding, and should i realize the wedding would
    be a mistake, they would support me. i canceled the wedding. friends and family
    who had made nonrefundable reservations came anyway and were there to support
    me on what would have been my wedding day. the experience made me realize that
    i lacked the tools to make a good choice for a lifelong mate. i got some help,
    and have been married 10 years to a wonderful man. if most brides won''t listen

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i''m a widow in my 60s, and i''m beginning to think i''m the biggest fool in the
    world. after my dear husband died two years ago, i convinced myself i would never
    get involved with another man. i needed peace after nursing my mate through five
    traumatic years of cancer and a painful death. a year ago, i met a charming man
    my age at church with whom i had many interests in common. he asked me out right
    after we met, and we have been a happy twosome ever since. he owns his own home
    a short distance from mine, and we''ve had a marvelous relationship in all ways.
    he told me he was divorced and that his ex-wife lived 3,000 miles away in another
    state. however, after he told me that he had four unmarried, grown children but
    didn''t feel comfortable telling them about me, i became suspicious. when he visits
    them in another state, he asks me not to write or call him because they "wouldn''t
    understand." my children and grandchildren like him very much, as do all my friends.
    finally, i asked him outright if he were, indeed, divorced. after a long pause
    he replied, "not yet." (after a eight-year separation!) noticing our friendship,
    church members began to approach me and advise me to back off and not get hurt.
    i was told he had been involved with another woman at the church for a long time
    before he met me, and that they had broken up for unknown reasons. the reason
    for this occurred to me -- that she didn''t want to be caught in a dead-end relationship,
    either. abby, this man won''t tell me straight, but i have this strong feeling
    that he cheated on his wife during their marriage, and she simply moved far away.
    he keeps my calendar full of dates and commitments extending far into the future,
    and i''ve always had a wonderful time with him. this is apparently the kind of
    life he wants, but it''s not for me. i am embarrassed and hurt. do i just say
    to him, "i want marriage or nothing"? i am so emotionally entangled that an abrupt
    severing seems beyond my ability. fragile as it is, i feel that we have something
    of great value together, but i only visualize an empty future together. your thoughts,

    my mother and stepfather would love to be the guardians of my children. my children

    to be a binge alcoholic and can recall incidents of her being drunk since i was
    7. i overcame my own alcohol and tobacco addictions because i wanted to do it
    for myself. i felt it was important to set a good example for my children. i knew
    i couldn''t expect them to listen to me tell them not to drink and smoke when
    i indulged in both nasty habits. now that i am free of these substances, i don''t
    know if i should approach my mother about this issue. should i tell her that i
    wouldn''t want my children growing up in a household where alcohol is used irresponsibly,

    after reading your column about outrageous mothers-in-law, i had to write. when
    i was 17, i married my high school sweetheart. he was only 20. we were entirely
    too young to get married. however, his mother never said a negative word about
    it. in fact, she was our most ardent supporter. the following year, we had a baby
    boy. we were too immature to have children, but my mother-in-law never said an
    unkind word. she was extremely kind and generous to my son and to me as well.
    she never once criticized the way i took care of the baby. when she came to visit,
    she asked me nicely what i wanted her to do, and then she did it. when i think
    of this now, it brings a smile. i was only 19 and knew nothing about babies, but
    still she respected my wishes as the mother of this child. if she had a negative
    opinion about me, she kept it to herself. after a few years, the marriage fell
    apart. the subsequent divorce and custody battle got very ugly. my mother-in-law
    never took sides. i am now happily remarried and live about 3,000 miles away from
    my former mother-in-law. my former husband has also remarried. neither of us has
    had any more children, so my 12-year-old son is my former mother-in-law''s only
    grandchild. he visits her every summer, and i keep her up-to-date as much as possible
    about his activities via e-mail and pictures. sometimes people are curious about
    why i work so hard to keep this connection to my ex-husband''s family. after all,
    according to the world''s expectations, we''re supposed to "hate" each other,
    right? wrong! this lady is a gem. she''s a sterling example of how people should
    treat each other. she and i had a long talk this summer about this very subject.
    i told her that i do not "own" my son. he''s part of her, too. and i would be
    doing a grave disservice as a parent to deny my child the gift of knowing this
    wonderful grandma. i only hope that someday i will be as terrific a mother-in-law

    along with millions of other americans, i am overweight. this time of year is
    particularly difficult for me because of the well-intentioned but misguided actions
    of friends and family. with the holidays upon us, i have the following suggestions
    for anyone who knows someone who is fighting the battle of the bulge (and who
    doesn''t?): 1. avoid giving gifts of food. this means all food -- even your special
    sugar-free coconut cream pie. giving chocolates or other fattening treats is,
    at the least, insensitive and borders on downright cruelty. 2. do not "push" food
    on another person. if you''re hosting a meal or a party, make a variety of healthy
    foods available along with any special treats you''ve prepared. allow your guests
    to choose for themselves without comment. it is especially unfair to use guilt
    ("i made these just for you") to force food upon someone. 3. do not comment on
    how much (or how little) someone is eating. such comments draw unwanted attention
    to attempts to maintain control of holiday eating. 4. have some compassion. we
    don''t want to be fat. losing weight and keeping it off is extraordinarily difficult
    for some of us. don''t think that you know what our problem is, because you don''t.
    obesity is a complicated issue with behavioral, emotional and spiritual elements.
    a single formula that works for everyone has yet to be discovered. finally, be
    supportive. if someone you love is trying to lose weight, be available to listen.

    my husband and i have been married for 38 years. during the past 10 of them, we
    have taken up dancing, and folks think we''re pretty good. my problem is, the
    place where we go has women who have no dancing partner, and they all want to
    dance with my husband, which leaves me sitting part of the night. there is one
    woman in particular who is younger than i am and who wants to do all the dances
    that i like to do with him. she had a dancing partner until just a few months
    ago. actually, her husband is there, too, but he doesn''t dance. my husband will
    tell me he''s too tired to dance to anything fast, and then she will ask him and
    he jumps up. he always says i should go ask other men to dance, but there is really
    no one there who can dance the way i like. am i wrong to let this bother me? --

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    your response to "frustrated and unappreciated," the mammographer who found it
    irritating to be asked, "is this all you do, all day long?" was right on the mark.
    however, "frustrated" also needs to gain a deeper understanding of her patients,
    as well as sensitivity toward them. has it not occurred to her that perhaps that
    question was an attempt at "small talk" by women who felt uncomfortable having
    a mammogram? because of my medical and family history, i have had mammograms yearly
    since i was 35. after 10 years, i still do not find the procedure of having the
    mammographer touch me to lift, pull and smash a personal part of my body between
    two plates of plastic something i look forward to or feel comfortable with. usually
    the mammographer is a different health-care professional from the prior year,
    therefore, a stranger. i have had mammographers who made me feel as much at ease
    as possible, but i have also experienced a few who treated my breast as if a woman
    was not attached to it. "frustrated" needs to understand and empathize. it''s
    important she remember that her job in performing mammographies is more routine
    for her than it is for her patients. perhaps understanding this will help her
    to focus on her patients'' feelings, and not become frustrated over a question.

    this is the time of year people begin thinking, "what should i get mom, dad and
    aunt tillie for christmas?" well, i am a mom and an aunt tillie, and i filled
    dad''s shoes for more years than i care to count. so, for all of you who haven''t
    a clue what "we" would like, keep reading: don''t try to buy me happiness with
    a token gift. most of all, i''d love just a little of your time. if you want to
    buy something for me, i''d appreciate a box of all-occasion greeting cards. a
    roll of stamps to go with them would also be helpful, so that when my old friends
    have a reason to celebrate, i''ll not have to venture to the store or post office.
    (an assortment of gift wrap and scotch tape are another novel idea.) you all know
    how much i love flowers -- not the cut bouquets from a florist, but real plants
    from a nursery, delivered at the right time for planting in the spring. something
    like that can be enjoyed all year, and i''ll remember your thoughtfulness every
    time i look at them. my little doggie needs grooming every month. how about a
    gift certificate? they make terrific gifts. also, i would never spend household
    budget money for a manicure, pedicure or massage, but a gift certificate for one
    would certainly be welcome. or one for a car wash, or the next trip to the dry
    cleaner or shoe repair shop. what about a gift certificate for a dinner for two,
    so i can treat a good friend to a meal and company because her family is also
    busy? have you forgotten how much i enjoy reader''s digest, family circle and
    tv guide? i can''t afford subscriptions anymore, but they would be a lot more
    welcome than bubble bath that i''m now allergic to. also, if you want to give
    me something, how about a prepaid phone card, or a few bucks prepaid on my telephone
    bill? and if you''re feeling generous, how about contacting the company that aerates
    my lawn, the chimney sweep or, for that matter, the mechanic who readies my car
    for winter? you see, we''re not as difficult to buy for as you thought. you have
    simply forgotten who we really are. we''re not "those old people down the street."

  body: 'dear readers: by popular demand, here is my traditional thanksgiving column:
    today is thanksgiving day, so take a few minutes to reflect upon all the things
    for which you are thankful. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve
    lived this long. a lot of people haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands -- maybe
    millions -- are hurting even more. (have you ever visited a veterans hospital?
    or a rehabilitation clinic for crippled children?) if you awakened this morning
    and were able to hear the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds,
    walk to the breakfast table on two good legs, and read the newspaper with two
    good eyes, praise the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook?
    thin? well, most of the world is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food
    stamps. no social security. in fact, one-third of the people in the world will
    go to bed hungry tonight. are you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one.
    if nobody calls you, pick up the phone and call someone. are you concerned about
    your country''s future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern. your
    country may not be a rose garden, but neither is it a patch of weeds. freedom
    rings! look and listen. you can still worship at the church of your choice, cast
    a secret ballot, and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on
    the head or a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different
    system, you are free to go. there are no walls or fences -- nothing to keep you
    here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will
    want to use it at your table today: o heavenly father: we thank thee for food
    and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank
    thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember
    the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service that thy gifts to us may
    be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving, and may god bless you
    and yours. -- love, abby an afterthought: want an instant high? the surest cure
    for the holiday blues is doing something nice for someone. why not call a person
    who lives alone and invite him or her to share dinner? better yet, call and say,
    "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." (some older people
    don''t drive, and those who do may not like to go out after dark.) try it. and
    let me know the results. p.s. special greetings to those of you in the military
    who wrote from remote corners of the world to tell me that you are using my prayer
    on this thanksgiving day.'

    i am 23 years old and was previously involved with a man who, at the beginning
    of our relationship, was married. at the time, i was 17 and about to graduate
    from high school, and had no previous relationship with a man. as our relationship
    progressed, his wife found out about us and divorced him. they had a child who
    was born in the midst of their divorce. i thought the split would send him flying
    to my arms. however, that was not the case at all. instead, he proceeded to sleep
    with everyone in a skirt who would give him the time of day. he denied our involvement
    with each other to everyone. even knowing all of this, i stayed for three years,
    and in the process i lost everything -- family, friends, jobs, just about everything
    i cherished. more important, i lost sight of myself, my goals, and the person
    i once thought i was. i thought if i loved him enough, he would change. well,
    it didn''t happen. what did happen was he got someone pregnant and lived with
    her for a year and a half. it was the last straw for me. i packed up and moved
    north and regained my life. i stopped dating for a long time, found the best job
    i''ve ever had, and am back in school working on my degree. i am living on my
    own, and my life is better now than it''s been in years. recently he left that
    other woman and has begun to better himself. he has a good job now and has matured
    a lot in the last five years. we have been talking, and he tells me that he loves
    me and has asked me to marry him. although he and i have been talking, i haven''t
    told anyone in my family or my friends. i know they would not accept him. abby,
    i''m afraid of the outcome. i thought i had closed this chapter in my life, but
    now i''m not so sure. i always wanted to marry the first man i had ever been intimate
    with, and he seems genuine this time around. should i give him a second chance?
    i know he put me through hell, and i''m leery of repeating it. should i try again
    and hope it all works out? -- lost in love, woodland hills, calif.'

    adopted. they always referred to me as an infant as their special adopted child.
    they told me stories all through my childhood about the king and queen who were
    very sad because they couldn''t have children of their own, so they went on a
    long journey and found a beautiful baby girl by the river who they adopted as
    their own and made their princess. they gave birth to a "natural" daughter 10
    months after i was born, and when we fought as children -- like all children do

    after only six years of marriage, my darling husband died on oct. 4. he had three
    children and taught them good values. he once said during our marriage, "when
    i die, i hope my kids don''t come in and start announcing, ''i want this'' or
    ''i want that.''" well, sure enough, two days after my husband''s death -- even
    before the funeral arrangements had been completed -- his son came to me with
    a verbal list of things they wanted. i kindly told him that his father and i had
    discussed what he would like them to have, and we would take care of it sometime
    later. i left his kids at home while i went out to run some errands. when i returned
    and they had left, i found evidence that they had gone through my belongings looking,
    i suppose, for things they wanted. the next day his son called and said they would
    be bringing my husband''s ex-wife over to load up the things they wanted before
    they went home. the day of the funeral his son called to inform me that they had
    brought a truck from arkansas to haul it all away. abby, i couldn''t take it any
    more. i said, "your daddy would be ashamed of you. to ask his widow on the day
    of his funeral to come over immediately afterward is incredibly crass." well,
    during the funeral, i observed his son''s grief, and now i feel terribly guilty
    for being a wicked stepmother. am i? also, is it in good taste for an ex-wife
    to pluck flowers from her ex-husband''s grave in front of his widow, before he
    is lowered into the ground? i''m appalled. -- grieving in missouri'

    i recently took a commercial airline flight home from england to the united states.
    regrettably, the woman i sat next to wore too much perfume. i don''t mind perfume

    will you please ask your readers to take a minute to think about how they treat
    people who are different or unique? these days we seem to care about how we treat
    people who are disabled or in a minority -- however, some of us seem to forget
    that all people should be treated with kindness, dignity and respect, regardless
    of who they are or what they do. my son is an elvis impersonator. now, i''m not
    talking about some clairvoyant who thinks he channels elvis; i''m talking about
    a talented singer who works hard at his profession of re-creating the elvis concert
    experience. he was even selected to be in a new film on impersonators called "almost
    elvis." but you would not believe the way some people treat him in public. although
    he doesn''t walk around in a jumpsuit, he must look the part with black hair and
    sideburns. it amazes and upsets me how rude and insensitive people can be with
    their smart remarks. if they stopped to think for a minute about the golden rule,
    about choosing to build up rather than tear down those around them, then we might
    have a little more kindness in the world. elvis was known for his kindness to
    strangers -- and i think we could all take a lesson from him. -- protective little

    each year, usually in december, you print letters about choosing appropriate gifts
    for the elderly. you have advised us against purchasing unwanted items such as

    have reminded us to stay clear of useless things for their homes, like vases or

    it happened again! my fiance, "greg," left me behind to spend another long holiday
    weekend with his family. let me give you the details. greg is 22 years old. he
    lives at home with his parents and goes to college. his parents have a lake cottage
    one hour away. they go there almost every weekend, and they expect greg to come,
    too. in fact, we go there almost every weekend. my sister''s birthday was during
    the labor day weekend. i invited greg to stay here and celebrate with us, because
    my sister lives five hours away, and we don''t get to see her that often. however,
    greg wanted to "spend time with his family." he insists i''m selfish for getting
    upset. i feel that i''m getting the "leftovers" and i''ll never be first in his
    life. another thing: greg has been wanting to get his own place, but changed his
    mind because his dad travels occasionally, and greg says he doesn''t want to leave
    his mother alone, even though he has two teen-age brothers who are still at home.

    i was struck by the letter from "missing them in colorado," who had moved to a
    new city and whose old friends ignored her attempts to remain in contact via correspondence.
    something similar happened to me. years ago i moved from pittsburgh to clearwater,
    fla. i kept in touch with my friends through letters and cards. after a time,
    the letters dropped off, but i continued to send cards for birthdays, anniversaries,
    christmas, births, etc. five years ago, six of my friends retired and moved here.
    i was delighted -- and we socialized at parties, dinners and sports events. gradually,
    they stopped including me in their get-togethers. in the meantime, i became friendly
    with one of the busboys at my favorite restaurant and his lovely family. he calls
    me "mr. r.," because i''m 72 and he is 20. he attends junior college at night.
    i''m always included at his family''s parties and dinners. he insists on cutting
    my grass each week and afterward invites me out to bowl or to a movie. he has
    become a dear friend. several months ago, i ran into one of my old friends and
    asked why i never hear from them anymore. his wife said, "wake up and smell the
    coffee. you can''t keep up with us timewise or financially." not too long after
    that encounter, i inherited a great sum of money. news gets around quickly, and
    guess who came out of the woodwork? the same couple called and invited me for
    dinner and said it would be nice to have me "back in the fold." i replied that
    my time is precious -- and besides, they could not keep up with me financially.
    i''ll continue to send cards on their special days, but i will concentrate on
    building my friendship with jose and his family. and guess who will be mentioned
    in my will? sorry this letter is long, abby, but i needed to vent. -- mr. r.,

    your suggestion that "used" charge her friend $60 a day to "cover the cost of

    to cost her the relationship with her friend. i''m from the southeast, and such

    simply talk to her friend? she could inform her that the annual visit makes it
    difficult for her family to maintain their somewhat strained weekly budget. she
    could suggest that, perhaps, they go grocery shopping together and then simply
    ask her friend to pay for part. if they run out of milk or need a video, she could
    ask her friend to go to the store for it. by being up-front with her friend, she
    may appear to be struggling financially, but her friend should appreciate her
    honesty. following your advice, she will appear rude and cheap. -- used to southern

    this is in response to "wounded in midland, texas," who was devastated because

    him. not only did i have to deal with the pain of losing him, but also the guilt
    of wondering what i could have done to stop him. at his funeral, several of our
    "friends" just had to share stories about his infidelities and drug habits with

    me then? losing someone causes enough pain; at least leave us with what happy
    memories we have. i, too, went through years of therapy and am now happily remarried

    a pregnant 18-year-old wrote to you because her husband was having a hard time
    accepting the fact that she wears a locket with a photo of the baby boy she gave
    up for adoption three years before. you advised her that you thought it was because
    the necklace "served as a constant reminder that ''he wasn''t the first man in
    her life.''" abby, that girl told you she had been raped and the baby she gave
    up was a result of a crime committed against her. how can you even insinuate that
    the heartless coward who fathered this child was a "man in her life"? i can assure
    you that a rapist, and the experience of being raped, becomes a permanent part
    of your life. however, when a child is raped, that rapist does not become the
    "first man in her life." i hope you will print this letter along with an apology
    for offending all victims of rape. -- tamie in marietta, ga.'

    in response to the young wife whose husband wants her to remove the locket containing
    the picture of the baby she gave up for adoption, my next question would be: how
    dare he? what does he want her to give up next -- her friends and family? if he
    can''t see that the locket is important to her, he may never see anything that
    is important to her. my feeling is that he''s using this as emotional blackmail
    because he is insecure in himself. i have had three children, and never loved
    any of them less than the others. is this husband an only child? if not, have
    him ask his mother if she loved any of her children less because she already had
    one. a parent''s heart is too big for something that petty, and "too young" has
    already proven how big her heart is. this young woman should hold her head up
    proudly, because her daughter will, too -- and so will her son. she has already
    proven what a terrific parent she is. she did not blame her unborn child and gave
    him the greatest possible gift, life! keep your locket, dear lady; you earned

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i could not disagree with you more strongly regarding your advice to "worried
    about my friend," who doesn''t want to be in her friend''s wedding. she told you
    she thought her friend''s fiance was abusive, and the marriage would be the biggest
    mistake of her friend''s life. you told her to be there for the bride on her big
    day and afterward, in case she had to help her pick up the pieces of her broken
    heart -- that''s what friends are for. abby, a friend should speak up when a friend
    is about to make a terrible mistake. most of us need help when making important
    choices. we may not see ourselves -- or people with whom we are in love -- as
    others do. we lack objectivity. in my opinion, a true friend values the friend
    over the friendship. risking the friendship for the sake of the friend can be
    an act of great love. anyone considering giving this kind of advice takes the
    risk of rejection, embarrassment or error. when making a decision to offer advice,
    one should ask: "is my decision made to help my friend? is it motivated by love?"
    you may be right, abby, that it''s unlikely anyone with wedding plans will listen
    to such advice, but it''s not impossible. some may listen. for the sake of those,
    i hope you will publish my letter. friends are not just for picking up the pieces
    of a broken heart. they are also for trying to catch that heart before it shatters
    on the hard pavement of a poor discernment process. -- (rev.) richard g. francesco,

    you reminisced in a recent column that we used to be more tolerant of each other.
    a reader, irma barragan, pointed out that we really were not all that tolerant
    -- and the "good old days" were not all that good for everyone. i feel you conceded
    her point far too easily. what has changed, regrettably, are our ideals. in some
    ways, we certainly were not as tolerant then as we are now. (after all, we have
    made some important progress since, say, 1964.) but we were headed deliberately
    in the direction of tolerance, of integration into the "melting pot." in those
    "good old days," when we noticed intolerance, we still believed that it would
    -- and should -- disappear with time. no more. as a country, we no longer aspire
    to be a melting pot. now we are satisfied with a patchwork of separate cultures,
    each with uneasy relations with everyone else: a balkanized society. i once heard
    a politician define himself as a "paleo-liberal" because he still believes in
    integration, not multiculturalism. that''s me: one of the melting pot liberals.

    in junior high school and high school, a knee injury left him with only swimming
    and dance for gym class choices. he endured a lot of razzing about his sexuality
    when he dressed to go to a dance class with the girls while all the other guys
    were preparing to do "manly" activities such as wrestling. finally, my brother
    lost his tolerance and pointed out, "you are going into a class of sweaty, smelly
    guys in shorts and sweatshirts. i''m going into a class with girls in skintight
    leotards and tights. who do you think is having a problem?" and that ended the
    discussion! as for cooking, my brother has always been the better cook in our
    family, and he loved it at an early age. to this day, he takes cooking classes
    and cooks up gourmet feasts out of nothing. the mother is correct to encourage
    her son''s interests. dancers are often in better shape than other athletes, and
    certainly the number of male chefs on tv and running restaurants shows there is
    nothing effeminate about cooking. someday, the other boys will realize that trevor
    actually has a lot of advantages they missed out on -- and they''ll be envious
    instead of harassing. -- proud sister, plano, texas'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    several years ago my husband''s sister asked us if we wanted an old schoolhouse
    bell she had purchased. she was moving and could not take it with her. because
    we like antiques, we accepted her offer. after much effort and paying to rent
    a moving truck -- the bell weighed 1,500 pounds -- my husband moved it to our
    house. it was so heavy he got it no farther than the top of our driveway, and
    there it sat for more than two years! it became obvious that the bell was just
    too large and heavy for us to do anything with. it would have cost us a small
    fortune to have someone build a stand for it, so i asked a local auctioneer if
    he could sell the bell for us. when my sister-in-law learned i had sold the bell,
    she had a fit! she thought i should have asked her permission to sell the bell,
    as she had considered the bell only on "loan" to us. i never considered a 1,500-pound
    item that we paid to move, sitting in my driveway for more than two years, a "loan."
    i''m angry that this has caused such a rift in my husband''s family. i was always
    taught that when you are given something, it is yours to do with as you please.
    my husband feels caught in the middle, and we are now having marital problems
    for the first time in our 14-year marriage. what do you suggest? -- melva in phillipsburg,

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    you recently printed a letter from a reader in chula vista, calif., regarding
    the "y2k hype." while it is indisputable that many are profiting through the y2k-related
    sales of merchandise, this is america and, like it or not, when people see a way
    to make a profit, they are free to take it. we are also free to choose what we
    purchase. thousands of people have gone to great lengths and expense to keep all
    services, many of which we take for granted, fully operational during the year
    2000 transition. they deserve a standing ovation for their backstage efforts.
    hopefully, the sources of any y2k-related problems will continue to be found quickly
    and repaired easily. both the red cross and fema have posted emergency preparedness
    articles on their web sites with practical as well as affordable suggestions for
    all climates. while i agree with the author of the "y2k hype" piece (i.e., "stay
    calm, don''t panic, use your head"), proper emergency preparedness can make a
    world of difference by relieving inconveniences and uncertainty until services
    are restored. it may even save a life. no one ever pencils in "possible date with
    an emergency" on one''s calendar, but it makes sense to do so. jan. 2, 2000, is
    on the calendar. why not consider making some preparations -- without the hype?
    since many of the people who need this information may not have access to it via
    the internet, here are a few tips from the red cross disaster y2k safety web site.
    i hope you''ll share it with your readers: -- stock supplies such as canned foods,
    bottled water, instant soups, etc., to last several days. -- in the event of a
    power outage, plan to use alternative cooking devices in accordance with the manufacturer''s
    instructions. never use liquid-fueled heating and cooking devices without adequate
    ventilation. -- organize your first aid supplies. this includes prescription as
    well as nonprescription medications. -- have plenty of flashlights and batteries
    on hand. (if you have small children, keep flashlights available for their personal
    use and safety.) do not use candles alone for emergency lighting. -- plan to use
    extra blankets, coats, hats and gloves to keep warm, not gas-fueled appliances
    such as an oven. -- listen to a battery-operated radio to keep yourself informed.
    be prepared to relocate to a shelter for protection or warmth if necessary. --
    check with the emergency service providers in your community before an emergency
    arises, particularly if you or a loved one has special needs. -- pamela ryan,
    wilmette, ill.'

    i''m writing concerning the letter from the woman who was hurt by the way her
    husband treated her 7-year-old son from a previous relationship. she said the
    boy''s father had no part in her son''s life. let me share my story. i was a child
    in a home with a stepfather, stepsisters and stepbrothers. my sisters and i could
    do nothing right; the other kids could do no wrong. i got pregnant at 19, and
    my boyfriend said he would marry me, but he "might just leave" in a year or two.
    i chose to go it alone. during my pregnancy, i lived at home and endured more
    verbal abuse from my stepfather. when my daughter was born, i went to work, paid
    my hospital and doctor bills and moved out. i resolved never to marry so my beautiful
    little girl would never endure what i had endured. and then along came "jack."
    he took us to movies, took us to play miniature golf; he took us fishing, and
    he won our hearts. when i agreed to marry him, his next words were, "let''s see
    what it would take for me to adopt ''michele.''" a year later, our other daughter
    was born. at no time in the past 28 years has anyone who did not know that michele
    was not jack''s child by birth, ever guessed it. she is his -- in his heart and
    soul. we all like to think we would risk our lives to save a stranger from a burning
    building or a car accident, but most of us will never get the chance. that woman''s
    husband has the chance to be a hero to her young son. it will not happen in one
    day or in one event. it will take every day for the rest of their lives. her husband
    can be a mentor, a teacher, a friend and a daddy -- or he can be a jerk. when
    the world talks about heroes, no one from my house needs to look beyond my husband.

    your response to "hurt in connecticut," who was bothered that family members didn''t
    attend her choir concert, was a very good one. family solidarity should be valued;
    however, it may be expressed in many ways. i, too, am a "singing grandmother"

    performance of the chorale in which my husband and i both sing. may i share the
    following thought process that helped us soften the disappointment? 1. consider
    the many other ways your sons, daughters and grandchildren demonstrate their love
    and respect throughout the year. 2. remember that they all have their own activities,
    goals and commitments, their own social needs and responsibilities. 3. remember
    how you felt at their ages. would you have had time to attend? would you have
    changed or abandoned your previous plans? 4. if you do not wish to accept an invitation
    to a sports event, glee club performance, etc., it''s ok to politely decline.
    5. finally, how would you feel if you were not invited to any of those "boring"
    events? i am honored when i''m invited to an awards banquet or graduation. (attendance
    is limited, you know.) singing in the chorale is a personal pleasure, which is
    enhanced whenever my family and/or friends are able to attend the performance.
    when they cannot, it is not a rejection. in other words, dear "hurt," count your
    blessings. i''m sure you''ll feel much better. -- california grandma'

    i grew up in a house full of siblings. our father told us he would not tolerate
    smoking, drinking or cursing under his roof, and if we wanted to do any of those
    things, we were free to move out. when i entered the air force in 1947, it wasn''t
    long before i was confronted with the old, "aw, come on -- have a drink. don''t
    be a stick-in-the-mud." i had several good friends who drank, but i had no desire
    to start. i finally came up with an answer that worked. i told anyone who asked
    me to drink or smoke a funny cigarette, "i''ll tell you what i''ll do: i won''t
    try to make you stop if you don''t try to make me start." in almost 13 years in
    the air force, it never failed me and i still had lots of friends. i still don''t
    drink or smoke that funny weed, and i am over 70 years old. abby, why can''t young
    people today use the same line to refuse alcohol, tobacco, drugs -- and maybe
    even sex? they might be surprised how they could influence some of their friends
    to stop. i''m proud to say i did. -- been there in texas'

    four years ago i moved to a new town where i knew one person from a previous job.
    over the years, our friendship has grown very close, and she has introduced me
    to many other people who have also become my friends. a few weeks ago, i dropped
    by my friend''s house on the spur of the moment and walked into a dinner/card
    party that included a group of these friends. i was very hurt and upset that i
    had not been invited. my friend is angry with me for being upset and insists that
    there is no reason to be hurt. the six people included are all couples. i am single

    i am the parent of an adult man who has down syndrome. he has many opportunities
    to be part of the community in addition to his job -- parties, weddings, going
    to stores, restaurants, movies, church. the problem? when we are greeting people
    or leaving an event, complete strangers will shake hands with everyone else but
    hug my adult son. they do not hug anyone else. however, they think it is just
    fine to hug him because he is "different." please, well-meaning folks, we parents
    and teachers and social workers work very hard so that our retarded adults can
    be accepted, productive members of the community. more important, though, is our
    real concern for their safety. we teach them to shake hands and greet others like
    "normal" people do. to be hugged by strangers is neither safe nor acceptable social
    behavior in our society. this behavior further sets our adult children apart as
    "they" and "people like that" when acceptance and inclusion is what is needed.
    it also confuses what we have been trying to teach. give them a job rather than
    a hug! is it safe for your children to hug strangers? do you hug strangers? it
    isn''t safe for my son either! so please, smile, shake his hand and make him feel
    welcome. that will do more for him than a hug that diminishes his chances for
    safe independence in the world. abby, i believe i speak for many parents of retarded
    adults, as we have discussed this problem often. thank you for getting this message

    in reference to the letter from the los angeles plastic surgeon regarding facial
    disfigurement of children who are allowed to stand in a moving car, may i add
    my 2 cents'' worth? i am a flight attendant for a major airline, and while the
    captain does not usually "jam on the brakes," we do hit unexpected turbulence.
    planes can drop 500 feet in a matter of seconds. guess where a small child who''s
    not in a seatbelt goes? to the ceiling! i write this out of sheer frustration
    with uneducated -- or perhaps lazy -- parents. the faa does not mandate that a
    child under the age of 2 be in his or her own seat. this is shameful and absurd.
    we, the flight crew, are required to ensure that all carry-on luggage is safely
    stowed, yet our most precious cargo, these little human beings, can be on an adult''s
    lap. i applaud parents who pay the extra money and purchase a seat for the child,
    and extra kudos when they bring along a car seat. if there is an extra seat available,
    i always move other passengers so "lap baby" can have his or her own seat, explaining
    to parents that it is safer. guess what? they give me a blank stare and say: "oh,
    she won''t sit still in her own seat. she''ll cry. i''ll just hold her." let me
    offer this graphic thought: parents, if the plane does crash and your baby is
    on your lap, the baby becomes a human air bag for you. your baby will die instantly.
    i had a passenger tearfully tell me that this happened to her. she is now crippled,
    and her only child (who would be 9 now) was killed. i urge all parents and grandparents
    to write to congress and insist that every passenger -- even babies -- be in a
    seat. the faa''s argument that families will not pay for the extra seat because
    the cost is prohibitive is unfounded. most airlines offer a lower rate for children.
    the faa says that people will turn to driving, which will cause more road accidents.
    this is conjecture. i know this letter is long, but please pass along this important
    message. believe me, it will be clipped by thousands of airline crews and shown
    to passengers. -- a concerned flight attendant'

    my wife and i have a dilemma over something that occurred at our wedding. we invited

    before the wedding and informed us that he would be picking up his son from college
    and bringing him to the wedding, too, "since he''s family and all." he said he''d
    be doing this because it would give the three of them time to spend together.
    given the late notice with which he called, we decided that it was simply too
    late to add another guest. i spoke with him the following day, and he agreed with
    us and said it was "no problem" to come without his son. to our surprise, however,
    while dancing at our reception, my new bride and i noticed the cousin''s wife
    and son dancing! we don''t know when he arrived or if he was there for the ceremony,
    cocktail party and/or dinner (however, no dinner was ordered for him and no place
    seating reserved). they never came over to speak to us during the evening, and

    i am writing in reference to a very short letter from "on the spot," who wanted
    to know what to say to nosy people who ask, "isn''t it about time you had kids?"
    when you aren''t planning on having any. your answer was on target; however, i
    think "on the spot" was really hinting at a much larger issue -- people assuming
    that everyone wants a spouse and/or children. my husband and i struggled with
    our decision not to have children for three years before his vasectomy. during
    that time, i began to dread the family get-togethers that used to mean so much.
    subtle hints and flat-out blunt questions were present in every holiday visit.
    this additional pressure was almost unbearable. finally, i decided enough is enough
    -- the next person to ask will get an honest answer instead of being "tuned out."
    my sister-in-law "marge" (who has a habit of speaking without thinking) asked,
    right before the birth of her second child, when she could send the maternity
    clothes to my house. i thought her jaw was going to break the way it fell to the
    floor when i said, "never" and changed the subject. i''ve found it''s a lot less
    stressful to speak my mind and make a few waves than to hold in my comments and
    feel my blood boil. i would like to remind people to think before they speak.

    eight years ago, the most beautiful woman in the world came into my life. i''ll
    call her "mary." we dated for seven months before she started asking for a proposal.
    i happily agreed, and in 1993 we were married. two years later, she convinced
    me that we should buy a house. a year after that, she said she wanted to have
    cats in our home. i don''t care too much for cats, but i gave in to two cats.
    then she started yearning for children. when we married, we both realized that
    she could not get pregnant. so she began inquiring into adoption. i wasn''t too
    fond of the idea of bringing a child into our home when we knew little about its
    medical or psychiatric history. again, to make her happy, i agreed. now don''t
    get me wrong -- not a day goes by that i don''t look at my son and thank god for
    him. then mary wanted to help us get ahead financially. we both agreed that she
    would be the one to return to college, since we could not afford to lose my income
    and my study habits are not great. so we struggled for two years to put her through
    school. after a while, mary started going out with her friends from school for
    a few hours. then the outings turned into all-nighters. keep in mind, my son and
    i were at home while she was out partying with money we couldn''t afford. eventually
    she confessed to me that she''d had a fling with a guy she met. i forgave her
    by telling her that six years was too much time to throw away over one mistake.
    two months ago, she told me she doesn''t want to be married anymore. she moved
    in with her mother. we alternate weeks with our son, but he has trouble staying
    with her. part of the reason may be that she yells at him for every little thing
    he does wrong. he''s only 5 years old. two days ago, she informed me that she''s
    moving to florida for an opportunity to attend school and have a good job. mary
    does not want our son to come with her. in fact, she says she doesn''t want him
    at all. sometimes she says she wishes she could take him back to the agency. abby,
    i gave my wife everything she wanted -- a house, an education, a son and plenty
    more. now she''s leaving me high and dry to cope with the responsibilities of
    paying the bills and being a parent. so much for deadbeat fathers. care to offer
    any advice? -- deserted in new orleans'

    i am 25 years old and have been happily married for three years. my husband is
    the man of my dreams. we are both hard-working and save most of our earnings to
    meet future goals. my problem is his mother and father mismanage their money terribly.
    throughout their lives, no matter how much money they made, they spent more. during
    the past 30 years, when they overspent on phone bills, dinners out, massages,
    etc., they would ask for money from her brother. recently my father-in-law took
    early retirement because he is in poor health due to years of smoking and poor
    diet. his entire pension was used to pay off their house and accumulated debts.
    if they had watched their spending, i believe they would have enough through social
    security and her paycheck to pay their bills -- yet they are still spending frivolously,
    acquiring new debt and asking us for money. this isn''t the first time they have
    asked and received at inopportune moments when we really needed the money ourselves
    -- such as just before our wedding and at christmas. as i was writing the most
    recent check a couple of weeks ago, my mother-in-law laughed and said, "if you
    think i know how to spend, you should see my friend ''mary''!" i thought to myself,
    we would all love to spend, spend, spend, but it shouldn''t be done unless one
    has the means. i want to be a fair person, but now every time i think of my in-laws
    i fear they are going to one day wipe us out. how can i prevent it? -- drowning

    i have a college friend who visits annually with her family. they''ve been coming
    in november, but we live in a small town and find it difficult to entertain them
    in the fall. so last november we suggested that, since there is a campground with
    a beautiful lake nearby, they camp here during the summer. they came this july,
    but were tired of camping after a two-week vacation, so they asked if they could
    stay at our home. there are six people in my family. my husband is a schoolteacher
    and i am unemployed. my friend has a family of four. both she and her husband
    have good jobs, and their annual income must be roughly twice what ours is. they
    don''t offer to help pay for groceries, even though we always run out of milk
    or bread while they''re here and they often go to the grocery store with us. we
    have gone out to eat with them, just so we won''t have to buy groceries for them.
    they always pay for their own meals, but never offer to treat us. last month,
    my family stayed with my sister for four days. we bought $50 worth of groceries,
    treated their family to pizza, bought them a videotape and gave them $15 in cash.
    we weren''t being generous; we just felt we were being fair. would it be wrong,
    the next time these friends tell us they are coming, to bill them $10 per day
    for meals? we''ve dropped so many hints we''re almost rude, but we feel, after
    15 years, it''s time they stopped taking advantage of us. we''ve stopped enjoying
    their visits and are afraid, now that they''ve come in the summer, they''ll begin
    visiting us twice a year. i''d like to tell them how i feel but have never had
    the nerve. am i being petty? -- used in the northwest'

    my family attends a local church, and we have made many friends within this congregation.
    however, there is one family in this congregation who wears out the welcome mat
    at our home, and i don''t know how to handle it without making enemies. for memorial
    day, we were having a picnic in our back yard with some friends. "mr. uninvited"
    drove by and, seeing that we had guests, "stopped in" and invited himself for
    dinner after asking, "what do you have for me to drink?" when a beer was offered,
    he responded, "oh, this cheap brand -- don''t you have anything else?" it upsets
    me that he has the nerve to invite himself when it is obvious that we''re having
    company and he was not invited. i would never do that to him. then, the insults
    we hear if we''re serving only hamburgers and hot dogs and not having surf and
    turf, really put the icing on the cake. he always comes "empty-handed," which
    does not improve the situation. this is a family of four. the father and son are
    the worst offenders. they are a middle-class family, like us, so it''s not a case
    of "he won''t eat tonight if i don''t feed him." in addition, they have never
    once invited us to their home. i have on several occasions made remarks, trying
    to drop the hint that they are not welcome to barge into my home on all occasions,
    but he just doesn''t "get it." i don''t want to make an enemy, but i cannot tolerate
    his rudeness anymore. any suggestions? -- needs help with the visitors'

    i recently watched a country music award given to two men. the first to speak
    hogged the mike, gabbed about his sick child at home, thanked everyone in the
    music business and then invited his partner to speak. as the other man approached
    the mike, the first remembered he hadn''t thanked his wife, shouldered his way
    back in and droned on about how many years they had been together, yadda-yadda-yadda.
    the partner looked sad as the music came up and they went to commercial. i felt
    angry that he wasn''t acknowledged and didn''t get to say a word or two. it happens
    so often, i wanted to comment. at every oscar, emmy, grammy, etc., award ceremony,

    i''d like to add another thought to "teacher who cares about the future," who

    put his desk out in the hall with the wet boots and coats, and another time had
    forced him to sit in a corner on a stool wearing a dunce cap. my son''s eyes had
    been tested by a specialist who examined each eye separately and said there were
    no vision problems. not true! just to be sure, i took him to another doctor, who
    tested his eyes together. sure enough, the eyes did not work properly together.
    was it any wonder he couldn''t do his school work? when he tried to read, the
    little fellow saw double, backward and blurred! fortunately, the doctor was able
    to help. today our son is a radio engineer with a large station and is a happily

    i am absolutely outraged. i am a young woman of 23 who was brought up by parents
    who knew my whereabouts every minute of the day until i was married. now, as the
    manager of a suburban fast-food restaurant, i am the supervisor and confidante
    to a number of fine teen-agers. these kids come from well-to-do homes, but their
    parents are totally irresponsible. my current pique stems from a robbery 10 days
    ago. i and two workers, both 17-year-old girls, were closing up late friday night
    when we were confronted by several armed men. the rules are strict: don''t resist.
    we didn''t. the three of us were taken into the back room, bound hand and foot
    with duct tape, gagged and left hog-tied on the floor. when the men left, we struggled
    but it was evident that we wouldn''t be able to break loose or go for help. my
    husband was working night shift and would not miss me -- but surely, i thought,
    the girls'' parents would come looking for them. as we huddled together, unable
    to do much more than mumble through the tape on our mouths, i listened for the
    sound of cars and the girls'' worried parents. i figured it would be an hour at
    worst. abby, they never came! the phone never even rang. workers arriving at 6
    a.m. found us still bound and huddling. we had spent the entire night tied up
    on the floor, and the girls were apparently not missed. at this point, i actually
    feel more anger toward the parents of these girls than for the men who robbed
    us. we were not hurt, and i can understand why it was necessary to tie us up.
    but what kind of parents are unaware when their teen-aged daughters are gone all
    night? i am ... bound and boiling in pennsylvania'

    many interests and is highly intelligent for his age. but his interests trouble

    regarding the letter you''ve printed concerning displaying the american flag,
    i bet no one can top this: i live in a new duplex-condo community. our association
    bylaws forbid any permanent structures of any kind on our front lawns. all the
    condos are exactly alike -- boring -- and this is meant to preserve uniformity.
    an 80-year-old retired army colonel, a veteran of world war ii, who walks with
    a cane due to an injury sustained during the war, recently moved into our neighborhood.
    he and his seriously ill wife had always flown the flag -- so he promptly installed
    a flagpole of the proper size and proudly raised one. he and his wife would sit
    in their front yard on summer evenings, and strollers would stop by to visit them
    and each other. it was a lovely time. however, not everyone socialized or appreciated
    his patriotism. more than half the residents deemed the flag "tacky" or inappropriate.
    an association meeting was held at which the colonel''s flag was discussed and
    voted on by the board. the colonel had prepared a stirring statement concerning
    what the flag meant to him, mentioning his war experiences. would you believe
    the board voted 5-to-3 against him? the old guy was defeated! the story has a
    semi-happy ending: the colonel agreed that whoever was willing to do it could
    come over and remove the flagpole, which had been set in concrete. abby, no one
    had the nerve -- and his flag still flies year-round. he still sits and visits
    with his friends on summer evenings; his wife died three months ago. -- p.h. in

    i just finished reading the letter from "a teacher who cares about the future."
    i was saddened when i read your comment that "extremely bright children may act
    out because they are bored." our society has reached a sad state when it excuses
    unacceptable behavior on the premise that it''s ok because of the so-called "brilliance"
    of the offending child. if a child is truly brilliant, he or she can learn to
    set limits, learn constructive things to do with his or her time, and continue
    to excel at his or her own rate without disturbing other children. my children
    range in age from 15 to 26. all have been considered "extremely bright" by their
    teachers. one tested brighter than any child ever tested by our school psychologist
    during academically talented testing in our school district. was she ever bored?
    yes, often. did she ever long for more challenges? i''m sure she did. did she
    ever, ever once act out in school? never! instead of acting out when she was little,
    she took extra books and projects to do in her spare time. a wise principal once
    told me to put her in dance and music classes -- and anything else in which she
    seemed interested. he said she needed to excel in many areas, or she could become
    bored in a few. i also volunteered regularly in her classrooms to give the teacher
    time to spend with other children on both ends of the academic spectrum. abby,
    limits need to be set and children need to be held to them. i am eternally grateful
    to the teachers who challenged each of my children to be the best that they could
    be. it has paid off handsomely. parents: stop blaming the schools and look in

    simple thank-you note or phone call. although my gifts are seldom acknowledged,
    i continue to send them out of a sense of obligation since they are my blood relatives.

    never admitted he was wrong about anything in the 13 years we''ve been married!
    he has never apologized for any thoughtless thing he''s done, has never acknowledged
    that anything he''s ever said has caused me pain or embarrassment, and refuses
    to admit that this isn''t normal. when i let him know this really bothers me,
    he''ll joke and say, "someday, if i''m ever wrong, i''ll apologize." i''ll admit

    this is in response to "jewish in cincinnati," who offered a litany of ways in
    which christians broadcast their religious beliefs. he or she should move to metropolitan
    new york where entire malls are closed every sunday because of "blue laws," and
    stores are closed on saturdays because of strict jewish beliefs. i give all of
    the aforementioned credit for honoring god. however, when "jewish in cincinnati"
    complains about christmas music blaring from october to january, let''s not confuse
    christianity with consumerism. half those offending stores and malls may not even
    be owned by christians. i grew up in an inner-city neighborhood in a small stretch
    of houses situated between a synagogue and a jewish school. every one of our neighbors
    had a strong sense of tolerance and caring. my grandma traded her italian pastries
    with our jewish neighbor for her delicious cheesecake. we manned the candy store,
    without thought of repayment, on high holy days for our jewish neighbor. on friday
    nights, my dad always turned off the lights at the synagogue. it seems to me that
    we were more understanding and tolerant in years past. what are we really learning
    from kosovo, or even littleton, colo.? so a comedian or celebrity needs to tell
    people he''s jewish. so what? it''s his shtick! in the meantime, if you''re traveling
    through hashbrouck heights, n.j., at christmastime, you''ll see my roman catholic
    church decorated with a nativity scene and a menorah. i think that''s what makes

    after one miscarriage and three years of infertility treatments, my husband and
    i are expecting twins. while i should be excited about this news, i''m not --
    for two reasons. i have a great relationship with my mother, who has agreed to
    come and help when the babies are born in september. my husband''s sister and
    family, who live out of town, are also thinking about coming to visit at that
    time. while i love my sister-in-law dearly, i don''t know that i will feel up
    to entertaining her family while trying to adjust to being not only a new mom
    but a new mom of twins. my husband has asked that i not alienate his family, but
    all i can think about is how tired and stressed i will be trying to adjust to
    the new lifestyle. my second dilemma is my mother-in-law. she''s a very pessimistic
    and paranoid woman whose family has allowed her to control every family situation.
    she never smiles, can''t find the joy in living, and tries to tell others how
    they should live their lives. i''ve asked my husband why he and his sister allow
    her to act this way. he says they''ve tried talking to her, but all she does is
    cry. abby, my mother-in-law is already providing me with unsolicited advice on
    how to take care of myself. i can just imagine what kind of unsolicited child-rearing
    advice i''ll get when the children are born. i don''t want to alienate my husband''s
    family, but under the circumstances i find it hard not to. any advice? -– dreading

    i''d like to comment on the letter from the person who wrote that as a hostess
    she was taken aback, stunned and hurt when her intended guest asked her what foods
    she would be serving at dinner. as a certified etiquette consultant for 10 years,
    let me say that it is actually the host''s responsibility, when inviting first-time
    guests to dinner, to ask when issuing the invitation, "is there anything you cannot
    eat?" the guest can then respond accordingly. it is not necessary for either one
    to mention allergies, foods restricted by culture or religions, dislikes for certain
    foods, dieting to lose weight, etc. the hostess can then plan the menu by not
    using the foods mentioned. this eliminates any surprises or embarrassment when
    the guests are already seated at the dining table. –- margit erickson, protocol/etiquette

    my boyfriend and i eloped last january. we arranged for a minister, rented the
    tux, got the gown, printed 300 announcements, and told everyone we were going
    on "vacation." we planned it for months and told no one. i''m 31 years old and
    had never been married. after the ceremony, we mailed the announcements and went
    about enjoying our honeymoon. we returned home to a house full of gifts and well
    wishes. both sets of parents were very pleased, and everyone couldn''t have been
    more supportive -- except for two people. ironically, they are the twosome who
    introduced us, my husband''s friend "morris" and his live-in girlfriend, "doris."
    they are no longer speaking to my husband and me because they are hurt that they
    were excluded from our plans. they feel we betrayed them and claim we lied and
    deceived them. a few nights before we left for florida, my husband was out with
    the "guys." morris pulled him aside and flat-out asked him if we were going away
    to get married. because our plans were private and not meant to be shared until
    after we returned from our trip, my husband told him "no." i hate to lose a friendship

    i am an 81-year-old male senior citizen and would like to comment on the letter
    that mentioned nude beaches. i am very familiar with them and also with nudist
    camps. nudism must be good for the eyesight because i have never seen a blind
    nudist. a nudist camp is where married couples air their differences and, when
    they disagree, they barely speak. as a matter of fact, one married couple broke
    up because they were seeing too much of each other. did you know that nudists
    peel first and get sunburned afterward? a lawyer joined a nudist colony, and he
    hasn''t had a suit since. one nudist was picked up as a suspect, but the police
    had to let him go because they couldn''t pin anything on him. i visited a nudist
    colony one time and, as i drove in, i stripped my gears. the only other time i
    had anything to do with nudism was when i stayed at a nudist lodge. (i think it
    was called the bareskin lodge.) there were no clothes closets and all of the rooms
    had sudden exposure. it was a short vacation. i was soon asked to leave because

    i have enjoyed your column for years. thanks for the entertainment each day. you
    do a great job. abby, this is the first time i have written to you, and it''s
    because i disagree with your answer to "concerned friend." the reader was concerned
    that a friend was unhappy because he was single. she said he was too shy to discuss
    his feelings with her. if that''s true, how does she know he''s unhappy? i think
    the reader is projecting her feelings onto her friend. as a single person, i want
    my friends to respect me enough to trust that i know what i want from my life.
    she should give her friend some dignity and realize that if he wants a relationship,
    he''ll pursue one. if he wants his married friends to fix him up, he''ll tell
    them. you suggested that the reader subtly invite some single females to their
    group activities. please, abby, he would know exactly what she''s doing. as a
    "single," i would find it awkward and embarrassing. in my circle of friends, some
    of us are couples and several of us are single. however, my friends respect me
    enough to leave to me the connecting up with someone if i want that. why must
    people assume that unmarried people are miserable because of their single status?
    most of my single friends have homes, careers, hobbies and extended families they
    enjoy. i know people who try to fix us up are trying to help, but we don''t need
    matchmakers. what we need are friends who love and respect us just as we are.

    like so many of those who write to you, i have been involved for quite a while
    with a married man who keeps making promises about our future together, but those
    promises are never kept. the difference is, this one is married -- to a corpse.
    she''s been dead for 2 1/2 years, and he still can''t let go and get on with his
    life. for almost a year, he promised we''d spend a weekend together; however,
    by thursday, he always had a reason to cancel. when we finally did get together
    for a weekend, he walked out and got another motel room where he and the ghost
    could spend the night together, while i cried my eyes out alone in the king-size
    bed in my room. do you have any idea how much rejection there is in learning that
    the man you love would rather sleep with his memories than with you? i finally
    persuaded him to get counseling, but he''s still doing the same things: promising
    we have a future together, then squelching any plans for physically consummating

    i worked for civil rights in the ''60s. my 10-year-old daughter grew up in a racially
    mixed church, a racially mixed neighborhood and a racially mixed school. she has
    studied the history of slavery, hitler, and other examples of what bigotry can
    do to a society, a country and the world. i have taught her from a very young
    age that bigotry is wrong, period. at the tender age of 10, she has already lost
    friends because she will not tolerate racist remarks. i have patiently tried to
    explain why racism was tolerated in the past in various societies. a few days
    ago my daughter asked me a question i could not answer. "mom, why is it ok to
    be a racist if you''re black?" she went on to cite examples of racist remarks
    at her school, in the media, by politicians and on tv. as i thought about it,
    she is correct. today''s america does tolerate, and in a few cases, even encourages
    blacks to be racist against whites. we wonder why there is violence in our schools.
    we despair over the white supremacist movement. we call for closer family support
    and guidance. why do we not cry out against racism wherever it may be found? how

    i have a bit of advice i''d like to give to "lucky in connecticut." keep your
    own health file. after every visit to the doctor for a complete physical, pap
    smear, mammogram, ultrasound, mri, etc., ask -- no, tell your doctor that you
    want a copy of the results. it is your right! you''ll probably have to sign a
    waiver, that''s all. then compare your test results from visit to visit. it is
    amazing what you can learn from your blood panel results. abby, you were right
    when you said there is an overwhelming ratio of patients to doctors. patients
    must ask questions. that is also their right. of course, all of us want our doctors
    to treat us as though we are their one and only patient. unfortunately, we must
    lower the pedestal we once had them on to a more realistic level. we cannot put
    all our faith in them -- we must help them out. oh, by the way, patients should
    make sure the names on the test result forms are theirs. here''s a little incident
    that happened to me: last february, i was admitted for major surgery (a complete
    hysterectomy). i was next on the list, and a young woman called my last name.
    we sat at her desk and she said, "have you ever been here before for this surgery?"
    "no," i replied, "if i had, i wouldn''t be here now." she said, "oh, you''d be
    surprised. some people come back three or four times." i said, "you''re kidding!"
    she said, "no." we both looked at each other with that quizzical look and i said,
    "what''s the first name on that form?" the first names were different, of course.
    the person whose file was in her hands was going to have foot surgery! could you
    imagine? my middle name was about to become "ooops!" i have kept my own file now
    for about 15 years and only wish i had started sooner. i guess my middle name
    back then was "naive." -- informed now in west bloomfield hills, mich.'

    my husband was downsized from a large company 16 months ago. he collected unemployment
    for six months, then began a business that he runs from our home. i have been
    the sole support of our family during this period. recently he began taking a
    class near his former office. his class began in the morning and ended at 2 p.m.
    when he returned home one evening, i asked him how his day had gone. he stated
    that he had gone to lunch with a lady from his old office. (she happened to call
    him last week for someone''s phone number and mentioned that "no one ever takes
    her to lunch.") my husband generously offered because he was going to be in the
    area the next week. he never mentioned it during the week prior to what i call
    "his date." his class needed to work through lunch, so he called her to tell her.
    she offered to wait for him and have a late lunch when his class was over. he
    called her on my cell phone before the end of class to say he''d pick her up.
    this was at 1:30 p.m. he picked her up at his former office, and they drove to
    an expensive restaurant because "he didn''t want to run into any former co-workers
    from his old company." as he told me this story, i started to get angry because
    he had told me the previous day that we could not go out to eat because money
    was tight. when he saw i was getting angry, he jokingly said he had just made
    up the story to see my reaction. i decided to check it out by looking for a receipt
    from the restaurant that he originally stated he had gone to. i found it in his
    wallet and saw that his first story had been the correct one. looking back, i
    now realize that he cleaned his car -- something he never does -- in preparation
    for this date, borrowed my cell phone to confirm the date, and was unusually concerned
    about his appearance before going to this class that day. he thinks i''m out of
    line for being upset that he took this divorced "friend" to lunch. he says i''m
    jealous. i feel used and disrespected since he kept the date a secret, picked
    her up for the lunch and then lied about it. what do you think? -- angry wife'

    my mother passed away more than seven years ago, and on her deathbed she asked

    is my very best friend and i need to honor my mother''s request. my sister is
    now engaged, and we are in the process of planning the wedding of her dreams.
    she is paying for most of it, and we''re having a lot of fun. everything went

    town. (i''ll be 12 hours away.) shortly after my mother''s death, my father remarried
    a woman his age who had never been married before. my brothers and sisters have
    accepted her into the family and been pleasant to her, although we do not consider
    her a "mother figure." we were all grown professionals at the time of my mother''s
    death. during the past several years, she has been critical and judgmental about
    various family dilemmas and has tended to "pout" if she didn''t get her way. when
    i mentioned my intention to host a bridal shower to my father''s wife, she led

    she wanted to host the shower. we have tried to tell her that this is not appropriate.

    about the shower. my father told me it''s causing problems in his marriage. my

    my boyfriend and i have been together for two years. we live together. i am 29

    have funeral insurance, so the costs for everything rested on the two of us. while
    he has two older sisters and one older brother, two of them didn''t even come
    to the memorial service or help pay for the funeral costs. we chose to have her
    cremated. we had very little money at the time, but a minister friend of mine
    held a lovely church memorial service in her honor, and my father held the repast
    at his home. my divorced parents made sandwiches and drinks for my boyfriend''s
    family, and one of my boyfriend''s sisters graciously paid for 75 percent of the
    cremation costs. a few days after the service, his sister returned home and his
    mother''s ashes were left with us. none of the children want them, and for the
    past year my boyfriend has stored them in our bedroom closet. i am uncomfortable

    why do people assume that happiness comes only with a relationship or marriage?
    i am a 24-year-old, happy, successful mother who enjoys the single life. i loved
    my son''s father very much but things did not work out for us, and he hasn''t
    been around for three years. i work at least 50 hours a week at my dream job,
    and enjoy my evening and weekend time with my 5-year-old son. however, everywhere
    i go i hear how i "need" someone, or people ask how i can stand to sleep alone
    every night. (i love it!) i have been told by men wanting a relationship that
    it is "unnatural" to prefer being single and that my son "needs" a father. abby,
    my son is well-adjusted and has a grandpa and two uncles he spends a lot of time
    with. my parents have a wonderful loving marriage after 34 years, and i think
    that''s great, but it is also unusual in this day and age. i may marry someday,
    but right now i''m enjoying the time with my son and an occasional date. why can''t
    people understand that? -- alone and loving it in missouri'

    i am a clergyman, and over the course of my 32 years in ministry, i have officiated
    at hundreds of weddings. i can''t tell you the number of times the bride has gotten
    tangled up in her wedding gown, or tripped up the aisle or lost her veil. some
    of them appear so awkward, and it''s sad to see them floundering around in billows
    of fabric. as the wedding season is upon us, may i suggest that bridal shops give
    brides some pointers about the dress they will wear. there must be techniques
    they can learn for their important day so they don''t end up looking so silly.
    and is it possible for brides to practice at home so that they learn how to maneuver
    the dress? -- reverend in n.j.'

    my father died 20 years ago. during his final illness my mother purchased two
    side-by-side cemetery plots in the town in which i grew up. my mother still lives
    there, although some of us kids have moved out of state. i am writing because
    after 20 years, my father still does not have a gravestone. as a veteran, he got
    a military marker, but that''s not a gravestone, and it''s sinking into the ground.
    since mom is still with us, is the gravestone any of my business? (she has not
    remarried.) i have kept my mouth shut for almost two decades now, but i feel this

    i am having a struggle with my parents. i am 25 years old and still living at
    home. i started seeing a man about a year ago. my parents objected to this for
    many reasons. he is 12 years older than i am, and they say his limited educational
    background could bring me down socially, which would lead to a thousand other
    problems. they seemed to be very concerned about how we would be perceived as
    a "couple." neither of these things has been an issue for this man or for me.
    well, my father began placing restrictions on the amount of time i spent with
    this man. i had to be home by 12:30, and if i wasn''t, my parents would track
    me down via cell phone. i could not go to this man''s apartment because what would
    people say? i finally got fed up and reminded my parents that i''m an adult, capable
    of making my own decisions. abby, i have always been there for my family, always
    sacrificed my time for all of them. i went to college to uphold the family name
    and made something of myself so the family would be proud of me. now i don''t
    know what to do. i love this man and want to see if we have a future. i see no
    harm in testing the water. but my parents are impossibly stubborn, and once they
    believe they are right, it would take an act of god to change their minds. i know
    it''s hard for parents to let go, but i feel they won''t even give me the benefit
    of the doubt. i would welcome any advice you can offer. -- hurting in illinois'

    i hope it''s not too late to offer a suggestion to "looking for privacy," whose
    in-laws copied their house key and used it as they saw fit. do not key the locks
    on all your doors alike. with an attached garage, i changed the lock on only the
    garage side door and gave that key to my in-laws to keep. however, they do not
    have the key to get into my home from the garage; i leave that door unlocked only
    if i expect them. sound controlling? perhaps, but i realized that if my mother-in-law
    had no qualms about barging into our bedroom and jumping into our bed (so we could
    all snuggle and watch tv), there were no measures too extreme to ensure our privacy

    the letter from "time to move on" was right on! her statement, "remember the real
    clutter is in her head," sums up my 20 years of observing chronically disorganized
    people. i have come to the conclusion that disorganization is always a symptom
    of something else going on in the disorganized person''s life. from hidden health
    problems to grief over the loss of a loved one, from political sniping at work
    to power struggles at home, and from a sense of helplessness, the amount, quantity
    and -- would you believe? -- the shape of the mess signifies what is really going
    on. sometimes it''s relatively simple, but many times it requires treatment at
    the root, not just a straightening up of the "symptom." many beginning organizers
    call me for advice, and i always caution them to take classes in psychology, and
    then refer difficult cases to a therapist or counselor. much harm can be done
    by untrained people who don''t understand why people "experience panic attacks
    as i peel away ... clutter" (to paraphrase from "time to move on"). please tell

    i can understand the distress of "distraught husband" who has to live along with
    his wife''s mess, but i am not sympathetic when "time to move on" describes tackling
    her mother''s house and its "three decades of clutter." why would a daughter put
    an elderly woman through panic attacks to satisfy her own sense of orderliness?
    my mom acknowledges her obsession with keeping five-plus decades of items. her
    house is stuffed with objects, making most of the rooms unlivable. but as long
    as she''s comfortable and safe, has her garden to putter in, and her countless
    unfinished craft projects to return to when she wishes -- who is the clutter harming?
    we tried to tackle some of the clutter when my dad was alive. we kids, all adult,
    finally decided that our mother''s remaining years need not be made more difficult
    by clearing out the house, and we would not raise her blood pressure or endanger
    her health by doing it over her objections. we''ll have plenty of time to do it

    may i comment on the letter from "frustrated doc"? as a pharmacist, i see the
    medical profession developing a new dimension -- generating reports and filling
    out insurance forms. often attention is diverted to completion of a form. believe
    me, there is nothing uniform in claims submission. imagine 31 ways of submitting
    a claim for a prescription. (or suturing a finger and completing a claims report.)
    on dec. 31, 1998, pcs (a prescription card) canceled all prescription coverage
    for federal employees for one day. i could fill a thick book with similar experiences.
    perhaps the next time your readers have a prescription filled, they will understand
    why the pharmacist has his attention centered on an insurance claim, or the reason
    you see six to 10 people in a doctor''s office struggling with claims. members
    of the medical profession would be happy to spend their time working with patients
    and skip the insurance claims -- but we have families to feed. if you can get

    you missed the mark on your advice to the bald boater''s wife. her husband doesn''t
    need a video to show him that he''s bald. he knows it, and would probably regard
    a video shoved in his face as another disparaging insult that we bald guys are
    used to. abby, his wife should be supportive, positive and encouraging. from the
    tone of her letter, it appears her approach has been the opposite. i can almost
    hear her saying, "your hair looks terrible that way." a more positive approach
    might help him feel more comfortable about trying a more realistic solution to
    his baldness. perhaps she should say, "honey, i think you''d look very sexy in
    a buzz cut." i had a "comb-over" years ago. it got to the point that it was inconvenient
    to style, difficult to keep in place and ineffective to the point of looking ridiculous.
    i was aware that it didn''t produce the effect i wanted, but i mistakenly thought
    it was better than nothing. finally, after i read a poll in which women named
    the sexiest man on television, i accepted the fact that there''s nothing wrong
    with being bald. do you know who they chose? patrick stewart, the totally bald
    captain who starred in "star trek, the next generation"! (he''s also a much-admired
    shakespearean actor.) the compassion, poise, strength and charm he conveyed were
    more meaningful to female viewers than his lack of hair. if a man possesses those

    less than two weeks ago, i lost a friend of more than 40 years. he had been in
    poor health for the better part of two years and succumbed to the many complications
    of emphysema. he left a wife and two adult children. the evening before the funeral,
    there was a viewing that was attended by many friends and relatives. at that time,
    his sister told the widow she would like to take some pictures of the floral arrangements,
    some of which were sent by relatives in the midwest. she wished to send these
    relatives some pictures. she was given permission, as long as she took only snapshots
    of the flowers, and not the open casket. the sister-in-law agreed to abide by
    this. the grieving widow had no sooner left the room than the deceased''s sister
    proceeded to take snapshots of her brother in the open casket! at the graveside
    service the next morning, she also took snapshots of the people attending the
    service, and even went so far as to take pictures of the casket as it was being
    lowered into the ground. when the widow learned of it later, she was furious.
    she called her sister-in-law the following day and expressed shock and disappointment
    that anyone would commit such a morbid, insensitive and uncaring act. the sister-in-law
    rationalized that the pictures were her own personal memento of her brother --
    since he looked so good, better than she had seen him look in a long time. the
    widow demanded the exposed roll of film, for which she offered to reimburse her
    sister-in-law, but was refused. abby, what do you think of this? should the sister-in-law
    have taken those pictures? -- one who has lost a friend'

    i have never written to you before. yesterday, i completed jury duty, having served
    six days. i had the honor to serve on the jury of a murder trial. on a positive
    note, my fellow jurors and i were treated very well. every effort was made to
    keep us comfortable. the judge was fair and impartial. the experience was interesting
    and educational, and i was proud to be part of the american judicial system. on
    the negative side, i was extremely disappointed and quite disgusted with the attitudes
    of virtually everyone outside the court. the first day, about 200 potential jurors
    showed up. i overheard numerous conversations of people scheming to get dismissed.
    once the jury was selected, most people asked why i didn''t try to get out of
    it. my boss (i work full time) was upset and worried that things wouldn''t get
    done. my co-workers were upset they would have to fill in while i was out. all
    but a few members of my family seemed annoyed and worried about how my jury duty
    would inconvenience my spouse and my children. all this when the defendant''s
    future was at stake. i didn''t mind the inconvenience because i truly believe
    it is my duty and honor to serve when called to do so. it troubles me that so
    many "average" people try to get out of serving jury duty. i was made to feel
    almost ashamed that i wanted to serve. if i don''t do it, who is left to serve?

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    will you take one more comment about children at weddings? traditions defining
    many public ceremonies arose in times when the only public record was the public
    recollection. centuries ago, before publicly recorded deeds secured property owners''
    rights, buyers and sellers would gather witnesses, including 10 small boys, and
    define the boundaries before exchanging a bag of gold for a symbolic clump of
    dirt. the men would then beat the boys to fix the transaction in their memories.
    this provided witnesses able to attest to the land sale covenant in the event
    a dispute arose, even decades later, in spite of limited life expectancies. i
    discovered this fact while researching land sales during law school. it is my
    understanding that weddings included children for similar reasons. celebrations,
    parades through the streets and processions into the church provided a positive
    reinforcement to the memories of the young children included to preserve a good
    public "record" of the marriage covenant. modern ring bearers and flower girls
    apparently represent a remnant of this tradition. if correct, the tradition explains
    why such participants should be old enough to be cognizant, but otherwise very
    young. regardless of the reasons, sniffling, giggling, chattering children, missing
    their cues in the procession or fidgeting among the witnesses, remind me that
    some element of the family and community can attest to the vows long after the
    other witnesses and i are gone. in my opinion, a ceremony that excludes children
    misses the point of a public ceremony. -- benjamin pitts, chattanooga, tenn.'

    i have read and enjoyed your wisdom, humor and honesty for many, many years and
    have always been impressed with your openness to different points of view. in
    that spirit, i offer mine: i''m writing in response to the plight of "sara," whose
    friends are angry with "sam," a new boyfriend who beats her. at a party, the hostess
    wanted to attack sam for this behavior, but feared this would cause him to beat
    sara even more, so the guests were polite and did nothing. you replied that you
    would have done likewise for the same reason. you advised the hostess to tell
    sara she doesn''t have to tolerate sam''s abuse, that he won''t change without
    counseling and to leave the relationship. as a retired marriage and family counselor,
    may i offer a different perspective? the problem here is not sam so much as sara,
    who, i''m sure, knows already what you advised her friends to tell her. the fact
    that she can''t take care of herself is the real issue. personal counseling and
    attending codependents anonymous would help her disarm what appears to be an inner,
    self-destructive refusal to take action on her own behalf. by complaining to her
    friends while doing nothing herself, she has initiated a "game" of what eric berne
    called "ain''t it awful?" here are the rules: friends suggest and cajole, sara
    admits they are right -- but does nothing. each beating makes the friends angrier
    and sara a more dramatic victim. the game continues until the friends tire or
    sara changes. the issue is really not sam, villain though he is, because he, too,
    is only acting out what he believes is appropriate in relationships. i hope sara
    and sam find the strength to seek the help they both need. -- howard d. bott,

    my mother insisted i read the letter from "married (really!)" -- it was fantastic!
    six weeks ago, i replied, "in a heartbeat," when the love of my life asked me
    to marry him. my engagement ring is a diamond-shaped turquoise stone set in sterling
    silver. it''s a native american piece we found in our favorite antique shop. i
    can''t begin to tell you how proud i am of it, what it means to me, and how special

    silver and turquoise was the natural choice. an apache legend says that if you
    follow a rainbow to its end and dig in the wet earth, you''ll find precious turquoise.
    so my comment to anyone who questions the significance of my "rock" is: "diamonds

    i''m a 46-year-old woman who married a 41-year-old man in january of this year.
    it''s my second marriage and his first. he hasn''t told me he loves me since the
    day we were married. when i share my needs with him, he doesn''t respond in a
    reassuring way. he usually gets hurt or mad, and ignores me as if he''s the injured
    party. among other issues, here''s the clincher: he has not told his parents or
    other family members that we are married. we both told my parents about the engagement
    and that we were being married in a private ceremony. (my parents didn''t really
    understand that part.) his excuse for not telling his parents is that he wants
    to make sure our marriage works, plus he doesn''t want to hear any negative feedback.
    however, his mother has introduced me to others as her "future daughter-in-law."
    also, he wanted a "private and confidential" marriage. i went along with it because
    he promised me we would have a church wedding and a honeymoon in about a year.
    recently he has started saying he no longer wants another ceremony, claiming,
    "we''re married and it''s a done deal." i feel our wedding vows of "love, honor
    and cherish" are all a big lie. i feel he''s dishonoring me by not telling his
    parents. he''s leading them to believe we''re living together in sin. he is also
    talking about his first love when he was 17, and a recent crush that a 20-year-old
    young woman at work has on him. he wants to buy her a card and a rose for her
    birthday. i thought that was a gift for someone with romantic intentions. it hasn''t
    even been six months, and already our marriage is a disaster. i know the first
    year is difficult, but this is just too much. i''m so hurt. i''m torn between
    honoring my marriage vows and calling it quits. what should i do? -- hurt and

    the letter from "distraught husband" struck a chord with me, a daughter who finally
    took action to clean up the clutter that had overtaken my mother''s life. until
    last christmas, my mother had never experienced having her many grandchildren
    gather around her table for a meal because she wouldn''t allow anyone into her
    home. two years ago, i moved in with my daughters and we began the seemingly endless
    task of cleaning her house -- repainting, repairing, reupholstering and relandscaping.
    in the process, i found a fortune underneath piles of trash in a room she had
    forbidden me to enter. she experienced panic attacks and very real terror as i
    peeled away three decades worth of clutter. now, two years later, mother has a
    regular cleaning lady, a gardener, a lawyer, an accountant and a stockbroker to
    manage the estate left by her parents. she has a beautiful home and enough money
    to travel around the world. we''ve had family gatherings, brunches for friends
    and neighborhood parties. don''t you just love happy endings? well, think again.
    there''s no happy ending here. the truth is, mother doesn''t know how to function
    without the security blanket her clutter provided. she''s angry with me for "ruining
    her life" and complains about me in outrageous terms to anyone who will listen.
    at the same time, she''s overly dependent upon me and wants me involved in every
    aspect of her life. i know mother needs help and suffers from age-related physical
    and mental problems, but i just can''t take it anymore. the best advice i can
    offer "distraught husband" is to get psychological counseling as a couple, before
    you begin tackling the cleanup. this is important, not only for her welfare, but
    to protect you from any false accusations that may come from her confused state
    of mind. remember: the real clutter is in her head, and will still be there long
    after you clean up the house. -- time to move on'

    recently one of my dearest friends, "mary helen," was forced to perform cpr on
    her brother "bill" when he collapsed at their parents'' home. unfortunately, bill
    died, and mary helen was left wondering if she had somehow performed the cpr incorrectly.
    right after the funeral, a "friend" interrogated mary helen about the precise
    method she used during the cpr. this "friend" then announced that mary helen had
    done it wrong, confirming her worst fear -- that she was responsible for bill''s
    death. needless to say, she took the news very hard and blamed herself. several
    weeks later, a doctor told mary helen her brother had been suffering from a form
    of heart failure. unfortunately bill had mistaken his symptoms for the flu. after
    much discussion, the doctor insisted that mary helen had performed the cpr correctly,
    and even if bill had been in the hospital, his death was inevitable. abby, please
    tell those well-meaning individuals who judge those of us who "fail" at performing
    cpr to hold their tongues. we don''t need a guilt trip. my cpr efforts failed
    when my husband had a heart attack several years ago. i was 31 years old when
    i performed cpr with all my might in my nightgown on the floor of our bedroom
    while our small children slept down the hall. there are people who wondered aloud
    if i had done everything i could to revive him. mary helen and i already know
    what it is to lose sleep asking ourselves: "did i count the breaths wrong? should
    i have pushed harder or faster? is it my fault he died?" the death of a loved
    one is hard enough -- but it''s even worse when you''ve tried to do everything
    right, and someone says you did something wrong, implying the death was your fault.

    i have been married for a year to a wonderful man whom i dated for several years
    before we married. we have just decided to start a family. here''s the problem:
    my husband insists i use his father''s practice as my obstetrical team. he thinks
    i should see one of his father''s partners during the pregnancy and have his father
    assist during the delivery. to give you a little background, his father works
    in a practice with other doctors. only one of the other doctors takes "call,"
    and this is done only part time. that means my father-in-law is on call about
    50 percent of the time and is the person contacted if an emergency arises or labor
    starts. also, other family members work in his office and have access to all the
    medical records. i feel extremely uncomfortable that my husband is trying to dictate
    what doctor (or practice) i use, especially since these are the most private examinations
    performed. i feel as though i should be able to use a doctor with whom i''m 100
    percent comfortable. i feel very uncomfortable using his father''s practice for
    numerous reasons: 1. i really need privacy and to be 100 percent honest with my
    practitioner, and i know i couldn''t be in that office, as everyone will probably
    read the records. 2. my father-in-law has asked me questions about pap smears
    in front of other family members and brought a blood test of mine home from his
    office and laid it on the kitchen table for all to see. 3. i want to be able to
    make the decision about who i use as my obstetrician. this is causing a lot of
    stress in my marriage. my husband says if i don''t go to his father''s practice,
    his family will be "crushed." i then asked him what was more important, my feeling
    comfortable with my practitioner throughout my pregnancy or his need to please
    his parents. i got no response. this whole topic is really creepy, if you ask
    me. abby, what are your thoughts on this? -- uncomfortable'

    may i remind people that there are single fathers who care for their children?
    most people seem to think that only mothers have custody of young children. believe
    me, a number of single fathers are raising their children. a few years ago, i
    took my 20-month-old daughter into the men''s room to change her diaper. on the
    way in, i saw a woman look at me in shock and horror that i was taking a baby
    girl into the men''s room. another customer had a different reaction. she said,
    "isn''t that sweet! her father is taking care of her." i wanted to shout: "no,
    it''s not sweet. she is my daughter and i love her. i am not trying to be ''sweet.''
    i am trying to take care of her and raise her with morals, feelings for others,
    and the ability to stand on her own two feet someday and contribute to society."

    this is in response to the man in fort lauderdale who sweeps his hair over his
    bald spot and embarrasses his wife with his foot-long "flag" of hair streaming
    in the breeze when they go boating. i can''t believe your answer about consulting
    a hair stylist or visiting a specialist about a hair transplant operation or getting
    a hairpiece. did it occur to either of you that the simple solution is to buy
    him a sporty yachting cap -- you know the kind, with the gold braid? it will work.

    card, a generous check, and a copy of your "keepers" booklet. it was terrific.

    i am an attractive, college-educated woman. for the past 18 months, i have been
    living with my boyfriend, "john," an attorney in a four-man firm. about six months
    ago, one of his partners threw a large, formal dinner to celebrate an important
    firm victory. although i had met this partner and his wife (i''ll call them mel
    and alice) many times, and they knew we lived together, the invitation came addressed
    to "john doe and guest." at the dinner, john was greeted warmly and introduced
    to the other guests, an assortment of accomplished and well-known local socialites.
    i was barely acknowledged and was left standing alone as john was escorted around
    the room. at dinner, i was seated at alice''s table. she never addressed a single
    comment to me, nor did she acknowledge any of my attempts to join the conversation.
    later, alice approached each of the other ladies and invited them to join her
    for a tour of her beautiful home. she left me standing in the living room alone
    with the men. the snubbing was so pointed that later others commented on it to
    john. being socially shy and insecure anyway, i was devastated. john and i are
    being married soon. i do not want this nasty woman at my wedding. even more, i
    do not want to give alice the chance to snub me again by declining my invitation.

    that they are christian with lights, wreaths, crosses and nativity scenes. he

    that "curious" try to buy something from christian-owned businesses on a sunday
    when they are the only stores closed in the mall. imagine how other religious

    you recently printed a list of signs of teen-age drug abuse. although the list
    is valuable for parents, you should know that a majority of those signs could
    also be signs of sexual, physical or emotional abuse. out of the 11 warning signs,
    i exhibited nine as a teen-ager, and i wasn''t using drugs. i had been twice molested
    as a child by two neighbor boys. my family didn''t talk about it because a psychiatrist
    told my parents not to bring it up. during my teens, i struggled with my sexuality
    and insecurities brought on by the abuse. i was embarrassed and felt dirty. i
    was in terrible emotional pain and had no one to talk to. my parents knew i was
    depressed but didn''t know how to approach me. they accused me of having an "attitude"
    problem. i was desperate for help, but had no way of asking. i was able to get
    past being a teen-ager, but i was angry at my parents for not recognizing i needed
    help. i came from a close family with parents who cared very much for me. there
    were many good times, but i had a deep sadness that never fully went away. it
    affected my entire family. i would urge parents to stop and consider: could your
    child be acting out for other reasons than drugs? could your child be crying out
    for help? when approaching your child, be careful not to accuse. be understanding.
    ask questions. if your child refuses to talk to you about personal things, consider
    seeking professional help. this help is as much for you as it is for your child.
    generally, if a child is acting out or using drugs, it''s a family problem. even
    the best families can have a breakdown of communications. there''s no such thing
    as a "perfect" teen-ager or a "perfect" parent. it''s ok to ask for help. -- been

    every time i pick up a newspaper, or see on the evening news a story about "road
    rage," i can''t help but fear that my husband could be the next victim. "alex"
    is an otherwise intelligent, caring individual who becomes the terror of the highway
    whenever he gets behind the wheel. he is somehow convinced that he''s the only
    person who understands the rules of the road, and it has become his mission in
    life to educate other drivers. his aggressive behavior includes slamming on his
    brakes -- even on the interstate -- when he thinks the car behind is tailgating.
    when he feels cars in the fast lane are going too slow, he cuts in on them and
    gives them the finger. anyone who doesn''t "step on it" at an intersection is
    in for a long blast on the horn to "wake them up." i''m afraid when our 15-year-old
    son gets his license, he''ll think he can drive the same way. i''ve tried to point
    out to him that this type of behavior could get us killed, but when he''s behind
    the wheel, he''s like a maniac. when alex gets home and calms down he always apologizes
    for getting carried away, but it''s the same story all over again the next time
    we''re in the car. abby, i can''t avoid riding with him because we have only one
    car. what can i do to convince alex how stupid and dangerous this really is? --

    bulkhead seating, but it goes fast. you usually have to take regular seating.
    on a trip to chicago this past spring, i was pinned in place, unable to move the
    entire flight. we changed planes in detroit, and i vowed to my companion that
    i wouldn''t suffer any more. when we boarded the next flight for the hop over
    lake michigan, a man took the seat in front of me, and proceeded to recline it.
    i braced my knees and he couldn''t move. he pushed and i pushed. he turned around
    and angrily said, "is there a suitcase behind my seat?" i just as angrily replied,
    "no, it''s my knees!" his jaw dropped. i was feeling a little guilty. thinking
    he was probably traveling all the way to l.a. on the continuation of the flight,
    i reasoned that he could recline after i disembarked from the 20-minute flight
    to chicago. when we landed, i stood to leave, and mr. recliner stood to disembark
    as well. he gave me a nasty look, and i said, "you got a problem, bud?" since
    i was a head taller than he was, he said, "no." i admit, i may have been rude,
    but how rude was he? i''m tired of being physically crushed by inconsiderate people.
    if that means i must be inconsiderate, too, so be it. nonsmokers have rights.

    although i have a close and cordial relationship with my in-laws, i felt more
    comfortable leaving the key with neighbors who are members of our local neighborhood

    later, at christmas, i discovered my mother-in-law had been in our house several
    times in our absence "looking for gift ideas." when they gave us a set of pots
    and pans, she admitted to having gone through the linen closet and our kitchen
    cupboards. i was shocked, and asked when she had done this. she then disclosed
    that they had made a duplicate of our hide-a-key and had stopped by on several
    occasions when our neighbor was at work, just to check our house, "which is so
    much better than leaving it to a stranger." my husband and i discussed it and
    decided not to ruin the holidays by confronting his mom and dad and asking them
    to return the key. we are now moving to a new house in a town farther away. i''m

    my beautiful and talented friend "sara," who arrived accompanied by her new beau,
    "sam," whom i had not yet met, but about whom i had heard quite a bit. i greeted
    them both warmly and invited them into my home. but what i really wanted to do
    was turn to my other guests and call out, "this is sam, the man who has been beating
    our friend sara." since the party, others have told me that had they realized
    who he was, they wouldn''t have shaken his hand, or they would have "told him
    a thing or two." the bottom line is that we were all polite, even cordial, toward
    him -- and that''s what is bothering me. i know enough about domestic violence
    to know that if you make the abuser uncomfortable, he will inevitably take it

    "flower fans" had a good idea in sending a "thinking of you" card a week after
    a funeral, and a flower arrangement a month later, but may i suggest that you
    don''t stop there? it''s comforting to know that others are going through those
    difficult "firsts" with you. how about a card in mid-november pledging thoughts
    and prayers for that first holiday season with an empty place at the festive table?
    if a parent was lost, a note before mother''s or father''s day can help them get
    past the store displays of cards they can no longer send. especially for the loss
    of a child, send a card just before the absent one''s birthday. the first anniversary
    of a loved one''s death should be commemorated. cards should carry a simple, encouraging
    tone. notes need not be elaborate. just say, "i''m thinking of you at this time,"
    share a happy memory of the departed that is associated with the occasion, or
    say something such as, "your daddy would have been so proud of you today." although
    flowers, lunch and service are an important way of showing you care, a card can
    be read in the middle of the night when sleep won''t come, or read again on a
    lonely morning. words on a page can be wrapped around you like a warm hug, reminders
    that you care. our modern times are often hectic, and it''s all too easy to forget
    another''s quiet grief in the hustle of our own lives, but i have found that by
    marking reminders all through the calendar, i can keep our friends'' needs in
    mind as the months go by. as the saying goes, "a joy shared is multiplied; grief
    shared is grief divided." -- susie in olympia, wash.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am 31 years old and have been healthy all my life -- or so i thought. i have
    annual physical examinations and pap smears. i trusted my doctor to let me know
    about any abnormal test results and thought that "no news is good news." well,
    i don''t think that way anymore. last april, i had a physical, and because i heard
    nothing from my doctor, i assumed everything was ok. however, in july, i had a
    minor problem and called for an appointment. my regular doctor couldn''t take
    me so i was seen by another doctor in the same group. the new doctor asked why
    i hadn''t returned for my "pinch biopsy." i was startled -- remember: no news
    is good news. my doctor had failed to notify me that my pap smear showed level-three
    dysplastic cells on my cervix. it seems that for three years, my pap smears had
    shown precancerous cells, but the test results had been simply filed in my chart
    and nothing was said to me about them! i was frightened and angry that this had
    slipped by my doctor. what is the annual exam for, if not to catch such things
    at an early stage? biopsies were done the next day and surgery was scheduled for
    two weeks later. part of my cervix was removed to eliminate the precancerous cells,
    but the new doctor warned me that the cells may appear again in the future. he
    said i would probably be able to get pregnant and carry a baby to term. abby,
    i wonder what would have happened to me had i not had that minor problem that
    caused me to see another doctor? would my regular doctor have caught the oversight
    at some point or would the reports have remained unnoticed in my file? his negligence
    could have cost me my life! i now have a new doctor. abby, please warn your readers
    not to buy into the adage that no news is good news and to call their doctors
    for test results. ignorance of the results could cost a life while knowledge of
    them could literally save one. -- lucky in connecticut'

    i have been the principal of an elementary school for four years, and for the
    most part have been able to keep my cool except during those noisy lunch hours
    in the cafeteria. every january, our school takes part in a "bound for literacy"
    promotion to encourage reading. the promotion is usually capped off by (who else?)
    the principal kissing a pig, eating worms or some other bit of nonsense to honor
    the students attaining a reading goal. this year, my husband and daughter -- a
    fifth-grader at the school -- suggested a stunt to literally "tie in" with the
    promotion''s name. i agreed to spend a lunch hour (two sessions) bound and gagged
    in a chair in the cafeteria if the student body read a total of 2,000 books. of
    course, i knew they would reach that goal, so i had to gear myself for the noise
    i''d have to contend with on the appointed day. it would be a deafening racket.
    friday, jan. 29, was the big day. just before lunch, several pta mothers armed
    with a bundle of jump ropes bound me securely, taped my mouth and hoisted me into
    a chair on a raised platform in the cafeteria. then the children filed in. of
    course, they giggled and waved -- but to my astonishment, the kids in both sessions
    were so quiet you could hear a spoon drop. i was amazed! one of the older children
    later told me, "we didn''t want to take advantage of you while you were all tied
    up." the following monday, the noise levels returned to normal in the cafeteria.
    i have no desire to spend lunch hours bound and gagged -- but i have acquired
    a new tolerance for lunchtime noise, and i have definitely gained added respect
    for my pupils. -- bound for literacy, abington, pa.'

    education." the writer then queried, "is this a jewish custom?" your response,
    "no, it''s not a jewish custom" could have easily been enclosed in an envelope
    and sent to the inquirer. to have exposed your millions of readers to a false

    he spends nothing on my children by my first marriage. i still pay all my own
    expenses, as i did when i was single -- my car payments, insurance, clothing,
    gas, and everything we purchase for the house, such as furniture, drapes, carpeting,
    linens. he also expects me to pay for his clothes and all of the groceries. i
    do this on a minimum-wage salary! he makes good money, owns his car free and clear,
    and the house is also paid for. all he pays for is utilities. he is rude and grouchy
    to my kids and has never bought them birthday or christmas presents. his mother
    lived with him before we were married, and he has bought her a brand-new car,
    paid her insurance, car payments and gas, and he lets her pick out her own presents
    for mother''s day, birthdays, etc. he will never change, and i''m not even sure
    i love him. am i a fool to stay with this man? -- no city, no state'

    may i please add my 2 cents to "repented in oregon," the young woman who had been
    promiscuous during high school and college? i was in the same situation, but unlike
    "repented," i didn''t wise up at 19. i was 24 when i began to turn my life around.
    by that time, i had slept with more than 50 men, had contracted herpes and flunked
    out of college -- since i spent more time in bars drinking and picking up men
    than studying. somewhere along the way, i had also managed to destroy my credit
    rating. my self-esteem and reputation were both in the dumpster. while in college,
    i had signed a contract with the army reserves and rotc. at the time, i didn''t
    expect to fulfill the contract since rotc would make me an officer and the contract
    was just a formality. without realizing it, i had made the best decision of my
    life. when i was suspended from college due to poor grades, i moved to another
    state. eventually, with the help of the military, i graduated from nursing school.
    i now have a wonderful career in the nursing profession, as well as a wonderful
    husband and two beautiful children. yes, my husband knows about my past and my
    herpes. we are careful so he has never contracted it. he loves me for who i am
    now, not who i was at one time. my friends and co-workers know i was a "wild child"
    but, like my husband, they see who i am now. unfortunately, when i visit my parents,
    who still live in my hometown, there are those who still see the "wild child."
    they continue to ignore the 11 years of accomplishments and growth that make me
    who i am today. i choose to see this as their loss, not mine. to "repented": the
    choices i have made throughout my recovery may not work for you, but know that
    your true friends will see you for who you are becoming, not who you were. good
    luck. -- been there and recovered in oklahoma'

    couldn''t name my child after our uncle because she''s trying to get pregnant

    i disagree with your advice to "lisa in california" that she should have her grandfather
    and father walk her down the aisle. her father gave up any rights or honors of
    being a father when he walked out on her when she was 2 years old. i have lived
    through a similar situation. when i got married, i certainly did not have my father
    give me away or even attend my wedding, for that matter. if her father is sincerely
    sorry for the way he has acted, he should understand her feelings and tell her
    that he completely understands and agrees that her grandfather deserves the honor.
    after all, the grandfather was the one who was part of her life when the father
    chose to walk away. i also disagree with your suggestion that she could walk alone.
    why should she? i have never regretted my decision and i''ve been married 15 years.
    even after my father''s death three years ago, i had no regrets. in this situation
    and my own, the fathers were the adults and made their own adult decisions. now

    i''d like to thank you for the help you''ve provided to caregivers throughout
    the years. regarding "still in shock in illinois," there are some other precautions
    families can take to ensure the proper care of their loved ones with regard to
    hiring home-care aides: if possible, your loved one should receive care through
    a licensed home health-care agency or registry. find out what kind of insurance
    they carry. find out what procedures they use for background checks. check all
    references yourself. is someone available to assist you and your loved ones after-hours
    or in an emergency? assess what level of care your loved one requires. does the
    aide have the skills necessary for the job? do not let an aide have access to
    checking accounts. if money is needed for expenses, give them only what is necessary
    and always get receipts. and as "still in shock" rightfully recommended in her
    letter, vary the times of your visits and ask other relatives and friends to stop
    by as often as possible. above all: trust your own instincts! if you feel that
    something is not right -- it probably isn''t. -- gary barg, publisher, today''s

    may i comment on the letter from the woman who purchased an answering machine
    to monitor calls while her husband was terminally ill? it lifted the burden of
    responding immediately to callers, and the messages people left were a source
    of comfort and support to her husband. several years ago, my husband was in the
    hospital. in order to keep friends and family updated on his condition, i put
    a message on my answering machine. that way, they did not wonder how he was, and
    it saved me many repetitive phone calls. everyone appreciated the message, which
    i updated frequently, and they did not hesitate to call because they knew they
    were not bothering me. -- maria bremer, mc henry, ill.'

    i have a pet peeve: people who call me on the phone and expect me to recognize
    their voices. this is especially irritating when it involves business calls. one
    of our company''s clients never identifies himself. he has a pleasant voice but
    it has no unique quality, and every time he calls i have to ask who is calling.
    it''s embarrassing for me and i worry that it insults him. i don''t want to lose
    a client, and i certainly don''t want to tell him that his voice is so ordinary
    i simply cannot recognize it. isn''t it a matter of courtesy when you call someone

    i found your response to the twins whose divorced father would not continue child
    support payments or pay for higher education to be factually accurate, but a bit
    narrow in its vision. my wife left her home state 10 years ago for a much better
    job. after a child custody battle that almost bankrupted her, she was forced to
    leave her 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter with her ex-husband. despite
    a court order, her son refused to fly up to see her after the first few visits
    and was rarely available when she flew there. football, basketball, friends --
    all held more importance than his mother. despite her never missing a holiday
    gift, i can count on one hand the number of phone calls or thank-yous she has
    received. care to guess how many times they forgot her birthday? when it came
    time for him to choose a college, my wife offered to assist with tuition if he
    considered an ivy league school or the school from which she and her former husband
    graduated. she was chastised for trying to "force" him to attend a college he
    did not wish to. perhaps the twins should examine how they treated their father
    while the child support was paid consistently every month. sounds like dad held
    up his end. maybe they should examine whether theirs was held up equally well.
    by the way, do you remember that classic letter you answered many years ago with,
    "how old will you be in four years if you don''t?" thanks to that answer, my wife
    graduated from medical school three years ago at the age of 42, and she hasn''t
    regretted any of her decisions since she decided to get divorced. she''s one smart
    lady, and i''m immensely proud of her. -- been there, done that'

    i fully agree with your response to the young man who felt his father should continue
    to pay child support while he and his twin brother were in college. if this "adult"
    was so concerned about his mother having to work two jobs so he could go to college,
    he should take responsibility for his own education. your suggestion to take fewer
    hours of classes and get a part-time job was excellent. may i offer another route?

    benefits and went to night school. through different programs, i was able to get

    maybe my experience will keep other hearts from being broken as mine was. i was

    even claim it''s nonexistent, but their wives seem to get pregnant anyway. immaculate

    our engagement, the planning of our wedding and honeymoon until now, she has tried
    to control our lives. she and her mother even planned a trip to coincide with
    our honeymoon so we could "all be together"! abby, he is 63 and i''m 43. i don''t
    need her or anyone else planning our lives. my husband is very passive. he refuses
    to say anything to them in spite of my complaints. he has been friends with her
    parents for 40 years, and he acts as if he''s so committed and loyal to them that
    he cannot tell them to stay out of our lives. my husband even allowed the daughter
    to plan an easter dinner at our home without my knowledge. she invited all of
    her friends and family. she tried to plan thanksgiving dinner at our place, too,
    until i put my foot down. that made her angry. now she leaves messages on the
    answering machine telling my husband to call her. i have tried explaining to her
    in a civil manner how i resent her interference. there have been other incidents,
    and i''m only touching the treetops here. but she has been running my husband''s
    life for so long, my unhappiness falls on deaf ears. i''m at my wit''s end. i
    love my husband, but i can''t remain married to a man who''s more loyal to his
    friends than to his wife. what do you think i should do? -- georgia in georgia'

    in december of last year, i was traveling to college to take my final exams when
    i was in a serious automobile accident. it had been snowing most of the morning
    and i lost control of my car. i hit the guardrail, a large truck, a tree -- and
    ended up in a ditch. when my car stopped spiraling out of control, i got out,
    and as i stood in the snow, i screamed but no sounds came out. i was crying, but
    no tears rolled down my cheeks. my body was in shock. the first person to stop
    at the accident was molly. she came to me, put her arms around me and held me.
    when she did that, i collapsed. i was so scared and so alone. she took me to her
    car where it was warm and safe. she calmed me by telling me about her young children
    and her christmas tree. she was like a guardian angel. we sat in her car until
    the state police arrived. after the police and rescue arrived, everything happened
    so fast i never got the chance to give molly a hug and properly thank her. abby,

    please help us to make a decision. our 81-year-old father likes women -- females

    have moved to another state, away from us. they are now living next door to a
    wonderful young couple who have a 3-year-old girl. so far, dad just watches the
    child when they visit and he only gives the young mother elaborate hugs and makes
    risque remarks. mom admits that "she watches him like a hawk" when she baby-sits
    the little girl. abby, we are worried the day will come when he is alone with
    the child or the parents make the mistake of asking him to baby-sit. do we warn

    the letter about the "ugly" secretary and your reply reminded me of a story my
    secretary, "alice," told me years ago about her son who was in the second grade.
    sonny kept coming home telling his parents how beautiful his new teacher was.
    alice and her husband looked forward to meeting this beautiful teacher. the night
    of the pta open house finally arrived. when they met sonny''s teacher, they were
    shocked to see she was a plain, somewhat elderly, woman. after they returned home,
    they asked their son how he could call his teacher beautiful. he replied, "because
    she smiles so pretty." abby, may i share another anecdote with you -- this time,
    my own? i was a part-time food server for many years. i was thrust into my first
    server''s position from a busboy''s job when one of the servers called in sick.
    i was unprepared for that job and uneasy, but what could i do but follow the boss''s
    orders? on my second night, i had to serve a party of eight. i was terrified i''d
    make a mistake, but i made it through. when the gentleman paid the bill, he told
    me, "you are a good server." i guess he could see my relief and surprise as i
    stammered a thank-you. he added, "do you know why i said that? you smile a lot."
    i have always remembered that. -- alfred j. wilson, southlake, texas'

    the letter from "mourning in texas" prompted me to write. "mourning" was disappointed
    about the small number of floral arrangements sent to his late wife''s funeral.
    you were correct in stating that many people donate money to charity in order
    that "something good" may come from the sadness of a loved one''s death. however,
    we should all remember that floral arrangements sent to a wake or the home of
    the grieving are also "something good" -- and useful. too often, people hesitate
    to send flowers thinking they''ll be thrown out after the funeral. but what is
    important is the message of condolence that flowers convey to the grieving family
    during those extremely difficult few days. flowers are for the living -- they
    say, "we loved her, too. she had value to us, and we care that you are grieving."
    this is not to say that making a charitable donation isn''t worthwhile, but to
    remind people that sometimes flowers speak volumes. may i share with you what
    my husband and i do at such times? when we attend a funeral or a wake, we take
    a card and a single rose. one week later, we send a "thinking of you" card. a
    month later, we send a colorful arrangement of flowers to the family of the deceased
    to let them know they are still in our thoughts and prayers. i cannot tell you
    how often we are told, "thank you for thinking of us. it feels as though everyone''s
    world has gone on and no one remembers we are in pain, but you remember." abby,
    it makes us feel wonderful to let someone know they matter. -- flower fans, long

    as well for having initially denied it was me! abby, thinking up enough good lies

    may i make a suggestion to "driven crazy," whose husband is afraid to drive? i
    taught both my children, and one foreign friend who was also frightened at the
    prospect, to drive with confidence in crazy california using a simple technique:
    wake up before dawn and practice where there are no other cars on the road. when
    a novice driver isn''t worried about what other vehicles might do, he or she can
    concentrate on skills like getting on and off the freeway, parking in tight spots,
    making u-turns, changing lanes and so forth. start on the weekends, when traffic
    is low, and let the driver set the pace. as he or she gains confidence, drive
    later in the day as traffic increases. in a few months, your driver will be ready
    to take on any traffic jam, which is actually the easiest driving yet: the cars
    just sit there. -- out of a jam in tustin, calif.'

    we live next door to a military man and his wife. we like them both very much,
    and help each other with little things. his wife is older than he and has health
    problems. my husband and i know positively that he''s having an affair with a
    married woman he met several months ago when he was going through some additional
    training. knowing about his affair makes it difficult to be in their company.
    we certainly do not condone his behavior. we are very uncomfortable when certain
    things are said. we feel caught in the middle because we learned about his affair
    accidentally. we would never butt into their business, but they are both friendly
    with us. we purposely avoid them at times. we know the affair is continuing, and
    that he''s thinking of leaving his wife, but he doesn''t want to be ruined financially.
    if we suddenly distance ourselves from them, they''ll wonder why. we feel trapped
    in our home because they always talk to us when we are in the yard. have you any

    eight years ago, i came out of the closet. i had been married for 18 years and
    had two children -- a son, 15, and a daughter, 17. at the time, i decided that
    for 40 years i had lived my life for everyone else, and it was time to live my
    life for myself. i have had a lover for seven years. we have a loving and compassionate
    relationship. at the time i "came out," my family disowned me, and we have not
    talked since. my son, on the other hand, kept in touch. he and his fiancee have
    visited my lover and me several times, and we have enjoyed a good relationship
    over the years. during that time, my lover and i have been very generous to my
    son with birthday and christmas gifts, and even bought him a new car. when he
    and his fiancee visited us on several occasions, we all got along well. they met
    our gay friends and socialized with us. last week, my son called to say they were
    sending out wedding invitations. i am welcome, but my lover is not. i explained
    to him that we are just as much a couple as my brother and his wife, or my sister
    and her husband. he told me that he did not want his friends to know he had a
    gay father, and therefore, my lover would not be allowed to attend. i told him
    that if my lover could not attend, then i would not attend. if he cannot accept
    us openly, and if he''s ashamed of our relationship, then i really do not want
    any further contact with him. we are very hurt. for the last eight years he appeared
    to accept our relationship, especially when it came to gifts and several free
    trips for him and his fiancee to visit us. abby, am i wrong? i''ll be interested

    in an age where infidelity and sexual violence rule the headlines, it angers me
    that this mother feels that "''arnie,'' a fine young man who loves my daughter,"
    who admirably attends college part-time while working, is not making the grade.
    so mom is concerned that her daughter might have to forgo the new cars and nice
    vacations she has grown up with, and live with a more average income? please!
    yet the letter is signed "a loving mom." how about "a materialistic mom"? if daughter
    was as concerned as mother about living on easy street, my guess is that she would
    have dumped arnie long ago. i vehemently disagree with your advice to the mother

    for two reasons: first of all, things between us are great everywhere except in
    bed. i''m not the most sensitive guy, but her lack of enthusiasm in this department
    is obvious. second, one day last week i was supposed to meet her at her office
    for lunch. when i arrived, there was a note for me to wait in her office until
    she returned from a meeting. being curious about her various projects, i looked
    through her files. i came across a file with the gay woman''s name on it. i couldn''t
    resist. i read through it and was shocked. in the file was a collection of beautiful
    love letters and poems written by this woman to my wife. some of the poems were
    very erotic. abby, i can''t stop thinking about the possibility that my wife was
    -- or still is -- lovers with this woman. it''s torturing me. should i confront

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my fiance, "bob," and i have a problem. it seems like every few days we receive
    an invitation to a birthday party for someone in his large extended family. just
    yesterday, we received an invitation to a joint celebration for both his aunt''s
    birthday (she will be 41) and his cousin, who will be 22. the problem is, none
    of these people ever send bob a birthday card. he does receive cards from his
    immediate family, one of his two grandmothers and my family, but nothing from
    any of his extended family. abby, it hurts him when they forget his birthday,
    especially when we receive an invitation to yet another family birthday. i don''t
    feel comfortable saying anything to them on his behalf. is there anything we can
    do? -- feeling frustrated'

    i am a 30-year-old male. three years ago i met a wonderful woman two years my
    junior. we dated, fell in love and became engaged. during the last year, we''ve
    been arguing about personality differences (disrespectful behavior, selfishness,
    insecurities -- the usual stuff). we love each other very much; however, we have
    both behaved inappropriately when we were angry. she broke off the engagement.
    i desperately want to work this out, but she''s acting very cold and says she''s
    not sure she wants to marry me. i''ve told her i''m sorry, that the issues we
    fought about are trivial and we can work them out, but she is hurt and afraid.
    abby, what do i do now? -- stricken in connecticut'

    when you have made the suggestion in past columns to offer making a visitor''s
    reservation at a nearby motel -- who is supposed to pay for it? is it assumed
    that the visitor will pay for his own accommodations, or is it assumed that with
    the offer of making the reservation comes the obligation to pay for it? thank
    you for your answer on this one. -- just wondering'
