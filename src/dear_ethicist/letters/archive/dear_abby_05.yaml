    recently, at a family get-together at my home, a photo album was passed around
    for family members to enjoy. this album contained many pictures from as far back
    as the early ''40s. one "in-law" was seen looking at two particular pictures for
    a very long time. the pictures were of her husband and his first wife. (their
    marriage ended in divorce.) after everyone left, i noticed that those two pictures
    had been removed from the album! this in-law and her husband do not live in the
    same town with us. i am sure wife no. 2 removed those pictures from the album.
    (they are probably shredded by now.) what do you think of this? and how would
    you handle this the next time we have a family get-together, which is only once
    a year? steamed in georgia'

    i have a problem that may seem trivial to some, bu it has become a source of irritation
    to all concerned. my husband''s brother and his family come to our home quite
    frequently, and i always love to see them, but before i let them in, i ask them
    (especially their children) to please check their shoes, and if they''re dirty,
    to please remove them, as we have light-colored carpets throughout our house.
    we have lots of animals and muddy areas around our house. this family always put
    their feet up on my furniture with their shoes on. i don''t mind if they put their
    feet up, as i do it myself, but i ask that they remove their shoes before doing
    so. although they have never been refused admission, it is quite obvious by the
    irritated expressions on their faces that they think i am being too picky. i feel
    that by now they should know that i don''t want my carpets soiled and i shouldn''t
    have to remind them every time they come over. tell me, am i rude to ask them
    to check their shoes? or are they rude to act irritated and imposed upon when
    i ask them? don''t tread on me'

    this is my first time to write. i, too, am one of those "pop in" preachers. i
    always try to make it at a convenient time. i thought perhaps you would like to
    share the following with your readers: our minister never stops "occasionally
    someone will say, ''our minister never stops by to visit us.'' "if your minister
    never stops at your home, you should probably thank god. it means death has not
    struck, that no serious illness has laid you low, that the surgeon''s knife has
    not been necessary, that you have no serious family problem, or that you are not
    a spiritually delinquent member. "as a rule, your minister does not have time
    for a ''social call.'' not that he wouldn''t enjoy it; it''s just a matter of
    priorities-putting first things first. "however, you may be sure of this: your
    minister is willing to come to the hospital or your home, the jail, the street
    corner, or anywhere at any hour of the night or day-wherever or whenever he is
    needed. so, call him if you need him. otherwise, he will not know of your need
    until it is too late. "for the moment, thank god you have not needed your minister.
    one day you may need him, and he will heed your call." preacher in north little

    will need it for a nursing home, as there is not one among us who can stand to

    i sponsored him for a "green card" so he could work in the usa. (i''m a u.s. citizen.)

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'dear readers: next week is fire prevention week, and despite declines, the
    united states and canada still have the highest fire death rates of all the developed
    countries of the free world. the most recent figures (for 1986): in the united
    states, 5,850 civilians and 113 firefighters died in fires, and approximately
    26,825 civilians and 100,900 firefighters were seriously injured. the total loss
    in property alone came to $6.7 billion. each season has its own special fire hazards.
    here are some tips for all seasons: fall: if you enjoy camping, select a tent
    made of flame-resistant fabric. pack a reliable flashlight with plenty of extra
    batteries to light the inside of your tent-never use matches or candles. when
    building a campfire, place it downwind of your tent. and never try to hasten the
    burning by using gasoline or other flammable liquid starters. if you use your
    fireplace, have your chimney professionally cleaned in the fall to make sure it''s
    in good condition for the coming season. winter: more fires occur during the winter
    than in any other season. the reasons: home heating and the holiday season. if
    you use a portable heater, be sure it is placed away from combustibles-draperies,
    furniture, paper, etc. remember, the surface heat of some portable heaters may
    reach 500 degrees, so keep a careful watch on your children and warn them to keep
    away from heaters. hospitals are treating an increasing number of patients with
    burns resulting from contact with the outside surface of some portable heaters.
    for a merry christmas, choose a christmas tree that does not have shedding needles,
    and keep it standing in water while it is in the house. if you choose an artificial
    tree, choose one that is flame-resistant. after holiday parties, before retiring,
    check your ashtrays for smoldering cigarette butts, and carefully examine all
    upholstered chairs and sofas to make sure that no "live" cigarette butts have
    fallen between the cushions. remember, most house fires occur between 8 p.m. and
    8 a.m., when people are sleeping. spring: take spring cleaning seriously-clean
    out your attic, basement, garage and workshop. throw out trash, especially combustibles
    such as rags, newspapers, magazines, boxes and scraps of wood. never smoke while
    fueling gas-powered lawn mowers or chain saws. if you must store gasoline, store
    it in a ventilated area in a can designed especially for that purpose. and store
    oily rags and paint in a cool place in tightly sealed metal containers. summer:
    when cooking out, never use flammable liquids near live coals. an explosion or
    flash fire could result. when you''ve finished cooking, soak the coals with water
    and make absolutely sure they''re out when you leave. smoldering coals that appear
    to be "dead" can reignite as much as a day later. if you use a propane gas grill,
    always have the lighted match in position before turning on the gas. "play it
    safe . . . plan your escape!" is this year''s theme. some tips for all seasons:
    -never smoke in bed. -never leave invalids or small children alone in the house,
    not even for "a few minutes." -never use flammable liquids for dry cleaning indoors.
    -have periodic fire drills in your home to be sure everyone knows what to do in
    case of fire. -keep easy-to-use fire extinguishers in your kitchen, cottage, back
    bedrooms and on your boat. invest in smoke detectors, and be sure that they are
    kept dust-free and in working order. -the telephone number of your fire department
    should be taped to every telephone in your house. if it isn''t, should a fire
    occur, don''t waste time trying to find it; get out, and call from a neighbor''s
    house. and once you are out, stay out. no treasure is worth risking your life
    for. it took less than three minutes to read this column. was it worth it? i hope
    so.-abby'

    my doctor just told me that i have systemic lupus erythematosus. what do you know
    about this disease? i am a 29-year-old school teacher, divorced, and have a 5-year-old
    daughter who stays with my mother most of the time. i feel so tired i can hardly
    keep up with my job. my problem developed shortly after my daughter was born.
    i developed a kidney infection and was never able to get my strength back. i am
    taking some medicine that makes me retain fluid and have gained a lot of weight.
    my face looks like a pumpkin, and the dizziness, diarrhea, headaches and the swelling
    of my hands and knees have driven me close to the edge. my doctor says that lupus
    is a rare, mysterious disease with no cure in sight. what i need most is someone
    to talk to. can you help me? lady with lupus'

    i do volunteer work with an alumni association at a large state university. we
    have a difficult time trying to locate our alums who move or change their names

    and also helped her plan her wedding. when i received my invitation, i learned
    that i was expected to come without my fiance. i thought it was an oversight because
    violet knows i have a fiance, so i mentioned it. she said she was sorry but nobody
    could invite an escort because she couldn''t afford to have extra people. it''s
    to be a catered affair. i tried to explain that i really wanted my fiance to be
    there. i even offered to pay for his dinner in advance. she said no. i told her
    if she couldn''t let my fiance come, i couldn''t be in her wedding party. well,

    the other day i delivered a speech, which was well-received by the audience. first,
    let me say that i worked very hard for several weeks to prepare this speech. i
    was introduced in the following way: "we had hoped to have mr. jones as our speaker
    today, but he had a previous engagement in another city. he recommended mr. smith,
    but, unfortunately, mr. smith was not available at this time so he graciously
    agreed to send his assistant, mr. johnson. please join me in welcoming mr. johnson."
    although i had heard others introduced in this way, the impact of such an introduction
    never struck home until i was on the receiving end! as i have said, my speech
    was well-prepared and i worked hard on its presentation. furthermore, i happen
    to be even better acquainted with the subject matter than either mr. smith or
    mr. jones-a fact they both would readily have acknowledged. it seems to me that
    such an introduction was not only insulting to the speaker, it prepared the audience
    for a rather disappointing presentation. am i being overly sensitive? hurt in

    i can''t stand to look at them. along with this, my skin stretched during my pregnancy.
    i can''t wear shorts, and a bathing suit is out of the question. is there a doctor

    that i am not just being vain. i really look pathetic. please help me. i''m desperate!

    "i don''t have a vocabulary to tell the pleasure of sleeping alone after sharing
    a bed with the same man for 30 years. it was heaven. it took months to get used
    to the sheer joyous ecstasy." poor men. every sexist, stupid, selfish, chauvinistic,
    domineering, leering, lusting, mean, ugly, arrogant, date-raping, down-putting,
    undercutting thing men do to women is reported, surveyed, dissected and tabulated
    in that new book being promoted to best-seller status, shere hite''s "women and
    love." "women and why they hate men" would be a more accurate title for the 922-page
    collection of quotes and analysis. "one thing that has always amazed me is that
    a man can ignore you or treat you shabbily and then expect you to respond to him
    with love when he wants sex." the third in hite''s trilogy about changing relationships
    between men and women, the hefty book is based on essay-type answers to a lengthy
    questionnaire filled out anonymously by 4,500 women recruited through a variety
    of women''s groups and by self- selection. the methodology provides enough poignant
    personal stories and complaints about men to fill a decade of daily ann landers
    and dear abby columns. it is being attacked by critics as unscientific and defended
    by the author and her supporters as essential to elicit honest feelings. "i remember
    crying over problems with my husband. why? because i could never reach him. i
    could never really communicate with him, never share with him . . . the divorce
    was like death and rebirth." but readers are left with the choice of concluding
    that (1) the survey sample is biased; (2) the author''s selection of responses
    and analyses is prejudiced; or (3) overwhelming numbers of women really feel mistreated
    and used by men. hite says, for example, that 84 percent of women are not satisfied
    emotionally with their relationships with men; 96 percent give men more emotional
    support than they get; 95 percent report emotional and psychological harassment
    from men they love; 95 percent say men assume they should come first psychologically
    in relationships; 93 percent work harder at making relationships work than do
    men. the litany of complaints about men goes on and on and on. men distance themselves
    emotionally and won''t talk about problems and feelings. men nag. they use physical
    violence against women. they expect women to make a relationship work. or they
    don''t want a relationship-just sex. men smother women and usurp their identity.
    eighty-five percent of the single women report that most men expect sex on the
    first date. if a woman refuses, she may be accused to playing games or being stuffy
    and risks never seeing the guy again. if she does have sex, he may consider her
    "easy" and not return. eighty percent say they have had the experience of having
    sex with a man and then never hearing from him again. "pressure to have sex has
    been a big problem for women since the phony ''sexual liberation'' of the ''60s,
    which made us ''free'' to do whatever a man wanted us to do. they all had the
    gall to assume that now that the moral constraints didn''t forbid our having sex,
    of course we wanted to do it with them, whenever they asked for it." it''s surprising
    that such a voluminous book about women, men and love would devote only seven
    pages to the effects of children on love between men and women-only three of the
    pages positive and happy. but it spends more than 100 pages on gay women and gay
    relationships. hite''s own prejudices are clear from the short sections of analysis
    that link the extensive quotes. she often slips into vintage antimale feminist
    rhetoric. she says women risk marriage and endure its injustices "because the
    idea of marriage" still holds hope of intimacy and trust, but notes that about
    half of wives break up their disappointing marriages and many who stay do so in
    bitterness and disillusionment. "would it be too simplistic to blame all our problems
    on the ''male ideology'' with its hierarchical and aggressive motifs?" hite asks.
    she rejects the idea that biology is the root of sex inequality and notes that
    patriarchy is, after all, "the system underlying all other systems" in society
    and history. never mind that millions of women love and live with men in lasting
    intimacy, with a reasonable degree of equality and happiness. maybe they didn''t
    bother to fill out hite''s exhaustive questionnaire or their answers didn''t fit
    hite''s theories. "we no longer believe in the male gods; their power over us
    has ended." poor men. it isn''t easy to adjust to a cultural revolution when it''s
    aimed at you.'

    my wife, kathy, and i are both jewish, so when she became pregnant in 1985, i
    took a simple blood test to determine if i was a carrier of tay-sachs-a hideous
    disease that predominantly strikes jewish children. about one out of 30 jewish
    adults is a tay- sachs carrier. if a carrier marries another carrier, there is
    a one out of four chance that their baby will develop tay-sachs. i was tested
    at a local hospital and was told i was not a carrier, so since both parents must
    be carriers in order to produce a tay-sachs child, there was no reason for kathy
    to be tested. in june 1986, kathy had a beautiful baby. we named her abigail.
    she appeared to be a normal, happy baby, but when she didn''t sit up or progress
    the way other babies her age did, we became concerned and consulted a specialist.
    his diagnosis: tay-sachs. we were devastated! abby, our daughter will never crawl,
    walk or speak. instead, she will go blind, become paralyzed, have seizures and
    die before she is 3, 4 or 5 years old. how could this have happened when i was
    told i was not a carrier? our specialist called the hospital and discovered that
    the lab technician had made a simple mathematical error! we later learned that
    the hospital''s policy was to only "spot-check" their results. meanwhile, we looked
    into suing the lab, but were advised by several prominent malpractice attorneys
    that in new york it is not possible to collect damages for "pain and suffering."
    we finally found a lawyer who agreed to take our case, but were told not to expect
    too much. abby, no amount of money can compensate for having to watch one''s child
    slowly die, but we want to warn other prospective parents so this won''t happen
    to them. no one should have to go through the hell we are presently going through.

    i''d like to get this off my chest. it''s about time humans stopped referring
    to acts that people perpetrate as people "acting like animals." i refer generally
    to those who describe murders, riots, panics and other catastrophes in which people
    lose control and are said to be "acting like animals." i refer specifically to
    comments regarding a recent ship hijacking when it was said that the terrorists
    acted like "cowardly animals." these terrorists and guerrilla acts are not animal
    in nature. they are human in nature. as one who sees the balance, beauty and meaning
    of the world in which animals must face life-or-death situations every day just
    to survive and perpetuate the species, i grossly resent and take offense at these
    statements. when was the last time we saw a gorilla hijack a plane? when was the
    last time we saw a pod of whales hijack an ocean liner? when was the last time
    we saw a group of animals walk down the street and terrorize the neighborhood?
    people, in fact, are the terrorists and guerrillas when they go into the animals''
    element to slaughter them for fur coats, hunting trophies, plumage and all the
    other atrocious reasons society gives for the gross neglect of respect for life
    and murder of our fellow creatures inhabiting this world. if the day ever comes
    when man comes off his ego trip, maybe he will see just how insignificant he is
    to the total scheme of things on this tremendous planet in which all creatures
    share. maybe then, finally, the saying will be turned around to, "they behaved

    i am the woman whose letter you published about whistling. (our next-door neighbor
    whistled constantly, which we found intolerable.) well, since my letter appeared
    in the portland oregonian, i received 23 telephone calls from all over the united
    states and one from canada, plus letters and postcards. truly overwhelming! everyone
    wanted to talk about his or her experiences with "whistlers." most were on the
    funny side, but two calls were sad. a 16-year-old california girl said her father
    works nights, so he''s at home during the daytime. she invited some friends over
    to listen to records. her father whistled constantly, so she asked him to please
    stop. he hit her in the mouth, knocking out two teeth, then threw her out the
    door, saying he would have no "mouthy brat" living in his home! a woman from georgia
    said that her gentle, lovable father moved in with her family two months ago.
    he loves the children and they loved him when he didn''t live with them and they
    only visited him. he whistles all the time-even at the dinner table. her husband
    threatens to move out, and the five children fight all the time and refuse to
    be around grandpa. her headache never stops. now they are going to put grandpa
    in a nursing home "where he will surely die soon"! wouldn''t it have been wonderful
    if someone, many years ago, helped these whistlers to stop a seemingly harmless
    habit? in my letter, i treated it as a joke. i don''t find it funny anymore. thanks

    when my children were small, i taught them to ask for whatever they wanted from
    the refrigerator. then as they became teenagers, all at once this problem came
    up. i go to prepare a meal and find that all the leftovers i had planned to use
    for the meal are gone! so i ask, "who ate the leftover roast beef i had wrapped
    up?" no one knows anything. then i say, "if you get hungry, make a peanut butter
    and jelly sandwich, or take a piece of fruit-just don''t eat the leftovers unless
    i say, ''hey, anybody can eat this; there isn''t enough left over to do anything
    with."'' sometimes i don''t care if they eat all the leftovers-but there are times
    when i do care. i just wish they''d ask me, that''s all. we aren''t poor, but
    my budget would stretch a lot further if the kids wouldn''t eat everything in
    sight. do other mothers have this problem, and what do they do about it? it''s
    hard to hide things that need to be refrigerated, and i can''t put a lock on the
    fridge. does anyone have any ideas? ma in melrose, fla.'

    last week i hosted a party at my home to which some 75 co- workers had been personally

    "adults" get at college. when i visited our daughter''s campus last fall, i was
    shocked to discover that the dorms and students'' townhouses reminded me of the

    children, it''s not fair to subject them to this kind of temptation. i wonder
    how many parents feel as uneasy as i do. or have our moral standards sunk so low
    that parents are no longer concerned with the morals of their children? this may

    you said it is possible for a woman to become pregnant and still remain a virgin.
    it sounds impossible, but i know it''s true, which reminds me of a similar story
    i read in a reputable magazine some years ago. it seems that during the civil
    war (may 12, 1863, to be exact), a young virginia farm girl was standing on her
    front porch when a stray bullet first passed through the scrotum of a young union
    cavalryman, then lodged in the reproductive tract of the young woman, who thus
    became pregnant by a man she had not been within 100 feet of! and nine months
    later she gave birth to a healthy baby. you don''t believe it? if it hadn''t been
    published in the very reliable american heritage magazine (december 1971, page
    99, in a story titled, "the case of the miraculous bullet"), i wouldn''t have
    believed it either. leland e. smith, nashville, tenn.'

    have spent years trying to outdo each other. in the end, the book proves that
    sisterhood may indeed be powerful, but it can also be plenty catty. "i understand
    why eppie''s disturbed," they quote popo as saying. "she wanted to be the first
    violin in the school orchestra, but i was. she swore she''d marry a millionaire,
    but i did." neither lederer nor phillips cooperated with the writing of this unauthorized
    biography (in fact, the authors note the many roadblocks the sisters threw in
    their path), but more than 150 of their friends, relatives and associates did.
    the result is an incredibly juicy story of lives entwined so closely that, over
    time, their sisterly bond appeared to degenerate into one of backbiting and intrigue.
    born and raised in sioux city, ia., the sisters grew up as the incredibly close
    friedman twins. they dressed alike, they talked alike, they slept in the same
    single bed, even their names-esther pauline and pauline esther-were identical.
    the first night they spent away from each other was after their double wedding.
    then the trouble started. popo had married into money, something she never failed
    to point out to everyone, and eppie hadn''t. in fact, after several years, the
    sisters found themselves in the same town, eau claire, wis., with eppie''s husband
    working for popo''s. the tension between the twins began to spill into a contest
    for attention. for example, there was the time eppie spoke before a red cross
    meeting. upon hearing how successful her sister''s speech was, popo called the
    secretary of family service and asked to be a featured speaker. then she bought
    up all the tickets and gave them to her friends. evidently, the twins'' ever-escalating
    bid for publicity began to rile the publisher of the local paper. "i told them
    they would be put on a ration," says marshall atkinson of the eau claire leader-telegram.
    "only one picture in the newspaper every six months. they were very indignant.
    . . ." competition turned into outright feuding in 1955, when both sisters started
    writing advice columns. according to pottker and speziale, eppie was furious that
    popo became dear abby only three months after she became ann landers. "after years
    of being overshadowed by her sister, eppie believed she had achieved something
    unique and apart from her twin," they write. "she was not prepared for rival syndication
    from anyone, and especially not popo." from that point on, the hostility between
    the sisters escalated, and pottker and speziale, both washington journalists,
    have documented every detail. for example: - the life magazine article where popo
    mentioned eppie''s nose job, adding that eppie "revealed certain freudian flaws
    of character by going through with the operation." - eppie''s retaliation that
    popo is "just like a kid who beats a dog until somebody looks, and then she starts
    petting it." - the eight years when the twins refused to speak to each other,
    even at the wedding of eppie''s daughter, margo. sen. hubert humphrey tried to
    patch things up by dancing with both sisters at once. it didn''t work. - the assessment
    of william steven, their minneapolis editor, on working with both ann and abby,
    "one does not cross those babes." still, there is more to the ann-abby story than
    feuding twins with identical jobs: how did two ''50s-era women propel themselves
    into high-rolling careers while upholding the sanctity of traditional family roles
    in print? while pottker and speziale examine that fascinating trajectory through
    the personalities of ann and abby, author david grossvogel takes a different approach.
    in "dear ann landers," grossvogel, a professor of literature and romance languages
    at cornell, analyzes what he calls "the intimate and changing dialogue" readers
    have had with landers since 1955. to that end, grossvogel has read more than 35,000
    letters-every one landers ever published, he claims-and divided them into related
    categories. the result is a sociological compendium of our concerns and values
    over the last 30-plus years. that makes it, at times, a fun book to dip into,
    especially when grossvogel records the details of the raging toilet paper debate.
    (should the paper come over the top of the roll or under? approximately 15,000
    readers had an opinion.) also, there''s the national uproar that occurred when
    landers said that housewives should iron their sheets and towels. but, all too
    often, grossvogel''s insights are too predictable; most people could guess that
    sex, drugs and women''s rights are bigger issues today than in the 1950s. still,
    the book functions nicely as a collection of ann landers'' "golden oldies." and
    there''s an interesting interview with landers herself, who says that she has
    "a visceral feeling about the topics i should take to my readers. . .when i ran
    across the toilet paper letter, i knew at once it was a subject thousands of people
    would want to say something about." that visceral feeling is, of course, what
    keeps all of ann''s and abby''s readers-an estimated 90 million daily-tuning in
    for more. reading their columns is like eavesdropping on a national party line
    and that, of course, is what both books are all about. caption: photo: popo phillips

    for $50 with a note saying it was for towels. a few days later i received a set
    of towels that did not match my bathroom, but i remembered seeing them hanging

    i am a senior faculty member at a small liberal arts college in virginia. annually,
    our administration has a beginning-of-the-ye ar reception for faculty and staff.
    generally, this is a pretty dull affair, somewhat stilted and formal. this year,
    the invitation stated "open house from 6:30 until 8:30." by 8 o''clock, the occasion
    became festive and quite pleasant. however, promptly at 8:30, all the food and
    drink were suddenly removed from every table and the lights were blinked off and
    on to signal the end of the affair! this, in my view, gave the guests the impression
    that they were simply "hired hands" being tolerated for two hours, not professionally
    respected colleagues. is my perception inaccurate? or was such behavior simply
    "low rent," as we say in the south? virginia lady'

    four times a year, in either joan muffler''s living room in philadelphia or judy
    young''s kitchen in moorestown, n.j., the two women get together to type up and
    lay out a newsletter called the beirut connection. it is national in scope and
    is eagerly awaited in cities like chicago and los angeles. in small towns like
    wickenburg, ariz., and gilbertsville, ky. and out in the rural stretches of america-from
    the western woods in washington state to the eastern woods of maine. but it is
    a select few who subscribe, for most of the circulation is made up of families
    whose sons and husbands were veterans who served in beirut from 1982 to 1984 with
    the u.s. marine corps; 268 of those men did not come home alive. muffler''s 19-year-old
    son, john, and young''s 22-year-old son, jeff, were killed in the oct. 23, 1983,
    terrorist bombing of the marine corps headquarters where 241 marines died one
    sunday morning as they slept. the newsletter was created by the two mothers so
    that the men who died on a "peacekeeping mission" in war-torn beirut would not
    be forgotten. and, young says, so that the families would not feel alone and that
    all the american veterans of beirut would be "thought of with the 3 r''s: respect,
    reverence and remembrance." "these boys are our newest veterans," says subscriber
    james clark, of minong, wis., whose son, randy, was killed in an earlier rocket
    attack on the marine corps compound at the beirut airport. "i''m afraid these
    boys have been pushed aside by the public. i mean forgotten-the ones who died
    there and the ones who survived," clark says. "they got shot at, but they couldn''t
    fire back. they were targets, but nobody in our government would admit they were
    targets. they served honorably, but it wasn''t a war. what was it, i ask? and
    what did we ever accomplish? who''s even remembering beirut?" "i remember it well,"
    says john zurakowski, randy clark''s best friend in the marines, reflecting on
    the barracks attack. "at the time, our company was stationed up on the hill at
    beirut university. it was early sunday morning, and we were on holiday routine.
    i heard this big explosion that woke me up, and i went and sat down on some stairs
    and smoked a cigarette. a guy with binoculars came down from the building roof
    and said, ''you know the battalion headquarters that you can see from here? it''s
    not there anymore.'' " zurakowski, who was 19 when he was sent to beirut and is
    now out of the marines, says that while it was right in principle for the marines
    to go there, the rules of ducking and not shooting back confused him and his buddies.
    "we could have made a difference, but it didn''t work," he says. "the lebanese
    army had no discipline. they would smoke and drink all night while they were on
    duty. we often got artillery rounds fired at us with no fuses, and we figured
    it was the lebanese army shooting at us so we would get mad and do their fighting
    for them. it sort of made you wonder what was going on there." "none of us understood
    what was going on in beirut . . . not really," muffler says. "the parents all
    got letters that said, ''everything was okay, don''t worry, can''t wait to get
    home.'' "then came the explosion, and our sons were killed. i found nine families
    in philadelphia who''d lost their sons, and we all got together in december of
    1983 and it felt so good to talk to each other. "we had nothing of our sons. no
    pictures. no scrapbooks. no articles of clothing because it all went up with the
    building. so we thought of contacting other families and asked the government
    to give us their names. the government said they could not because of the privacy
    act." a friend suggested that the two women write columnist dear abby to appeal
    to other families who were spread out all across the country. abby called their
    houses and put the message in her column, and the letters flooded in from everywhere-from
    mothers, wives, sisters and brothers, from marines who served in beirut and from
    those who survived the explosion. "the letters were so touching, so passionate,
    and the writers of these letters were in such need to communicate with somebody
    else who''d had the beirut experience that we put together the beirut connection,"
    muffler says. the newsletter has been growing ever since. it now goes to 38 states,
    jamaica and puerto rico and has a subscription list of 402. families used to pay
    for their subscriptions by sending stamps. they now pay $3 a year. families write
    of small plaques that have gone up in their hometowns in memory of the "boys from
    beirut," gossip is passed, photographs are exchanged, poems are shared. a grief-stricken
    wife writes of her marine husband who killed himself shortly after his return
    from beirut. a young former marine wounded in the explosion writes of how his
    state does not consider him a veteran wounded in war because beirut was not a
    war, it was merely a mission. "the newsletter has been therapy for all of us,"
    muffler says. "and i think we all feel better for it. but we are going to have
    a new emphasis now. that is for the survivors. "they are still young and they
    don''t talk much yet about what they saw there. probably because it hurts. i had
    a friend of my son who wrote me several letters. he always sounded so down in
    those letters, and i asked him why. he responded that he felt he died with his
    friends. then he packed his things and moved, and i''ve never heard from him again.
    "the ones who lived, the veterans of beirut, need to be heeded, too . . . like
    the rest of america''s living veterans," young says. "we don''t want these men
    to feel forgotten or excluded."'

    tomorrow will mark the 11th annual great american smokeout, a one-day campaign
    to encourage smokers to quit smoking for 24 hours-just to prove they can do it.
    the idea was conceived by the american cancer society, which insists that anyone
    who can live without a cigarette for 24 hours can quit forever. during the 1986
    great american smokeout, a record-breaking 23.8 million smokers tried to quit
    for the day. this represents more than 43 percent of the nation''s 54.5 million
    smokers. lung cancer is the no. 1 cause of cancer death among both women and men.
    an estimated 92,000 men and 44,000 women will die of lung cancer in 1987. breast
    cancer used to be the biggest killer for women-now it''s lung cancer! a congressional
    study has reported that health costs from the adverse effects of smoking have
    reached a new high of $100 billion a year in increased medical bills and lost
    productivity. the loss in death and disability cannot be measured. (and how does
    one measure the amount of heartache, remorse and guilt suffered as a result of
    a preventable, self-induced tragedy?) what about "secondhand" smoke? is it actually
    damaging to non-smokers to be in the presence of those who are smoking? yes! furthermore,
    studies reveal that the children of smokers are more prone to lung problems and
    allergies than are children of non-smokers. for years i have begged my young readers,
    "if you smoke, quit now. if you don''t smoke, don''t start!" yet an estimated
    3,000 to 5,000 kids light up for the first time every day. why? peer pressure,
    no doubt. quitting "cold turkey" is the hardest way to quit, but my readers have
    told me it''s the most effective, and in the long run, the easiest way. cutting
    down is less traumatic, but the temptation to smoke is often too powerful to resist
    while smoking just one, two or three cigarettes a day. those who are heavily addicted
    may require professional help to break the habit. so, if you''re hooked on cigarettes,
    and have been telling yourself, "one of these days i''m going to quit," why not
    start tomorrow-just for 24 hours? it won''t be easy, but it will be the best thanksgiving
    present you can give yourself-and those who love you. p.s. a favor, please? if
    you quit tomorrow even for 24 hours, i want to hear from you. then write again
    and let me know how long you were able to stay clean. good luck. keep me posted.
    i care.'

    this letter is in regard to "steaming in georgia," who had passed around a family
    album for visiting relatives to enjoy. she observed one "in-law" looking at two
    pictures of her husband and his first wife for a very long time. then after everyone
    had left, she noticed that those two pictures had been removed from the album.
    "steamed" was sure wife no. 2 had taken them, and asked how to handle that situation
    at the next family gathering. you suggested she stand guard while guests looked
    at the album. not very helpful, abby. i am also wife no. 2, whose mother-in-law
    keeps pictures of her son and wife no. 1 in an album permanently displayed on
    her coffee table. this offended me. after six years, i finally told my husband
    how i felt about it. it wasn''t as though his mother didn''t have any pictures
    of her son and me together. after all, we have taken her on several vacation trips
    with us, and took plenty of pictures, which she has-but none are in her album.
    couldn''t you have said a few words in defense of wife no. 2? j.o. in minnesota'

    holidays with the family of a girl i''d been dating for about six months. we liked
    each other a lot, but i was in no position to make any kind of commitment. well,

    so far you have given your son a car for his 18th birthday. he totaled it after
    three days. you gave him another car, which he totaled in two months. you gave
    him a chance for a college education. he dropped out in his sophomore year. you
    paid for the diamond ring that he gave his fiancee. he then broke the engagement,
    she returned the ring, and he hocked it and kept the money. and now you ask me
    if you should borrow on your home to put this son in business. my answer is an
    unqualified no! give him one more gift: a chance to prove that he is a man. let
    him find his own job, stick to it, and learn how to stand on his own two feet.

    would you please devote some space to the subject of crime prevention? though
    crime has been on the increase for years, there are some things we can do to avoid
    becoming victims: start or join a neighborhood watch or rural watch program. the
    programs work well to increase citizen awareness and better communication between
    neighbors and law enforcers. secure your residence, place of business and vehicle.
    (almost half of all burglaries and thefts occur because of unlocked doors and
    windows, or keys left in car ignitions!) mark all your valuables with an engraving
    pen (available from your local police), and display an "operation identification"
    decal to warn would-be burglars and thieves that your property is marked and can
    be easily traced by law enforcement agencies. learn about personal safety, and
    rape and assault prevention. start or join a block/safe home for children program
    in the area you live to protect children from becoming victims of crime. how?
    it''s as easy as contacting the crime prevention officer at your local law enforcement
    agency to learn more about protecting yourself and your community from crime.
    law enforcement alone cannot prevent crime. you need them, and they need you!

    your reply: "they could be lonely, hungry, nosy or curious. or all of the above."

    the person who accepted them as they were, regardless of their education, clothing,

    the other day, my wife and daughter and i were talking about our daughter''s upcoming

    you want in your wedding party just pick out the prettiest dress they have hanging
    in their closets and wear it? for those who don''t have one or can''t afford to
    buy one, let them borrow one of yours, or another friend''s. guys rent tuxedos

    thanksgiving day, so take a few minutes to think about what you have to be thankful
    for. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived this long.
    a lot of people haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands-maybe millions-are hurting
    more. (have you ever visited a veterans hospital? or a hospital for crippled children?)
    if you awakened this morning and were able to hear the birds sing, use your vocal
    cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast table on two good legs and
    read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one), praise the lord! a lot of
    people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world is a lot
    poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security. no medicare.
    in fact, one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are
    you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, pick up
    the phone and call somebody. go out of your way to do something nice for somebody.
    it''s a sure cure for the blues. are you concerned about your country''s future?
    hooray! our system has been saved by such concern. concern for fair play under
    the law. if you don''t like your elected officials, you can go to work and vote
    them out of office. we still have the soapbox and the ballot box. or would you
    rather be in central america, ethiopia or afghanistan? freedom rings! you can
    still worship at the church of your choice, or not worship at all. you can cast
    a secret ballot, and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on
    the head or a knock on your door in the middle of the night. and if you want to
    live under a different system, goodbye and good luck! you are free to go. there
    are no walls or fences to keep you here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving
    prayer; perhaps you will want to use it at your table tomorrow: o, heavenly father:
    we thank thee for food and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember
    the sick. we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee
    for freedom and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service
    that thy gifts to us may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving,
    and may god bless you and yours. love, abby an afterthought: want an instant high?
    the surest cure for the post- holiday blues is to do something nice for someone.
    why not call someone who lives alone and invite him (or her) over for dinner?
    better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get
    home." (many older people don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out
    alone after dark.) p.s. special greetings to those of you in the military who
    wrote from remote corners of the world to tell me that you are using my thanksgiving
    prayer. do you hate to write letters because you don''t know what to say? thank-

  body: 'dear readers: well, are the christmases getting closer together or does it
    just seem that way? it''s time to start preparing for the holidays again, so do
    yourselves a favor and do your christmas or hanukkah shopping early. here''s my
    annual-slightly revised-column on holiday shopping. if you''re wondering what
    to give aunt olivia or grandpa, who doesn''t go out much, let me tell you what
    not to give them: forget dusting powder, after-shave and cologne. (they probably
    have several unopened boxes gathering dust on their closet shelves.) grandpa doesn''t
    need another necktie, and aunt sylvia doesn''t really want any more brooches,
    necklaces, bracelets or earrings. with the price of groceries so high, older folks
    who live alone on a fixed income would be delighted to receive a basket of goodies.
    include small cans of salmon, chicken, ham, tuna, fruit, instant coffee, tea bags,
    crackers, cookies and instant soup mixes. older people who live in confined quarters
    do not need more "things" that are ornamental only. don''t send music boxes, statuettes
    or other bric-a- brac. a truly thoughtful gift: postcards and some lined stationery
    with envelopes and a generous supply of postage stamps. (enclose some felt-tip
    pens, too.) a handy gift: an assortment of greeting cards for all occasions, so
    that they, too, can send birthday, anniversary, graduation, get-well and condolence
    cards to others. don''t give a gift of clothing unless you''re absolutely sure
    the size is right. if you''re tempted to pass along a scarf, purse, wallet or
    some little doodad you received three christmases ago, please don''t; the recipient
    will probably find it just as useless as you did. (besides, you might get it back
    the year after next.) if someone on your gift list is living on a pension, a check
    for any amount would be far more appreciated than some useless little trinket.
    another thoughtful gift would be a year''s subscription to a newspaper or magazine
    you are sure he or she will enjoy. if you buy a gift on sale, be sure it''s appropriate,
    since if the recipient tries to exchange it, he will be told, "sorry, sale merchandise
    is not returnable." never give a pet to anyone unless you''re absolutely sure
    a pet is wanted and will be properly cared for. and if you want to delight someone
    who considers his pet a "member of the family," include a tin or two of cat or
    dog food for the pet. don''t give wine or liquor unless you''re sure the recipients
    imbibe. candy, nuts and fruitcake make wonderful gifts for those who aren''t counting
    calories, but please have compassion for those who are, and lead them not into
    temptation. also remember that many older people have difficulty chewing hard
    candies and nuts. instead of giving someone a gift with permission to "take it
    back and exchange it if it''s not what you want," save yourself (and them) time
    and effort by giving gift certificates in the first place. for those who maintain
    their own homes and apartments, consider a gift certificate for other types of
    service needed-window washing and rug cleaning. and don''t forget certificates
    for the barber shop, beauty parlor, taxi rides or dinner out to a fine restaurant.
    and (don''t laugh) a trip to the podiatrist! holiday time can be depressing for
    people who are alone, so if you know someone who might be alone and lonely, give
    him (or her) the best gift of all- an invitation to have a holiday meal with you
    and your family. loneliness is the ultimate poverty. love, abby'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    a year ago i started dating a man i had known for years. i''ll call him bob. bob
    had just broken his engagement to "marilyn," a woman he had been living with for
    a couple of years. after they broke up, she left town. the first time i stayed
    overnight at bob''s home, i noticed an 8-by-10- inch picture of marilyn hanging
    in the corner of his bedroom. three months later i heard that marilyn had committed
    suicide. after that the picture was even more disturbing, but i didn''t want to
    mention it at such a sensitive time. bob kept moving it around-on top of the tv,
    then on his dresser at the foot of his bed. i finally told bob that the first
    thing i saw when i woke up in the morning was marilyn''s face, and it made me
    uncomfortable. the next time i stayed at bob''s, i noticed that marilyn''s picture
    had been moved to its original spot on his bedroom wall, where it remains. i realize
    that it''s his home, but i think the picture of an old flame-no matter how serious
    the relationship had been-belongs in an album or a drawer, out of sight. what
    are your thoughts on this? please answer soon. this has gone on far too long.

    please, am i being too sensitive, or is it just plain rudeness on the bride''s
    part? i am about to marry a man who has three daughters-all grown. several months
    ago, his eldest daughter was married. he took me to the wedding. his daughter
    insisted that her father be in the group pictures- standing next to his ex-wife.
    not only that, but he had to have the first dance with her and stand in the receiving
    line next to her, which i thought was rather tacky since he had nothing to do
    with the wedding. also, i resented being left alone while all this was going on.
    i thought once a man is divorced, he doesn''t have to play the part of a "husband."
    do i have to go through this with the other two daughters when they get married?

    i expect the christmas holidays will be a lonely time-my own choice. although

    for one reason: chain-smokers make the air lethal. last year i spent the day after
    christmas taking costly tests to determine that my chest pains, irregular heartbeat
    and inability to breathe were not a heart attack, but severe acute bronchitis,
    induced by several hours in a smoke-filled room. i never told my hostess this;
    she''s a chain-smoker. abby, i will be a hermit forever rather than risk that
    again. the pain is unbelievable. to ask people to refrain from smoking in their
    own homes is unthinkable. they would defend their right to smoke, and my right
    to stay home! if i ask people not to smoke in my home, they won''t accept my invitations.
    since families consist of both smokers and non-smokers, this is a socially divisive
    issue. tell me, abby, how do you and your readers handle it? still breathing'

    dating a "wonderful" boyfriend since her junior year. he lives in her college
    town where he owns a restaurant. we were happy to hear of this. they were talking

    with lisa for a weekend or holiday visit. he was always "tied up" at the restaurant,
    which seemed logical so we didn''t question it. we had assumed that he was around
    lisa''s age. last week i found out this man is 12 years older than lisa, has been
    married for nine years and has three children! the bearer of this news was his
    wife. she phoned me, yelling and cursing and using the dirtiest language i had
    ever heard. she claims our daughter knew he was married when she met him, but
    she went after him anyway. my husband and i drove down to see lisa. she was in
    tears, had lost weight and looked crushed. she told us she thought he was single
    when they first met, then he told her he was married but separated, and his "divorce"
    was in the works but his wife was giving him a hard time because of the children.
    now it seems that he went back to his wife-she''s forgiven him, and he told lisa

    lake shore drive drawing room, kissed each other on the lips and told tales of
    staying up giggling till 4 a.m. the night before and together "killing" three-quarters
    of a pralines ''n'' cream ice cream pie before shuffling off to bed. eppie, you
    see, threw a little tea for popo for popo has just compiled a booklet for her
    readers called "dear abby''s favorite recipes." as eppie explained to her guests:
    "i read a squib in her column that she was coming out with this booklet, not a
    book, and i thought, ''well i have parties for my friends'' books all the time;
    so why not a tea for my sister.'' i called her up and she said, ''i think that
    would be terrific.'' "at first," popo jumped in to correct her sister, "i said,
    ''are you crazy?'' " eppie went right ahead. "i really got my list out of best
    friends. i called 52 and 50 said yes. my sister said, ''four o''clock tea, who
    will come?'' "i said, ''everyone. the women will do their shopping at saks or
    somewhere and then come by.'' and now, i want to introduce you to my twin sister,
    popo. as betty corbally said just now when she walked in the door, ''you two must''ve
    been the cutest little things in the buggy.'' " with that, the sisters squeezed
    hands, and popo said a few words before the ladies returned to the petite mocha
    eclairs: "when you tell people that you''ve met eppie''s twin sister, abby, they
    will say, ''do they speak?'' do we speak? we don''t shut up. i can attest to that."
    the ladies chuckled. sterling spoons tinkled against china. the clock on the mantle
    chimed five times. everyone soon departed, charmed by the genteel twosome who
    hailed from sioux city, ia., and went on to advise the world. goodman blesses
    everyone with ''christmas carol'' it must be time for mistletoe and holly and
    stories of scrooge. it simply must be because wednesday night at the goodman theatre
    a whole audience of kiddies were nestled snug in their seats, many of them boosted
    for a better view by virtue of folded raincoats or overstuffed briefcases. and
    while a whole cast of crachits and christmas ghosts-past, present and yet to come-unspooled
    "a christmas carol" for the 10th year in a row, a whole gallery of little voices
    spilled forth a commentary that sometimes rivaled the action on stage. when someone
    on stage called the crachits "poor and destitute," a 5- year-old front and center
    echoed to her father, "poor and what?" when clouds of fog rolled onto the stage
    from the wings, a 6-year-old wondered loudly, "how do they do that?" one of the
    most curious in the house-one whose questions kept a whole knot of viewers giggling
    around him-was max adler, 3. max''s father is a theater critic, and young max
    exhibited that he, too, could question the theater. "this is his first big show.
    he doesn''t know the conventions yet, like how to keep quiet," said max''s slightly
    blushing father, tony, as he followed his son from his seat to the coke line at
    the end of act 1. no matter, though, all the chatter from the house. it''s all
    a part of the play. "thank god people procreate," said irving markin, chairman
    of the chicago theatre group''s board of trustees. "it gives us a market each
    year for this show. you expect this from the goodman. it''s a part of the season."
    wednesday''s night''s opening of "a christmas carol" was also the 10th anniversary
    party of the chicago theatre group inc., which has supported the goodman since
    it broke from the art institute in 1977. and although the tuxedoed guests of ctg
    enjoyed a candle-lit meal before the play, it was the cast party following ebenezer''s
    enlightenment that really hopped with the holiday spirit. besides max, who was
    not to be slowed despite the near-midnight hour, there was 5-year-old kevin duda,
    who got time off from kindergarten to play tiny tim for the next 30 shows and
    who had nothing to say about being a star except that it was "fine." while the
    little ones darted in and out of the crowd and occasionally found themselves scooped
    up to big peoples'' shoulders, mr. scrooge, played for the ninth season by william
    j. norris, sat limp in a chair, sipping on ice water, and mused about the impact
    of the story he calls a "family classic." "schuunk, it gets me in the heart every
    time," he said, striking a fist to his chest. "my hope is that everybody is touched.
    it''s not a children''s story; it''s a family story. my hope is that parents don''t
    drop children off and take a two-hour vacation. i come back every year to do scrooge.
    why? i gotta get it right." they''re 8 perfect little kids jeanne farnan wandered
    wide-eyed about the teak-paneled conrad hilton suite on the 29th floor of the
    chicago hilton and towers tuesday night. the 4- foot-4 6th grader from bridgeport
    catholic academy could not conceal her amazement at her surroundings. she rubbed
    her palm over the medieval tapestry hanging from the wall. she bent her neck all
    the way back to where her hairbow touched her angel''s wings so she could count
    the crystals in the chandelier. she stood on her tiptoes so she could eye the
    deep-fried shrimp sizzling in the sterling silver chafing dish. then she discovered
    the winding staircase behind the buffet table, and she could not help but whisper:
    "the bedrooms must be down there. if they pay this much money for the apartment,
    they''re not going to sleep on the couch." so went 11-year-old jeanne farnan''s
    debut with chicago''s swankiest circles. for the 50 or so ceos and their wives
    milling about the penthouse suite before the boys and girls clubs of chicago annual
    award dinner, this was just another ho-hum soiree where shrimp is supposed to
    be oversized, champagne is expected to be free-flowing and, of course, all the
    best baubles are brought out from the bank vault. but for jeanne and seven other
    pint-sized club members invited to escort the eight women being honored as chicagoans
    of the year, this was downright unbelievable. even though the winged collar on
    11-year-old eddie robertson''s rented tuxedo was "itching like crazy," and even
    though jeanne was "scared as heck" about singing the national anthem in front
    of lyric opera''s ardis krainik (never mind the other 1,038 guests), the kids
    agreed that being at the party was a whole lot better than being at home with
    "moonlighting" and a plate of spaghetti-os. "i''ve never seen so much jewelry
    in my entire life," jeanne whispered, continuing her social commentary half hidden
    behind one of the suite''s 12- foot-high chintz curtains. "last year my teacher
    got married and she had a diamond and i thought it was really huge. you come here
    and it''s like it was a grain of sand." one other thing jeanne observed: "everything
    here is so critical. you have to act the right way, talk the right way, eat the
    right way. you can''t say things you''d usually say. lord knows, you have to be
    perfect." caption: photo: ann landers and abigail van buren: advisers to the world.

    i just read the letter from "learned the hard way," who said he had several thousands
    of dollars in gold coins hidden in a shoe box in his closet until his wife accidentally
    tossed the box out. if that turkey believes his wife''s story, he''s an absolute
    idiot. first, what wife is going to throw out a shoe box hidden in her husband''s
    closet without checking the contents? also, that box had to be suspiciously heavy
    with "several thousands of dollars in gold coins," so it''s hard to believe his
    wife would toss it out without opening it. i say the wife either now has the gold
    coins stashed in a secret hiding place or in a safe-deposit box at the bank in

    the letter from "learned the hard way" reminded me of this: many years ago when
    i was a traveling salesman in sioux city, ia., i needed a little cash to go on
    the road, so i asked my wife if she had any. she said she didn''t, so later that
    day i borrowed some. i then went to take a shower before leaving town and found
    $200 in bills hidden in the back of the linen closet. i stuck it in my pocket
    and took off. a few days later my wife asked me if i found some money in the linen
    closet. i said, "how could i find it if there wasn''t any?" we are now divorced.

    you told "upset parent," who objected to the lack of moral supervision at college:
    "when a grown child goes off to college, parents cannot expect the authorities
    there to assume guardianship of their children''s sexual behavior." abby, the
    college authorities have a responsibility to provide living quarters that are
    free of drugs, alcohol and a brothel atmosphere. every generation of college administrators
    has probably found enforcing dormitory rules a headache, but the current generation
    is the first to "turn the zoo over to the animals." our young people are being
    exposed to sexual stimulation at an age when their hormones need no nudging. why
    should we make it easy for them? look into the matter. you will be shocked by
    what is going on in 95 percent of our colleges. men and women live on the same
    floor, share the same bathrooms and showers; they are openly sleeping together,
    and nobody blinks an eye! another upset parent'

    my husband and i traveled more than 200 miles last week to attend his mother''s
    memorial service. the night before the service, the family (seven of us) decided
    to have dinner at a chinese restaurant. we took along "roger," our 6-month-old
    son who is still colicky at times. after we had placed our order, roger became
    very fussy, so we tried to comfort him by holding him. my husband even took him
    outside for a while. when he brought him back, he started to cry very loudly again,
    so we thought if we put him in his car seat beside us, he might settle down by
    himself. there were only 14 people in the restaurant besides our party, but the
    waitress came over and told us that her customers were leaving because our baby''s
    crying was disturbing them. my husband got upset, canceled our order, and we left.
    abby, did we overreact by walking out? or should the waitress have approached
    the situation differently? i always thought a restaurant was there to serve customers,
    including those with fussy babies. what is your opinion? roger''s mom'

    in answer to the "waitress in banff" who asks why people seem to prefer "dirty"
    tables: they don''t necessarily prefer "dirty" tables; the choice tables are occupied

    restaurant designers have long known, that people will fill a restaurant in a

    him she had never seen before, and it made me feel a lot better. i did not divorce

    authorities on human behavior tell us that fantasizing is normal, healthy and
    beneficial in achieving the ultimate in sexual satisfaction. as a woman who has
    been faithfully married to the same man for 22 years, i find this to be true.
    it is only natural for a husband or wife to grow bored with a spouse (sexually)
    after a number of years. sex therapists recommend "pretending" (or fantasizing)
    that we are making love to our favorite entertainer-or even a personal acquaintance.
    now i ask you to consider this: somewhere in the bible it says that thinking lustful
    thoughts is as great a sin as actually committing the sin. so if that is the case,
    why not go right ahead and commit the sin? afraid to fantasize in chickasha, okla.'

    allen (not his real name) and i have been happily married for 14 years. we own
    our own business and do quite well. allen has never been very particular about
    shaving and showering daily for work or before we make love. i keep myself very
    neat and clean at all times. i''ve hinted several times that i wish he''d clean
    up more, but he never takes the hint. maybe i should be more blunt, but i hate
    to hurt his feelings. a few months ago we hired an attractive young woman to help
    us out at work on mondays, wednesdays and saturdays. allen immediately started
    to shower, shave and dress up on those days. he even started to wear cologne-but
    only on the days she works with us. there have been no signs that there is anything

    this is in response to "upset parent," who blasted the lack of supervision in
    our colleges today. i went to a university that had "rules," but nobody paid any
    attention to them, which is the way most colleges are run nowadays. but the best
    experience i got out of my college years was learning to think for myself and
    sticking to my high moral values regardless of what other people did. i may not
    have been the most popular girl in madison, wis., between 1972 and 1976, but i
    earned a lot of self-respect and i''m sure i gained more than i lost. mary louise,

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    hawkshaw here has been attempting to offer some preliminary conclusions on the
    signing of free agents, which, at first glance, seems to be going apace-seven
    players have made new connections; also, to report if there has been progress
    in the awarding of damages to the players for the their union''s successful 1985
    collusion grievance, an arbitrator having determined the owners were guilty of
    conspiring to prevent a free market. second things first: at the winter meetings
    in dallas the week before last, the members of the owners'' player relations committee
    met for two hours. among other things a settlement was discussed. no vote, no
    agreement, only talk. the result of our survey produced the following: one owner
    acknowledged $10 million was mentioned, but nothing higher. a second owner acknowledged
    $15 million was mentioned, but nothing higher. a third owner acknowledged $20
    million was mentioned, but nothing higher. reminds me of the dear abby column
    when a woman, who was looking for a husband, said she had been dating a stockbroker.
    on their first date, he said he was 61 years old; second date, he said he was
    59; on the third, he dropped it to 57. what should she do? abby''s reply: when
    he gets to 55, sell! all of the owners offered these figures with the understanding
    they would remain anonymous. this is because of the traditional cloak of silence.
    to speak publicly not only would endanger relations with their fellow owners but
    invite the possibility of disciplinary action by comissioner peter ueberroth.
    a call was put through to don fehr, the executive director of the major league
    players association. going high, i said, mr. fehr, how does $20 million hit you?
    his reply: "their proposals have had to do with a package settlement for both
    years-''85 and ''86 (the identical ''86 grievance is now being heard)-but we haven''t
    reached the stage of seriously discussing numbers (dollars), because the association
    cannot settle these cases until there is a real market for the current free agents.
    and in our opinion, there isn''t a free market." the translation: if the owners
    reach agreement on a settlement, which isn''t likely, the union will say, in effect,
    "whoa now! we want to see what happens this year." which means arbitrator tom
    roberts, eventually, will decide (without realistic recommendations from either
    side) the extent of the penalty. roberts'' decision could come next spring, next
    summer, maybe next christmas, further evidence the wheels of justice move slowly.
    as for the 1987 free agents, there has been the following movement, in alphabetical
    order: - outfielder brett butler from cleveland to san francisco. - outfielder
    bob dernier, cubs to philadelphia. - outfielder chili davis, san francisco to
    california. - outfielder mike davis, oakland to los angeles. - outfielder dave
    henderson, san francisco to oakland (to be announced). - infielder vance law,
    montreal to cubs. - pitcher david palmer, allanta to philadelphia. a total of
    16 free agents have re-signed with their former clubs, or have agreed to salary
    arbitration, which is the same as re-signing, the only difference being an arbitrator
    will determine their 1988 pay. they are: - pitcher juan berenguer, minnesota.
    pitcher gene garber, kansas city. pitcher mark clear, milwaukee. outfielder dave
    collins, cincinnati. outfielder ken griffey, atlanta. catcher mike heath, detroit.
    pitcher tommy john, yankees. pitcher dave lapointe, white sox. outfielder lee
    mazzilli, mets. outfielder jerry mumphrey, cubs pitcher joe price, san francisco.
    pitcher dave righetti, yankees. pitcher bryn smith, montreal. pitcher frank tanana,
    detroit. infielder manny trillo, cubs. pitcher mike witt, california. together,
    23, or approximately one-third of the 76 free agents, are accounted for. is the
    union''s fehr satisfied with the early results? "no, i''m not satisified," he
    said. "you just can''t look at whether somebody moves or signs with his former
    club. what you have to ask is, has there been meaningful competition for free
    agents? or is it ''controlled collusion''? there is no doubt the clubs will not
    be as blatant as in the past. overall, i would have to say we have not seen a
    free market. in almost all instances the players who signed with new clubs were
    not wanted by their former clubs." whatever, crunch time is still two weeks away.
    midnight jan. 8 is the deadline for the retaining clubs to sign their free agents
    who have rejected arbitration. a half-dozen extremely attractive players, all-stars
    all, are in this group. alive but spending christmas out in the cold are third
    baseman gary gaetti, minnesota; first baseman jack clark, st. louis; infielder
    paul molitor, milwaukee; and pitchers jack morris, detroit; charlie liebrandt,
    kansas city; and dave smith, houston. the competition for these players should
    determine the extent of the free market. until then, hawkshaw reserves judgment.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    as a daily reader (male), may i share my experience with christmas presents? before
    i retired, i was an executive with one of the largest chain stores in maryland.
    a co-worker (woman) kindly answered my phone when i was out of the office. she
    also took messages for me, and i did her many favors, too, so we exchanged christmas
    presents. (incidentally, she had the reputation of being very tight with a buck.)
    one christmas she told me her husband had received a "soap-on-a-rope" and she
    couldn''t stand the fragrance. guess what she gave me for christmas the following
    year? that foul-smelling soap-on-a-rope! a few days after that christmas, she
    showed me and a few other guys in the office an ugly black necktie with a lot
    of scrollwork and various doodads painted on it. she said her husband wouldn''t
    be caught dead in that tie. of course, i received it from her the following christmas!
    now here''s the payoff. she told me that she and her husband had received a large
    box of assorted, individually wrapped cheeses for christmas. one of my co-workers
    was there and heard how terrible the cheese was, and i bet him a dollar i would
    get it for christmas the next year. of course, i won the bet. on new year''s day,
    my wife and i decided to try some of the assorted cheeses. abby, they were so
    old we couldn''t even get the paper off any of them. i''m sure others have had
    similar experiences with recycled gifts. if you use this, sign me "blue eyes."
    she will know who i am when she reads this-if she isn''t too tight to buy a copy
    of the baltimore morning sun. now in catonsville, md.'

    good friends keep in touch. according to doug collins, he and his good buddy mike
    fratello were burning up the long-distance lines earlier this season. in fact,
    after collins was named coach of the month for leading the bulls to a 10-3 record
    in november, there was a congratulatory call from atlanta coach fratello. that
    was then. the bulls were hot; the hawks were not. this is now. the bulls have
    lost four in a row; the hawks have won seven of eight. when collins spots fratello
    tuesday night before the bulls and hawks wage war above the stadium''s rims, he
    is going to give his good buddy a little grief. "wait ''til i see him," collins
    said with a smile. "when he was going bad, i listened to his problems and tried
    to encourage him. but now that he''s okay, and we''re struggling, i haven''t heard
    from him. i played ann landers for him? now, where''s my dear abby? where''s mike
    fratello now? "i get up in the morning now to get a cup of coffee at the convenience
    mart and it''s like, i pull my coat collar up, duck my head and tug my hat down
    real low over my face. i sneak around. before, in a loud voice, it was, ''hey,
    everyone, how are you? i''m doing fine, just ask!'' " "we''ve struggled so hard
    to win each game that it''s taken extra effort on the coach''s part," said fratello.
    "i''ve been staying up late at night looking at films, burning the midnight oil,
    and i wasn''t sure if doug wanted me to call him at 5 a.m. "we are definitely
    going to get together. i was going to talk to him at the game because i deal better
    with people in person. tell doug i brought him his christmas present and i hope
    he''s got one for me." fratello might share with collins his method of pulling
    a team out of the doldrums. the hawks started slowly, losing to the bulls at the
    omni, which is still their only loss at home. back then, fratello said his team
    was out of sync and struggling to put its game together. his mood was patient,
    like that of an experienced trainer waiting for a thoroughbred to find its kentucky
    derby legs. win or lose, at some time tuesday, collins will probably seek encouragement
    from his friend. "mike fratello is a great guy to have in the league as a coach,"
    collins said. "he is so supportive of everyone in the league. he is president
    of the coaches association, and does whatever he can to help other coaches." collins
    pointed out that atlanta, boston and the los angeles lakers all went through slumps
    of varying degrees and are still residing near the top of the national basketball
    association. "but the difference between us and the hawks is one of experience
    to youth," collins said. "their team has been together a little longer than us.
    right now, our morale is down, very low. the guys have lost a lot of confidence.
    we''ll need a lot of encouragement from that stadium crowd tuesday night. i hope
    they get behind us." it would help if the real michael jordan reappeared. the
    slumping superstar wants to break loose from his 11-for-37 shooting of the last
    two games that netted a total of 33 points. "i''ve got to keep playing hard and
    keep shooting," jordan said. "i can''t get down on myself and not shoot the jumper.
    i took some extra shooting in practice today and concentrated on a few things.
    it felt like my jumper was back. "i won''t go looking for my shot. it''s something
    i won''t go chasing. but, if my first couple of shots fall tuesday night, i''ll
    be in a good mood. and hopefully, my jumper will be in a good mood." granville
    waiters was stranded monday in columbus, ohio, as a snowstorm closed o''hare international
    airport. he will be fined $250 for missing monday''s practice. "all the other
    guys made it," collins said. "i told the players they could go home for the holidays,
    but be back in town by sunday night because there was supposed to be bad weather
    monday morning. there''s no excuse." the hawks will be missing kevin willis, who
    has sat out two games with a sprained right knee. antoine carr was in a car accident
    after saturday''s victory over new york and visited a chiropractor monday to remedy
    a wrenched back. he is expected to play. cliff levingston replaces willis, coming
    off a 29-point, 17-rebound performance against the knicks. dominique wilkins was
    named player of the week by the nba after averaging 34 points a game, shooting
    52 percent from the field and 96 percent (28-of-29) from the free-throw line.
    meanwhile, indiana general manager donnie walsh said he was "still evaluating"
    the possibility of signing artis gilmore after the ex-bull center clears waivers
    at 2 p.m. tuesday. however, a source in the organization said "it''s doubtful"
    the pacers would make a move to acquire gilmore.'

    i am writing to you out of desperation. i am so depressed, i could slit my throat!
    my hair is my crowning glory, long, thick and beautiful- at least it was until
    yesterday when i went for a "trim," and my beautician chopped off at least 14
    inches of my glorious locks! she said she was just going to "even it up a little."
    i could hardly sleep last night, and when i did, i had nightmares. i''m not exaggerating.
    all my friends were horrified. this is not an isolated incident. whenever i go
    in for a trim, i ask that about two inches be taken off, and each and every time,
    the hairdresser cuts off too much, but yesterday was unbelievable. i am so upset,
    my hands are shaking. it will take years to grow back that 14 inches of hair.
    does this happen to other long-haired ladies? can i sue? this may seem trivial
    and silly to you, but i am ... devastated in san diego'

    i am 27 and my husband is 38. we''ve been married for a year. it''s my first marriage
    and "ryan''s" second. i fell head over heels in love with this man, and i know
    he loves me. he has two children by a previous marriage, living with their mother
    in another city. our marriage is perfect- except for one thing. ryan did not inform
    me before we were married that he had a vasectomy. abby, i love children, and
    it saddens me to know that i will never bear a child. ryan even saw an urologist
    hoping his vasectomy could be reversed, but he was told it couldn''t be done.
    i''m in counseling now to help me deal with this disappointment, but i still get
    spells of depression. oh, abby, tears are dropping on this letter as i write these
    words. can you help me? no baby of my own'

    i am a friendly, nice-looking young man in my mid-20s. for more than 10 years,
    as a teenager and young adult, i suppressed my natural urges, which were homosexual.
    it was a constant daily battle to stifle my feelings for men. never at any time
    did i have those feelings for a female. i knew that homosexuality would never
    be accepted by my family-or society. no one would ever suspect that i am gay.
    i have never had a homosexual experience and have never told anyone how i feel.
    a year and a half ago, i married a fine woman (my age), thinking this would force
    me to change and i would lose my desire for men. i was wrong. my feelings for
    men are stronger than ever, and i have no desire to have sex with my wife. little
    by little, i believe she is catching on. i am absolutely miserable being married.
    abby, i am well respected in my community and am active in my church. divorce
    is out of the question. no one has any idea what i am going through. are there
    other homosexuals who have given in to marriage and are miserable, or am i all
    alone? my secret'

    my fiance and i recently moved from new york to florida. "morey" and i are both
    divorced and look forward to having someone to share our lives with. he has friends
    and relatives here, whereas i have no one. part of the reason he moved to florida
    is because he loves to play golf. at first, he golfed either on saturday or sunday.
    however, lately he''s been golfing on both days. he''s gone from four to six hours
    at a crack, and when he gets home, he''s usually too tired to do anything because
    he got up so early. we''ve had some serious talks about his golfing, and he made
    it clear that he "loves" the sport, and if i become too resentful of his golfing,
    we will have problems. we both work full time during the week, and i think i''m
    entitled to have him all to myself one day a week. while he golfs, i stay home
    with my children (from a previous marriage) and do laundry and cleaning. am i
    being selfish and inconsiderate, or is he? morey''s golf widow'

    two years ago, but continued seeing her for fun and frolicking (sex) until he

    before jerry (not his real name) and i were married, he had a relationship with

    then they broke up and karen moved out of town. my problem: karen still remembers
    jerry''s birthday, sends cards, calls him and generally keeps in touch with him.
    (she''s not married.) when jerry and i became engaged (last september), i asked
    him to please cease all communication with karen; he said he would. well, karen
    called him at home and he took the call and talked to her in a very friendly way.
    after that, i told him that he should tell her point- blank he isn''t interested
    in maintaining any kind of contact with her. he says he doesn''t want to be rude
    to her. yesterday we received a wedding gift from karen. (we didn''t send her
    an announcement.) neither one of us wants the gift. should we send it back and
    say "no thanks," or should we keep it and thank her for it? should i write to
    her and tell her to stop keeping in touch with jerry, or should we just ignore
    her and hope she''ll go away? sick of karen'

    in answer to "still in love at 78"-the woman who loves to have her husband along
    to help her grocery-shop: it''s all fine and dandy to have a 24-hour relationship,
    but what are you going to do when one of the couple dies? a casual friend lost
    her husband after 46 years of marriage. she was lost-and still is, six years later.
    she has no club to go to, no special interests, no hobbies, no close women friends-in
    fact, she''s a very boring person to be around. all she does is moan about her
    loss and watch tv. i''ve tried to help her by suggesting she do volunteer work
    or take some courses, but she says it wouldn''t help. she just sits. r.m.c., california'

    in 1981 my husband drove a semi for a living, and i worked as a salesperson in
    a women''s apparel store. we have two children. most of my husband''s money went
    toward his truck payments and repairs on his truck, plus expenses for his trips.
    he destroyed his receipts and logs. when time came to do our taxes, my husband
    said he didn''t receive his w-2 forms but that it was okay to file without them
    and he would straighten the matter out later. needless to say, he didn''t. he
    never even attempted to get his w-2 forms. now the irs says we owe an enormous
    amount of money in back taxes and penalties! i am very angry because i have always
    paid my taxes. this idiot husband of mine says, "leave it alone, and they will
    forget about it." have you ever heard of the irs "forgetting" anything? we do

    this is in response to all those parents who are shocked at the "sexual promiscuity"
    going on in college dorms. i am currently a senior at the university of california-davis

    has been a marked decline in college morals, do these parents actually believe
    that college dorms are the first place their "children" were exposed to sexual
    promiscuity? most kids have experimented with drugs, drinking and sex in high
    school. some even started in junior high and grade school. if parents of college
    students are concerned, i suggest that they are about 10 years too late. morals
    and ethics are taught in the home, and no amount of college regulation and policing
    will control an already promiscuous student. robert at davis'

    "afraid to fantasize in chickasha, okla.," said that somewhere in the bible it
    said that thinking lustful thoughts was just as sinful as doing the deed, so why
    not go ahead and do the deed? the "somewhere" is in matthew 5:28, where jesus
    is quoted as saying, "i tell you that any man who looks at a woman to lust after
    her has already committed adultery with her in his heart." you said you had put
    that question to many theologians but never received a satisfactory explanation.
    may i try? jesus said both acts are sinful, but he did not say that they were
    equally wrong. for example, no one would say that the urge to strike one''s wife
    (which is sinful) is equally as grievous as beating her. obviously to follow through
    on a wrongful impulse is a far greater sin than the initial thought. the essence
    of christ''s advice: "nip it in the bud!" david m. lyles dallas'

    my wife never throws anything away. she saves everything! as a result, our attic
    is overloaded. i have told her repeatedly that we must get the attic straightened
    up. she says it doesn''t bother her-meanwhile, every year it gets more cluttered.
    i have offered to do the job myself, but that doesn''t meet with her approval
    because she''s afraid i might throw away something she wants to save. we are getting
    on in years, and if we don''t clean out this attic while we are still able to
    do it, our children will be stuck with the job, and i don''t think that would
    be fair to them. i am sure there are others who have this problem. any suggestions?

    but we need not hold it forever. did you know that there is an international forgiveness
    week? well, neither did i until last year, when alice parenti of fresno, calif.,
    wrote to tell me about it. it''s from feb. 1 through feb. 6. robert muller, former
    assistant secretary-general of the united nations, wrote this piece for international
    forgiveness week: decide to forgive decide to forgive for resentment is negative
    resentment is poisonous resentment diminishes and devours the self. be the first
    to forgive, to smile and to take the first step, and you will see happiness bloom
    on the face of your human brother or sister. be always the first do not wait for
    others to forgive. for by forgiving you become the master of fate the fashioner
    of life the doer of miracles. to forgive is the highest most beautiful form of
    love. in return you will receive untold peace and happiness. here is the program
    for achieving a truly forgiving heart: sunday: forgive yourself. monday: forgive
    your family. tuesday: forgive your friends and associates. wednesday: forgive
    across economic lines within your own nation. thursday: forgive across cultural
    lines within your own nation. friday: forgive across political lines within your
    own nation. saturday: forgive other nations. only the brave know how to forgive.

    we are a group of married couples. on saturday evenings, a group of 10 or 12 goes

    "roger''s mom" wrote of her experience in a restaurant with roger, her 6-month-old
    colicky boy who became fussy and cried a lot. the waitress politely informed "mom"
    that some customers were leaving because her baby was disturbing them, whereupon
    mom and her husband canceled their dinner order and left with the crying baby.
    she asked if you thought the waitress could have approached the situation in a
    different way. you rightfully replied, "how else could the situation be approached?
    i think the waitress acted appropriately." hooray for you, abby. last week, my
    husband and i hired a baby sitter so we could dine out on our 10th anniversary.
    our children are 1, 5 and 8. seated at the table next to us was a couple with
    a baby who appeared to be about 10 months old. the baby first whimpered, then
    cried, and finally screamed during most of the meal. the mother tried unsuccessfully
    to quiet the child-meanwhile the screaming continued. the place was filled, or
    we would have asked for another table. needless to say, it ruined our evening.
    how i wish the waitress would have approached those people and suggested that
    they take the crying child out until it settled down. everyone around us was upset.
    one couple left without finishing their meal. i think it is the height of insensitivity
    for parents to allow a child to carry on that way in a public dining room. disgusted

    we took it gladly. i played the piano and my husband was the choir director at

    woman who gave us this piano has long passed away, but yesterday we had a telephone
    call from someone who claimed to be her relative. she told my husband that someone
    in the family wanted that piano. she gave us her phone number and asked us to
    call her and tell her when they could pick it up. abby, that piano was given to
    us because the owner didn''t want it and didn''t know what else to do with it.

    incoming torpedo (or missile); we take the hit so the carrier can continue to
    fight. we''re also the ones who escort tankers in the persian gulf. we''ve been

    our son has been very kind to handle our retirement nest egg. several days before
    "bloody monday," he advised me to close out an account, send a bank wire for $8,000
    to a very conservative fund, and keep $2,000 cash just in case of a possible bank
    closing. i did as he recommended. we aren''t accustomed to having much cash around
    the house, so i put the envelope with the $2,000 in a wastebasket until i could
    think of a safe hiding place. you guessed it. i thoughtlessly emptied the wastebasket
    in the trash! i didn''t realize what i had done until the next morning. i didn''t
    call the garbage people because i figured it was hopeless; besides, i didn''t
    want to advertise the fact that we kept so much cash in the house. shortly afterward,
    a letter appeared in your column about the stash of gold coins hidden in a shoe
    box and accidentally thrown out. recently our son wrote and instructed me to deposit
    the $2,000 and send a cashier''s check to the fund. i can''t bring myself to tell

    last spring, a classmate of mine from high school (30 years ago) called to tell
    me that his wife had died. i had only seen him once since we were in high school,
    and that was five years ago at our 25th high school reunion. (he dated my sister
    a few times, but not me.) he lives about 60 miles from here. when he phoned, he
    said he had been thinking about me, and would love to get together. i said, "that
    would be nice; my husband and i would enjoy seeing you again." (i emphasized "my
    husband.") i told my husband and grown son, and they both think this man is coming

    will you do a favor for those of us who have hearing ear guide dogs? the public
    is well aware of seeing eye dogs, but not many have heard about dogs for the deaf.
    hearing ear dogs can be recognized by their bright orange collars and leashes.
    they are not any specific size or breed-they are just ordinary "mutts"-but they
    are trained to assist deaf persons with sound awareness. thus far 46 states have
    granted hearing ear dogs the same legal rights as those accorded to seeing eye
    dogs. they are permitted to go into hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, places
    of entertainment and wherever the general public is invited. they are also welcome
    to travel on trains, planes and buses. please tell your readers that if they see
    a dog with a bright orange collar and leash to please refrain from irritating
    looks and remarks. these dogs are trained guide dogs for the deaf. mrs. r.b. haney,

    in august 1969, i enrolled my daughter, sandy, in the university of maryland at
    college park. (it happens to be my alma mater.) although sandy had been accepted
    to several other fine colleges, maryland was her first choice. when we arrived,
    i was dumbfounded to learn that my daughter had been assigned living quarters
    with three other girls in half of a trailer-the other half was going to be occupied
    by four young men! well, i charged up to the office of the dean in charge of housing
    and asked why my daughter was not assigned to one of the dorms. he told me they
    were all filled-then a lecture on the "advantages" of trailer life on campus followed.
    he stated that his own daughter was going to live in one, whereupon i said, "mister,
    you can aid in the corruption of your daughter if you want to, but i''ll be damned
    if you''re going to corrupt mine!" then i demanded that he refund my money for
    room and board. he did. that afternoon we found a lovely apartment in the home
    of a very nice woman who offered sandy the run of her home. (she was the only
    student in the house.) abby, when more people stand up and tell these liberal
    idiots that they are not going to tolerate this kind of thing in our institutions

    i had to write to you after reading your response to "a private person in atlanta."
    it appears her company was offering their employees health insurance and one of
    their questions was: "at what age did you have your first sexual encounter?" she
    stated it was nobody''s business, left it blank, and you agreed with her. well,
    abby, that is a pertinent question for any company that takes on the health risks
    of women. the earlier a woman engages in sexual activity, the higher her risk
    for early development of cervical cancer. it is a scientific fact that women who
    have their first sexual intercourse at a young age are at greater risk for cervical
    cancer. i doubt that you will print this letter, but i think you should, not so
    much for "a private person in atlanta," but for all the adolescent women who are
    considering becoming sexually active. they should have as many of the facts as
    possible before making their decision. nick giannone, m.d., freeport, texas'

    it has been two months since my husband and i gave $25 to his brother and sister-in-law
    for their 40th wedding anniversary. we are still waiting for some kind of thank-you.
    (strange, they knew our address when they sent us the invitation.) when i mentioned
    this to my husband, he reminded me that we never did receive a thank-you from
    other relatives to whom we gave a gift for their 50th anniversary. upon telling
    our son this, he told us that at many celebrations where gifts are given, thank-you
    cards are placed on the gift table (where the guests leave their gifts), and the
    guests are supposed to pick up a thank-you card. this is the only thank-you they
    receive. would you call this "class" in the upper midwest or what? prior lake,

    i am the grandmother of two very active, mischievous children under 5 years old.
    they fight with each other constantly and are really a handful because they have
    not been properly disciplined. it''s not their fault- it''s the fault of their
    parents. four days ago while i was visiting, my son-in-law, who is a big, husky
    man with a violent temper, beat both children with his belt. i was there today,
    and the bruises are still visible! i can''t sleep. i spoke to my daughter about
    this, and she sided with her husband. they both think this is the only way to
    teach their children to obey. i have seen my daughter knock their little heads
    together and shake them until they were hysterical. what should i do? the parents
    deserve to be turned in for child abuse, but i''m afraid if i report them i''ll
    never see my grandchildren again. maybe if they see this letter in print, they
    will come to their senses. help me to help those kids. i''m sure you understand

  body: 'dear readers: well, i asked for it. last june (1987) i ran the following
    item: "readers, i need your cooperation for an important survey. question: have
    you ever cheated on your mate? how long have you been together? you need not sign
    your name, but please state your age, and indicate whether you are male or female.
    please send a postcard or letter." my office was promptly deluged with not only
    postcards, but letters-some very long ones-explaining why they cheated, or why
    they didn''t. (mostly why they did.) several readers asked me to define the word
    "cheated." one man wrote from portland, ore.: "would you call it cheating if the
    wife said, ''i don''t care what you do as long as you don''t bother me''?" others
    acknowledged open marriages: "i go my way, he goes his-no questions asked-so since
    there is no cheating going on, are we eligible for this survey?" another free
    spirit put it more eloquently: "my wife and i are very much in love. we are also
    sophisticated, mature adults who realize that as we travel along life''s way,
    eventually we will meet others to whom we will be physically attracted, so rather
    than suppress the normal desire for sexual variety, we choose to express our healthy
    feelings openly-without denial or deception. would you call this ''cheating''?"
    good question. and the answer is yes. in my view, when two people wed, they vow
    to forsake all others until death do they part-not until they meet others to whom
    they are physically attracted. and to break that vow is indeed "cheating." ten
    weeks into the survey, marcia smith, a reporter for the dallas times herald called.
    "how''s your survey coming?" she asked. i told her that we still had unopened
    cartons of mail stacked to the ceiling, and it was still pouring in. then i added
    that although we were not tabulating cities or states, thus far, dallas respondents
    appeared to be confessing their infidelities in greater numbers than the national
    average. well, the following day, the dallas times herald ran a page one story
    headlined: "dallas a hotbed of sin, abby''s survey finds." naturally, dallas faithfuls
    came forward in droves, demanding to be counted. soon a bale of mail arrived from
    the dallas area, tilting the figures heavily in favor of the faithfuls. (you might
    call this stacking the deck- easily accomplished with a well-organized letter
    writing campaign.) one dallas couple wrote: "have a heart, abby. it''s bad enough
    that oil took a nosedive-now this! we''ve been together for 26 years, have been
    100 percent faithful to each other, and nobody in our circle of friends is fooling
    around either." many readers asked why i was taking this survey. a wisconsin woman
    wrote: "what will it prove? if the majority of married men admit to cheating,
    it will only comfort the cheaters, and encourage the faithful ones to cheat, too."
    another suggested that my survey would be flawed because in our culture it enhances
    a man''s macho image to claim numerous sexual conquests, and, as victorian as
    it may seem, it is not culturally acceptable for females to admit to sexual promiscuity.
    some of the letters i received were so funny, poignant and fascinating that reading
    them slowed down the tabulations. many couples married 50 years and longer sent
    their wedding anniversary pictures, proudly asking to be counted among those who
    "never cheated, never wanted to, never needed to and never expected to." the results
    of this survey astonished me. i learned that we are a far more moral society than
    most people thought we were. this postcard came from downers grove, ill.: "i''m
    82 years young, male, married 56 years and never cheated, but like jimmy carter,
    i confess to having lusted in my heart a time or two." from chicago: "i''m 52
    and female. married 15 years. never considered cheating, although i might change
    my mind if paul newman asked me." so, my friends, everyone is not cheating, and
    i have the figures to prove it. tomorrow: the results from a survey that brought
    210,336 responses from the usa and canada.'

  body: 'dear readers: last june i invited you to participate in a survey. the question:
    have you ever cheated on your mate? i received 210,336 responses: 149,786 from
    women, and 60,550 from men. the results were astonishing: 22,468 (or 15 percent)
    of the female respondents said they had been unfaithful, and 15,743 (or 26 percent)
    of the men admitted they had cheated. putting it in more positive terms: 85 percent
    (127,318) of the women said they had been faithful and 74 percent (44,807) men
    claimed fidelity. surprised? so was i. for all the recent publicity the media
    have given the cheaters, there are far more faithfully wed couples than i had
    surmised. face it, friends, well-behaved, law-abiding folks seldom make the morning
    headlines, the dear abby column or the evening news, even though they far outnumber
    the transgressors. i had expected mostly postcards, but more than half the respondents
    wrote letters. and although this was to be an anonymous survey, upward of two-thirds
    of the respondents-cheaters and non-cheaters alike-signed their names! the oldest
    respondent was a 99-year-old widower who described himself as a country doctor-now
    retired. he wrote: "i''ve had three wives and cheated on all of them. wife no.
    2 was the woman i cheated with while married to wife no. 1, who divorced me when
    she found out. when i was 66, wife no. 2 died; then i married the nurse i had
    been cheating with off and on during my first two marriages. (i also cheated on
    her until she died.) i was only 79 and still going strong, but i decided no more
    wives for me-only compatible housekeepers." the youngest respondents wrote from
    indiana: "we''re both 18, we''ve been married for three months but we went together
    for nearly three years, and we haven''t cheated yet." this heartwarming letter
    came from harrisburg, pa.: "thanks for asking. i am proud to say that in the 45
    years i''ve been married to this wonderful woman, i have never cheated. and this
    includes two years during which i served with the u.s. navy. i had no girl in
    any port! my upbringing and moral values would never have allowed me to live in
    peace should i have strayed. furthermore, i''m sure my wife can make the same
    statement." the most surprising revelation in this survey was the number of male
    bisexuals that surfaced. although mental health professionals in the past have
    estimated that 10 percent of the population is either gay or bisexual, my survey
    indicated that there are possibly twice that number. many are married with "fine
    families." "i am a 67-year-old male who has been homosexual (or bi) since i can
    remember. because of the social pressures of living in a small iowa town in the
    ''40s, i married and remained married until my wife died. while married, i cheated
    whenever i could find a willing partner." from a vermont wife: "married 36 years,
    we both had extramarital affairs. all mine were heterosexual, but i''m not sure
    about his." "i''m female, 49, now divorced. fourteen years ago i had an affair
    with a close friend of my husband''s. it lasted three years-until i caught him
    in bed with my husband. that ended my affair and also my marriage." many wrote
    at length to justify their affairs: "i was married to a wonderful man for 38 years.
    did i cheat? you bet i did! my husband was great at a lot of things, but a lover
    he wasn''t. back in those days nobody ever spoke about a woman''s need to be satisfied.
    i mentioned it a few times-even bought him a book on lovemaking-but he just looked
    at the pictures. he''s been dead for 13 years. i''m 72, and if i could find a
    decent man who wasn''t after my money, i''d go for it!" from albany, n.y.: "have
    i ever cheated? yes. am i sorry? no! we''ve been married for 22 years. i''m 48,
    and ''miss untouchable'' is 47, and she hasn''t had her nightgown off in 10 years.
    she announced, ''we have our family now. i''ve done my duty, so don''t bother
    me''!" here''s an upper: "my husband and i just celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary,
    and if our sex life was any better, we couldn''t handle it. i was 19 and he was
    22 when we married. we were both virgins. i swear sex is the fountain of youth.
    my mother told me that the way to a man''s heart was through his stomach, but
    i think i found a shortcut." tomorrow: more quotes from the survey.'

  body: 'dear readers: in my fidelity survey that brought over 210,000 responses,
    i was both astonished and reassured to learn that the marriage vow-to forsake
    all others-is still honored by 85 percent of the females and 74 percent of the
    males who responded. fred case, a seattle times reporter, called the other day,
    and in a charming british accent asked: "does your survey bear out what lord byron
    wrote in ''don juan'': ''there''s more adultery where the climate''s sultry''?"
    i told fred that we were not tabulating the findings regionally, so his guess
    was as good as mine. i did, however, observe that canadian behavior appeared to
    be no different than american, though the climate is somewhat sultrier in our
    southern states. many respondents aired their frustrations in order to justify
    their philandering: "occasional affairs with call girls keeps me sane," confided
    an investment broker on his business stationery. "it''s the only way i can tolerate
    the emptiness of living with a woman who is unable to show any affection through
    physical intimacy." women, too, wrote to justify their infidelities. the most
    common complaint: "sex with my husband is so mechanical and unromantic. no caresses,
    no compliments, no love talk. he never talks to me. it''s so humiliating!" another
    unfulfilled wife wrote: "yes, i cheated on my husband. after nine years of marriage,
    i got bored and curious and wanted to see what else was out there. i had a real
    estate agent, an accountant, a jeweler, a commercial airline pilot, a construction
    worker and a magazine editor. the construction worker was the best and the editor
    was the worst. thank god this was long before aids." a denver wife wrote: "my
    husband doesn''t know how to make love, but he sure knows how to make money. i''d
    try to teach him a few things, but i''m afraid he''ll ask me where i learned it."
    the number of faithful older lovers was heartening. letter after letter described
    enduring, true-blue marriages from couples in their 60s, 70s and 80s: from st.
    paul, minn.: "we''re writing because we want to add to the number of couples who
    have never cheated. i''m 92 and my wife is 88. we''ve been married for 71 years,
    still have all our marbles and enjoy every aspect of married life, though we have
    slowed up some in recent years (arthritis)." a 60-year-old farmer from lexington,
    ky., wrote: "married 36 years, never cheated. no sex relations for eight years
    now. the wife says she''s through with that kind of stuff. if opportunity ever
    knocks, i''m afraid i''ll be too old and deaf to hear it." some men admit to cheating-but
    only occasionally. from philadelphia: "i''ve been married for 24 years and cheated
    twice. once when i went back to my hometown for my 10th high school reunion, then
    again when i went back for my 20th (same girl). now i''m looking forward to my
    25th reunion." i have enough material from this survey to write a book. and if
    i do, i will certainly include the following. some short takes: -"male, age 39,
    married 16 years. income $55,000 a year. cheated? yes. but only out of town."
    -"abby, please send me a list of females who have cheated in the tampa bay area.
    (i''m lonely but not necessarily desperate.)" -"female, married 66 years. i have
    never cheated on my husband. i am 83 and my husband is 89 and says he can''t remember."
    -"there are so many mismatched couples. when a man wants sex six times a week
    and his wife is satisfied with twice a month, that doesn''t mean there''s anything
    wrong with either one of them; they just have a lousy marriage. i have made a
    lot of women happy and i never broke up anybody''s home-and i never neglected
    my own wife, either. if there is a hall of fame for lovers, i should be in it.
    i have to go now; my wife wants me." -and finally: "i am a woman now 40, married
    21 years and have cheated more times than i can count, but i will never cheat
    again. why? because i fear god, damnation, pregnancy, herpes and aids. besides,
    i found jesus."'

    when "wendy" told of having been stung by a bee that had gotten into her soft
    drink can while she was golfing, you thanked her for the warning about this hazard.
    abby, are you sure the insect was a bee? i am very doubtful. at innumerable picnics,
    i have been harassed by yellow jackets. they were in my soft drink bottle, on
    my hamburger, buzzing around my head and stinging my ankles. occasionally other
    wasps have entered the game, but never have i seen a honeybee behave this way.
    honeybees will sting in defense of their hives, or to protect themselves if you
    grab them. but they do not invade soft drink cans or attack picnickers. the nasty-tempered
    yellow jacket, which is about the same size as a honeybee, is very often mistaken
    for the bee! it attacks without provocation and nests around golf courses, and
    gravitates toward food and beverages. it''s given the useful honeybee a bad reputation.
    many a hive of honeybees has been destroyed; many a beekeeper has been forced

    here''s another version of why second lieutenants were called "shavetails": when
    a soldier made the transition from enlisted man to officer, he had a surplus of
    plain-style shirts. officers'' shirts had epaulets-little strips of fabric on
    the shoulders. so rather than scrap the shirts he had, he took them to the tailor
    shop in the post exchange and had the tailor sew epaulets on the shoulders. and
    where did the tailor get the extra material to make the epaulets? he just "shaved"
    it off the tail of the shirt. hence every second lieutenant who was formerly an
    enlisted man was known as a "shavetail." grant t. edmonds, littleton, colo.'

    thanks for advising "carolina churchgoer" to tell her minister privately to please
    stop asking (in a loud tone): "where is your husband this morning?" that reminds
    me of a minister we once had. although my husband and i attended church services
    every sunday morning, our minister would say, "why don''t you two join our bible
    study group on thursday nights?" then he would say, "i never see you at sunday
    night services-you really should make an effort to attend." every time we missed
    a church picnic, supper, book review or guest lecturer, the minister always asked:
    "where were you?" in addition to every sunday morning service, we also attended
    easter and christmas services, and figured that was quite enough church for us.
    as paul harvey would say: "here''s the rest of the story." we finally changed
    churches, and now a nice young pastor greets us warmly, thanks us for coming,
    and never tries to lay a guilt trip on us for not attending church more often.

    recently you published a letter from a woman who said that while she was contemporary
    in her thinking and happily married, she was concerned about the fact that sex
    therapists recommend fantasizing to add spice to a long marriage suffering from
    creeping boredom-and yet, "somewhere in the bible it says that thinking lustful
    thoughts is as great a sin as actually committing the sin." she signed herself,
    "afraid to fantasize." abby, the point that some religions try to make about sexuality
    in marriage is not that it is fulfilled by perfect people who are lustless. rather,
    the point is that two fallible people with enough mutual forgiveness and humor
    can discover enough grace from god to be lovingly sexual with each other for a
    lifetime. certainly, fantasy as well as lust will be present, and, hopefully,
    be handled creatively for the oneness of the couple. instead of demanding an instant
    answer from matthew 5, i would encourage the lady to talk with her ordained minister
    about the spirit and the letter of scriptures'' moral injunction, and talk with
    her sex therapist as well as a marriage counselor. and she might even talk to
    her husband. rev. william e. swing, bishop, episcopal diocese of calif. problems?

    for almost 50 years. for many years my husband and i went to a movie once a week.
    during world war ii, we went to two movies a week. in recent years, we''ve attended
    only two-maybe three-movies a year. why don''t we go more often? because the language
    in most movies today is just plain vulgar! nudity i can take, but the foul language
    is disgusting. i''m no prude. i sometimes resort to swearing myself, but to sit
    for two hours and listen to nothing but "s---" and "f---" in every other sentence
    is not my idea of entertainment. i suppose because the young moviemakers use that
    kind of language in their everyday conversation, they think everybody else does.
    well, everybody else doesn''t! this is especially frustrating for us because we
    live within walking distance of a theater with 10 screens, and we can''t find

    four years ago, i made the most stupid mistake of my life. i was arrested for
    shoplifting from a k-mart department store. i appeared in court and was fined
    $200 on a misdemeanor charge. very few people know about this. since then, i''ve
    graduated from college in social work. i am presently unemployed, and social work
    jobs are hard to come by. but my situation makes it worse. i''m afraid to fill
    out a job application. when i see a question concerning "convictions," i leave
    it blank. the guilt i carry is so enormous, i have even considered suicide. my
    life is ruined. what can i do if i am unemployable? how i wish i would have thought
    out the devastating consequences before i committed such a stupid act. i''ve enrolled
    in a nursing program recently. i answered "no" on the application concerning convictions.
    i called my state licensing board and explained my situation. they advised me
    to inform the school, and answer "yes" to a couple of questions on the nursing
    board examinations. but they added it would not be cause for denying me a license.
    abby, i can''t bring myself to inform the school. i am not a bad person. in fact,
    most people would say that i am an outstanding young woman. (i have many awards
    to prove it.) yet i feel worthless and depressed. how can i get out of this nightmare?

    i am a freshman in high school. coming up in june is our freshman frolic, a formal
    dance for ninth-graders. our principal just announced that she is banning the
    use of limousines to and from the frolic. she has also banned the rental of tuxedos
    and full-length gowns. this has been allowed in all previous years. the majority
    of our class does not believe that this is a fair decision. we feel that if the
    students'' parents are willing to foot the bill for gown, tuxedo and limo, they
    should have the right to do so. we would rather not be driven by our parents,
    and we want to wear whatever we consider formal and nice. our principal has received
    calls for and against her decision. she explained that by allowing limousines,
    gowns and tuxedos, the students who can''t afford them will stay home because
    they''ll be embarrassed to arrive in an ordinary car and not dressed as fancy
    as others. she also says that we will have the chance to do these expensive things
    in the upper grades. we feel that since it has been allowed before, and our parents
    are willing to pay for it, we should be entitled to enjoy such privileges. how
    do you feel about this? flustered freshman, west newbury, mass.'

    well, i thought i''d heard everything until i went to a dentist in a new town
    and needed to have a tooth pulled. would you believe that dentist doesn''t pull
    teeth? he sent me to an oral surgeon. i found it hard to believe that a dentist
    couldn''t-or wouldn''t-pull a tooth, so i asked the receptionist at the oral surgeon''s
    office why my dentist wouldn''t pull my tooth. she said my dentist wanted to make
    sure it was extracted correctly, as if there was an incorrect way to pull a tooth.
    when i went in to see the oral surgeon, he told me that my dentist and he were
    lifelong friends. then he assured me that my dentist was a very fine dentist.
    (if he was such a fine dentist, how come he doesn''t know how to pull a tooth
    correctly?) it cost me a lot more to have the tooth pulled by an oral surgeon
    than if a dentist had done the job. abby, i find it hard to trust a dentist who
    can''t do a basic procedure like pulling a tooth, but sends me to a lifelong buddy
    down the road who just happens to be an oral surgeon. i personally think they

    one of the toughest tasks a church faces is choosing a good minister. a member
    of an official board undergoing this painful process finally lost patience. he''d
    watched the pastoral relations committee reject applicant after applicant for
    some fault, alleged or otherwise. it was time for a bit of soul-searching on the
    part of the committee. so he stood up and read a letter purporting to be from
    another applicant. "gentlemen: understanding your pulpit is vacant, i should like
    to apply for the position. i have many qualifications. i''ve been a preacher with
    much success and also some success as a writer. some say i''m a good organizer.
    i''ve been a leader most places i''ve been. "i''m over 50 years of age. i have
    never preached in one place for more than three years. in some places i have left
    town after my work caused riots and disturbances. i must admit i have been in
    jail three or four times, but not because of any real wrongdoing. "my health is
    not too good, though i still get a great deal done. the churches i have preached
    in have been small, though located in several large cities. "i''ve not gotten
    along well with religious leaders in towns where i have preached. in fact, some
    have threatened me and even attacked me physically. i am not too good at keeping
    records. i have been known to forget whom i have baptized. "however, if you can
    use me, i shall do my best for you." the board member looked over the committee.
    "well, what do you think? shall we call him?" the good church folks were aghast.
    call an unhealthy, trouble-making, absent-minded ex-jailbird? was the board member
    crazy? who signed the application? who had such colossal nerve? the board member
    eyed them all keenly before he answered. "it''s signed, ''the apostle paul."''

    my oldest son is preparing for his bar mitzvah, and i have started to make up

    i haven''t seen in many years- especially those who live out of town-i feel as

    living from paycheck to paycheck. two of my aunts have decided it''s time that

    would not need a thing! my aunts feel that people who live alone need the same
    basic items as those who are about to be married, and it''s high time i was on

    i have a message for "angry," who feels that her husband is selfish for refusing
    to have a vasectomy. i was in the same situation after our second child was born.
    we had a boy and a girl and agreed that our family was complete, so i asked my
    husband to have a vasectomy. he agreed, but his heart wasn''t in it. the arrangements
    were made, and i prepped him for the operation the night before. when we arrived
    at the hospital, the nurse gave us reading material and consent forms to sign.
    we read about the surgery procedure, discomforts to be expected, the possible
    complications, follow-up visits, etc. ten minutes later, the nurse came in and
    said, "mr. smith, are you ready?" when my husband replied "yes," i noticed that
    his voice was pitched about two octaves higher than normal. at this point i realized
    that he was doing this just for me, so i said, "what do you say we go get some
    breakfast and forget this whole thing?" that did it! he bolted for the door, and
    with a look of undying gratitude in his eyes, kept saying, "thank you, thank you"
    over and over. he didn''t even care when he was itching to death while his hair
    grew back in! shortly after, i had a tubal ligation. there was no pain, no swelling,
    no loss of work, and best yet, no weekly sperm checks. i would have advised "angry"
    to have a tubal ligation, and leave the family jewels alone. a vasectomy is not

    to have. where is it written that one must mourn alone? it took me a long time

    additional material published apr. 2, 1988: corrections and clarifications. -
    in a story that appeared in some editions of friday''s chicagoland/du page section,
    state rep. thomas j. mccracken jr. (r., downers grove) was identified only by
    his last name. the tribune regrets the errors. northern illinois university officials,
    in a statement they hope to make with a straight face friday, are proposing drastic
    measures to save money in what is expected to be another tight year for state
    universities. included in the de kalb school''s cost-cutting plan: - sending faculty
    to academic conferences but providing no return tickets. - replacing intercollegiate
    football with intramural cribbage. - requiring education faculty to reduce jargon
    by two-thirds. - allowing political scientists to straddle only one position at
    a time. if those sound extreme, then consider a proposal to teach history through
    the dark ages and cancel the enlightenment, and another to close the counseling
    center and refer students to dear abby. it''s april fool''s day, and this year
    the niu public relations office is having its annual giggle at the expense of
    the illinois general assembly. in aprils past, niu has offered the press exclusive
    photos of the loch ness monster emerging from the niu lagoon and an interview
    with a "weather activist" predicting a weather shortage after a particularly bitter
    winter. niu officials have, in all seriousness, joined higher education leaders
    across the state in lobbying lawmakers to raise the state''s income tax to provide
    more money for public universities and community colleges, which were forced to
    cut programs after the legislature rejected a tax increase last summer. much of
    the push has come in the form of somber rhetoric and dire predictions aimed at
    grabbing headlines or a sound bite on the six o''clock news. but the press release
    hoax might work just as well to persuade lawmakers who don''t seem to be supporting
    an increase. is there a lawmaker cruel enough to limit music majors to the use
    of one octave and half-notes? and who could maintain an anti-tax stand while law
    students receive credit for watching "divorce court" on television? surely, even
    the most penny-pinching politician wouldn''t force art majors to use only one
    color, or try to save astronomy and biology lab costs by using microscopes and
    telescopes in two directions. "the whole idea was you sort of penetrate the message
    on a different level," said bob woggon, director of public information and principal
    wag. "once a year we try to restore our sanity so we are able to go on for the
    next year. mccracken said he "can''t respond" to pleas for a tax increase because
    no proposal has been submitted to the general assembly, but he chuckled at niu''s
    poke at lawmakers. "obviously, it''s a very serious subject," he said, but in
    springfield "you''ve got to have a sense of humor to survive." he said the plan
    to switch from football to cribbage might be adopted by other state universities,
    including the university of illinois, a member of the big 10 conference, whose
    midwestern schools usually are thrashed by west coast pac 10 teams in the rose
    bowl. "but the big 10 still couldn''t beat the pac 10 in a cribbage tournament,"
    he said.'

    you were wrong in your reply to "angry," who wanted her husband to have a vasectomy.
    you suggested that she might change her mind about having more children. abby,
    the world is already so overpopulated that no family should have more than two
    children. we hope it will never be necessary to do in this country what the chinese
    have done-limit families, by law, to only one child. you may be one of those people
    who feel people should have as many children as they can afford to feed, but,
    abby, we are running out of space for people to live and we are depleting our
    natural resources. you should have told that lady to sleep in separate beds until
    her husband comes to his senses (if he has any). what if he has a scar half an
    inch long? who''s going to see it? as for discomfort for one or two days, that''s

    our niece is being married in june. she is the daughter of my husband''s sister.
    we do not see this family very often, even though they live less than 50 miles
    from us. yesterday we received a beautifully engraved invitation to this niece''s
    wedding, but there was no rsvp or dinner card enclosed, so i phoned my sister-
    in-law (the bride''s mother) to thank her and inform her of the omission. she
    said, "my daughter just wanted you to see the invitation-you are not actually
    invited to the wedding." i couldn''t believe my ears. although we do not have
    the kind of money that they have and live on a small farm, we are not the kind
    of relatives one would be ashamed of. my husband felt hurt but thinks we ought
    to send some kind of wedding gift. what are your thoughts? also hurt in kansas'

    you are all wet about the man who looks at a picture and says, "brothers and sisters

    i just read the letter from "my turn in minnesota." his parents disowned him six
    years ago when he was 19. (he got his 20-year-old girlfriend pregnant, and when
    he told his folks, they put his belongings on the front lawn and said, "you are
    no longer our son, and you are no longer welcome in our home!") the son had a
    job and never asked for money-only their love and moral support. he married the
    girl, and did very well for himself; then he received a letter from his father
    saying his company had gone bankrupt and he needed $500 a month "for a while"!
    i couldn''t believe your answer, abby! you actually advised him to meet with his
    parents and discuss how he could help them. this is how i would have answered
    their letter: "dear mr. and mrs. so-and-so: six years ago when i needed your love
    and support, you threw me out of the house and told me that i was no longer your
    son. "so, if i am not your son, how can you be my parents? i know families should

    some time ago you had a letter from "debating in n.j.," describing her hurt and
    disappointment from not hearing from close friends following her serious accident.
    i have recently had a similar experience. my daughter just had an illegitimate
    baby, and i left home to be with her and lend my support. on my return home, i
    told my friends, and now the fact is generally known-as it should be. what dismays
    me is that almost everyone i know has dropped the subject, and it is never mentioned.
    in my heart, i know they are puzzled about what to say, but the word from here
    is to say something-even if you aren''t sure of what to say. fumbling for the
    right words is infinitely better than not saying anything at all. this applies
    for a new divorce, a new widow (widower), a parent whose child has gone to jail-any
    number of embarrassing incidents when you don''t know exactly what to say. here''s
    a sample: "i know carolyn has a new baby. i hope she''s managing. does she need
    anything?" "you''ve had a great loss. i''m thinking of you." "now that you are
    single again, i will call each week to see how you are. i care." "we know john
    is in prison. is he doing all right? what word have you had?" if any of the above
    is too difficult, send a card. you can surely find one that will express your
    feelings perfectly. thank you, abby, for letting me say this. people lover'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    as the tourist season approaches, may i offer a few travel tips to our american
    friends who plan to vacation in canada? 1. all purchases in canada (this includes
    hotel, food, souvenirs, etc.) are in canadian funds! it can be very trying to
    hear (at least 10 times a day): "is this in american money?" when in italy, use
    lire; in japan, use yen; in the states, use american; and in canada, use canadian.
    2. if you cannot get to an exchange house or bank to change money to canadian
    funds, most places will take your american money and convert it to canadian for
    you upon purchase. only a bank or some such institution can legally exchange your
    money without purchase. this goes for exchanging your canadian money back to american
    before you go home. please, do not get mad at the waitress, desk clerk or cashier
    if they cannot do it for you. you can still convert it back to american when you
    get back home, right? 3. do not say, "give me that in ''real'' money. none of
    that ''funny money'' (or monopoly money), now!" it is true, our money is worth
    "less" than the american counterpart, but this is to your advantage. a few final
    notes: remember to buckle your seat belt in british columbia. this is the law!
    the speed limit is as follows: country, 50 mph; city, 30 mph. declare any weapons
    in your car or baggage at the border. retrieve them later. try to smuggle them
    in, and, if caught (a lot are), you will lose your weapons permanently and face
    a very stiff fine. i know this is a long letter, abby, but i hope that it will
    help some americans to enjoy their trip to canada a little bit more. happy holidays,
    eh? a.l.k., victoria, b.c.'

    can you stomach another letter about cooking fresh fish? after 60-plus years in
    the seafood business, we know that fish smells "fishy" when it cooks usually because
    it isn''t fresh. overcooked fish will also have that odor. the practice of thawing
    out frozen fish and trying to pass it off as fresh fish has given many a cook
    a bad experience. we recommend buying fresh fish only from a reliable fishmonger,
    or buying only top-quality frozen fish. few home refrigerators are cold enough
    to store fish properly, so the fish should be eaten the day of purchase. the lady
    who complained about the cooking odors should present her neighbor with a pound
    of really fresh fish, accompanied by a recipe with the proper cooking time. we
    recommend 10 minutes per inch of thickness at medium- high heat. that means a
    fillet that is 3/4 inch thick should be cooked for only 7 or 8 minutes. adding
    a little wine, or water and lemon juice, to the cooking pan will prevent odors
    as well. who knows, the lady who complained could end up staying for dinner! nancy

    at last! i''ve found it! i''ve been searching through boxes of papers-i knew i
    had it somewhere. several years ago i clipped the enclosed letter from your column
    and copied it for a "handout" to a class of teenagers. tell me, would you dare
    print such a letter today, or have your moral values changed as have those of
    the popular majority? today, more than ever, this is the kind of counsel that
    should be preached from the housetops-and everywhere else. do you still consider
    illicit sex an immoral act? i pray you do. think of the problems it causes, to
    name a few: unwanted pregnancies, unwed mothers, uncared-for children, poorly
    trained parents, aborted careers, welfare stigma- and now we have the horrible
    threat of aids. our young people need to be taught that abstinence until marriage,
    regardless of the message from movies, tv and society, is the only way to "prove
    your love." mrs. lionel j. chambers, north ogden, utah here''s the letter: what
    is real love? girls need to "prove their love" through illicit sex relations like
    a moose needs a hatrack. why not "prove your love" by sticking your head in the
    oven and turning on the gas? and how about playing leapfrog in the traffic? it''s
    about as safe. clear the cobwebs out of your head. any fellow who asks you to
    "prove your love" is trying to take you for the biggest, most gullible fool who
    ever walked. that "proving" bit is one of the rottenest lines ever invented. does
    he love you? it doesn''t sound like it. someone who loves you wants whatever is
    best for you. but now figure it out. he wants you to: commit an immoral act .
    . . surrender your virtue . . . throw away your self-respect . . . risk the loss
    of your precious reputation . . . and risk getting into trouble. does that sound
    as though he wants what''s best for you? that is the biggest laugh of the century.
    he wants what''s best for him; he wants a thrill he can brag about at your expense.
    love? who''s kidding whom? a guy who loves a girl would sooner cut off his right
    arm than hurt her. in my opinion, this self-serving so-and-so has proved that
    he doesn''t love you. the predictable aftermath of "proof" of this kind always
    finds don juan tiring of his sport. that''s when he drops you, picks up his line
    and goes casting elsewhere for bigger and equally foolish fish. if he loves you,
    let him prove his love-at the altar.'

    your recent column piece on the top 10 problems of 1940 compared to those of today
    really struck a nerve. when i was in high school, our biggest problems were similar
    to those in charles osteen''s letter-talking in the halls, chewing gum, etc. today''s
    teens have to cope with drug abuse, pregnancy, rape, robbery, etc. there are seldom
    simple solutions to pervasive problems, but i have one i''d sure like to see tried.
    it is for parents to once again teach their children the time-tested values of
    respect for the law, their teachers, their elders, other people''s rights and,
    most of all, for themselves as the future of this country. it is painfully obvious
    to me that many of today''s youngsters are almost totally lacking in moral and
    ethical guidance; hence it is not surprising that they are in such deep trouble
    so often. right here in my own neighborhood we are daily faced with school children
    who run amok, sass their elders, trespass on private property, trash the streets-all
    with their parents'' approval, even encouragement. one father even had the gall
    to tell me that his kids had a "right" to play in the street in front of my home
    and if i didn''t like it, i could move! perhaps it''s time once again for your

    this concerns "haunted," the gentleman who was "groped" under the blanket on an
    overnight flight by a precocious 10-year-old girl. you told him he should have
    told one of the adult members of the girl''s family traveling with her that the
    child had a problem and needed counseling. sure, the child had a problem and needed
    counseling, but where do you think she learned such behavior? obviously someone
    close to her had sexually abused her. such seductive behavior is common in incest
    victims. had that man followed your advice, the girl would have denied it and
    accused the man of touching her. it would be her word against his-and children
    always win in such cases! i would have advised the man to find another seat, say
    nothing to anybody, and let it go at that. i speak from experience, having served
    18 months in prison for child molestation. an 8-year-old girl lied. now i never
    allow children in my house unless another adult is present, and i never allow
    a child to get within touching distance. my name and address are for your eyes

    your reply to "haunted" touched a nerve. while well- intended, it would have landed
    him in jail immediately. had i been the gentleman in question, i would have gone
    immediately to my private attorney, put the whole incident down in affidavit form,
    had my attorney file an anonymous "friend of the court" petition on that child''s

    my fifth high school reunion is coming up soon and i want very much to go, but

    married a year later. we now live in a small town 600 miles from my hometown.
    bob grew up here, where the boys and girls never mixed much, and he is outrageously
    jealous if i as much as smile at another man. we have had incidents already where
    he had no reason to be jealous, but he has been. i know that if i were to hug
    a male classmate, or even touch him, bob would make a scene. (he could not understand
    our graduation pictures-with boys and girls holding hands in a semicircle. "touching"
    to him is off- limits.) we have a good marriage, but i must be on my guard constantly
    so bob won''t get the wrong idea. he won''t let me go to the reunion without him,
    but the first "do you remember?" is sure to send him into a jealous rage that
    could even end in divorce! he is no. 1 in my life, but how can i make him understand

    my hat is off to you for the response you gave that woman who asked for a tactful
    way to tell her two large sisters, whom she wanted to be her bridesmaids, to lose
    weight before the wedding (supposedly because of difficulties in finding dresses
    to fit them). you said there was no tactful way. you were right-and then you reminded
    her that beauty comes in all sizes. of course, larger dresses could have been
    made without too much difficulty. i was recently one of 10 bridesmaids, some of
    whom (myself included) weighed more than 300 pounds. we all had beautiful matching
    gowns made either by the bridesmaid herself or a seamstress, and if i may say
    so, i think we all looked wonderful. not only does beauty come in all sizes-so
    does love and romance. the bride weighed over 300 pounds, too! a big fan in butler,

    a short time ago you suggested that people take old, unused clothing to the goodwill

    the types of things they really need are formal wear, men''s suits, uniforms,
    boots and hats. also costume jewelry, and accessories such as parasols, fans,
    feather boas, lace and other types of trim, and any old apparel in good condition
    that dates back 40 years or more. those lonely people who write to you might also
    consider their community theaters when donating their talents. there are hundreds
    of jobs that need to be done other than acting, and never enough hands at most
    theaters to do them. any retired carpenters? painters? artists? most people associated
    with the theater are relaxed, friendly, congenial and great fun. margaret fox,

    i''d like to comment on the letter from a young woman who was whining because
    her parents believed that since she was living in their house, she should follow

    how about getting a job? when i was 15, i worked to pay for my extras. my parents
    took care of my "needs"-but i took care of my "wants." when i was 18, i moved
    out of their house to live closer to the university i attended. i paid all of
    my tuition, rent, books, living expenses, bills, car, you name it. i worked full-time,
    went to school full-time, lived on my own and was able to graduate with a 3.5
    gpa. i''ve added up my expenses over that five-year period, and they came to more
    than $25,000. my parents are proud of me, and i''m proud of me. i could have stayed
    out all night if i wanted to-if i wanted to fall asleep in the class i was paying
    my own money to attend. i became responsible out of necessity, and it paid off.

    suit or a bikini? who cares? of far greater importance is the fact that it''s
    impossible to watch a professional baseball game without seeing at least one (and
    usually several) players with a huge wad of chewing tobacco in their mouths. not
    only do they look ridiculous with their faces distorted by the sheer volume of
    the stuff, the act of chewing and spitting is revolting to watch, and it sets

    i have the most unusual problem anyone can imagine. "kenneth" and i have been
    married for 62 years-until now, very happily. when i was in my teens, it was a
    fad to keep a diary, so i kept one. my husband came across my diary and read it!
    i had a few dates with a boy when i was 18. i wrote about going to three dances
    with him-also a picnic. then i stopped seeing him because i met kenneth. we fell
    in love, and a year later we were married. now, 62 years later, kenneth wants
    to know "everything" about this fellow, and, abby, for the life of me i can''t
    remember a thing about him-what he looked like, how i met him or anything else.
    i swear he didn''t mean a thing to me. kenneth is making my life miserable. can
    you suggest anything that may help me remember this fellow? kenneth said for me
    to write to you. thanks a million. wounded wife in ohio'

    two years ago, i advised my (then) 15-year-old grandson that for every dollar
    he put into his savings account, i would match it toward his purchase of a car.
    so far he has put very little into the account, but now he is asking if i will
    match his funds for the purchase of a motorcycle, as the price of a car is beyond
    his finances. the boy is bright, intelligent and irresponsible. he could have
    worked and saved enough money (with my matching funds) to have purchased a good
    secondhand car by now, but he is primarily interested in sports, surfing and the
    female gender. his father (my son) does not want him to have a motorcycle, and
    i am reluctant to go against my son''s wishes. what shall i do? alienate my son
    or my grandson? george in san francisco'

  body: 'dear readers: did you know that more accidents occur in the home than on
    highways? the u.s. public health service estimates that 40 percent to 50 percent
    of all falls at home can be prevented with some practical changes in the home.
    consider: all rooms: in doorways, raised thresholds should be removed or covered
    with carpet. keep electrical cords out of the way. get rid of frayed rugs and
    avoid throw rugs. fasten area carpets to the floor with tape or tacks. repair
    any furniture that is unsteady. stairways: they are common locations for falls.
    be sure stairways are well-lighted. install secure handrails. if you have a vision
    problem, bright tape applied to the first and last steps can help. bedrooms: put
    a light switch at the door so no one has to cross a dark room to turn on a light.
    avoid placement of furniture that will make it hazardous. beds and chairs need
    to be of proper height: when the occupant is sitting, feet should touch the floor,
    with knees comfortably bent. bathrooms: install safety rails at the tub and grab-handles
    by the toilet. (never use towel bars as grab-handles.) put a non-skid mat near
    both places. shower chairs and bath benches minimize risks of falling. remember:
    a mishap in the shower can lead to a burn injury if the water mixer level is accidentally
    turned in an effort to prevent the fall. kitchen: are your cabinets hard to reach?
    use extension tongs or, if necessary, a small stepladder. never stand on a chair
    to reach a shelf. (better yet, "retire" that top shelf.) wipe up spills immediately.
    use non-skid floor wax. stove controls (especially for gas ranges) should be clearly
    visible and in good working order. the above information is from the mayo clinic
    health letter. i have found a wealth of practical information in this monthly
    newsletter. if you can afford the $24 a year, write to editor scott d. olson,
    mayo clinic, rochester, minn. 55905, and tell him dear abby sent you. it will

    perhaps the person who is constantly told to smile should read what dale carnegie
    had to say in his book, "how to win friends and influence people": the value of
    a smile it costs nothing, but creates much; it enriches those who receive, without
    impoverishing those who give; it happens in a flash, and the memory of it sometimes
    lasts forever; none are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor
    but are richer for its benefits. it creates happiness in the home, fosters good
    will in a business, and is the countersign of friends. it is rest to the weary,
    daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and nature''s best antidote
    for trouble. yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or stolen, for it is of
    no earthly good to anybody until it is given away. nobody needs to smile so much
    as those who have none left to give. smile, smile, smile. marion t. phillips,

    my husband was scared and reluctant to go through surgery, but because he loves
    me, he had a vasectomy. imagine what a shock it was to find out a few weeks ago
    that i am going to have another baby in september! my doctor said i am the third

    back in 1960, "tom" and i were engaged. he needed money to finish college, so
    i gave him $2,000. (i was a nurse living at home at the time.) after tom graduated,
    we broke up, by mutual agreement. he said he''d repay the money when he could
    afford it. ten years later, he sent me a money order for $1,000, saying he had

    i wonder if secondhand tobacco smoke affects animals? if it''s hazardous to the
    health of humans, it''s probably bad for animals, too. i doubt if anything can
    be done about this legally, but morally people should consider how secondhand
    smoke can affect the lifespan of their pets. i would be sad to learn that my smoking
    caused the early death of my dog, and i''m sure other people feel the same. robert

    my mother-in-law, who lives in another state, sends a $50 check to each of us
    on our birthdays-this includes our three adult children. last january, "mom" sent
    our son, todd, a check for $16 made out to the telephone company! todd realized
    that his check had gone to the telephone company by mistake, so he returned the
    one he received to grandma. after three weeks todd heard nothing from grandma,
    but my husband phoned her on another matter, and in the course of the conversation
    he asked if the telephone company had ever returned the $50 check she sent them
    by mistake. she said, "no. when i called to tell them about the error, they said
    they had already endorsed my check and deposited it as ''credit'' for future telephone
    service"! my husband didn''t ask his mother if she intended to send todd another
    birthday check because he assumed that she would. well, it''s been five months,
    and she hasn''t done so. first, i''m surprised that the telephone company could
    endorse and deposit a check that was not made out to them. also, i feel sorry
    that todd received no birthday check from grandma this year. should i let the
    matter drop? or when i get my birthday check from grandma in june, should i give
    it to todd and tell grandma what i''ve done? sorry for todd'

    some of her friends have told her that men are intimidated by beautiful women,

    my husband and i often travel by car around the country. on our last trip, as
    on previous ones, we ran into people at rest areas asking for money. the first
    person was trying to get to a family reunion in st. george, utah, in january because
    he couldn''t get home for christmas. he offered to sell us anything he had, or
    return our money. (he had used up his money on car repairs.) not wanting to give
    out our address, we just gave him the money. the second one was about two hours
    west of phoenix. a woman and her husband were trying to get to phoenix. they had
    run out of gas and were broke. she was in her 50s-she stood by the restroom door
    asking for money. i gave her $5 and asked how much she had collected. she said
    $9. i said, "well, that should buy enough gas to get you to phoenix"-then suggested
    she get in touch with travelers aid. she continued to ask others for help. in
    a third instance, we were asked for money for gas and food. this time there was
    a young child and a couple of ragtag-looking adults. the car hood was up, the
    man was sitting on the curb and the woman was sitting in the car. this time we
    did not make a donation. my problem: if i don''t help out, my conscience bothers

    my husband (i''ll call him george) is 52. he learned four years ago after his
    "father" died that he had been adopted when he was 3 years old. it was a shock
    to us, and it took us several years to decide whether we wanted to find his biological
    parents. curiosity about his "roots" won out, and we finally found his family
    in illinois. george was the youngest of 11 siblings who had been placed in an
    orphanage, but he was the only one who was legally adopted. the other 10 grew
    up in the orphanage. they all said they had been looking for george all these
    years, as he was the "baby" of the family. none of his siblings have had any education
    or opportunities. my husband''s adoptive parents were upper-middle-class people
    who gave george a wonderful life, college education, etc. our problem: after a
    huge family reunion, his relatives have inundated us with love letters, and there
    are so many of them we don''t know what to do. we are satisfied to know my husband''s
    roots now, but our lives have taken different paths; we don''t want an intimate
    involvement with them. we attended a reunion with hundreds of shirttail relatives.
    we were overwhelmed, and are now sorry we pursued this. i have subtly indicated

    family-children, grandchildren, etc., but the letters keep coming, inviting us
    to weddings, graduations, christenings, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. what should

    his financial obligations, he was kind, gentle, supportive and just strict enough
    for my own good. he still is. my mother continues to bad-mouth him, which leaves
    me feeling angry and sad. why am i writing you all this, abby? because i want

    yours was a great response when you advised the son to talk to his father who
    had disowned him for getting his girlfriend pregnant-then the father asked his
    son for $500 a month for "a while" when his business failed. the father had probably
    done much soul-searching and had to swallow his piety and pride in order to ask
    his son for help. the bible eulogizes the father who took back the prodigal son.
    in the same way, a son could take back a prodigal father. virden seybold, baltimore

    a woman wrote in with a serious concern about her boss''s computer addiction,
    and you pointed out how useful computers are and brushed aside her complaint.
    one of the most destructive forces in the workplace today is addictive computer
    hobbying. computers are essential tools in the workplace, but much time and money
    are wasted when "working" with the computer becomes an end in itself. the reason
    that computer hobbying is so dangerous is that it is difficult to distinguish
    from real work. if i spent 80 percent of my time at work carving decoys or playing
    cards, i would be fired. however, i can spend 80 percent of my time on our computer
    just for the sheer joy of it and be highly valued, even if i never produce anything
    really worthwhile. the boss of the woman who wrote to you has discovered that
    "working" on the computer is more fun than any other part of his job (or life?).
    he will not simply computerize the operation and back off. he will continue to
    spend all his time reading about computers, talking about computers, studying
    and buying new hardware and software, programming, reprogramming, running off
    unnecessary memos and statistics, and visiting other people''s computers. when
    you give a 4-year-old a hammer, suddenly a lot of things need hammering. when

    first, but when he saw libby, he could not deny that he was her father. they got
    to know each other, and libby grew to love him very much. steve said he wanted
    to make up for lost time and pay for libby''s college education, and wanted her
    to have his name, so he asked for her birth certificate, adoption papers, etc.,
    which we gladly gave him. after libby enrolled in college, they sent steve a bill
    for tuition. he called the college, denied being her father and refused to pay
    it! libby was heartbroken-not because of the money, but because he had built her
    hopes up, then rejected her. steve said his wife was jealous and gave him an ultimatum-and
    he had to choose his wife. i have wanted to write to him and his wife and tell

    another national secretaries day has come and gone, and i have never been able
    to figure out why we need a special day to "honor" us for doing what we are being
    paid to do. i have been the secretary for the same man for 22 years. i love my
    job or i wouldn''t have stayed here this long. i know i''m competent or i wouldn''t
    have kept this job and received the raises and bonuses i have over the years.
    abby, may i give the bosses out there a word of advice? forget "secretaries day."
    the best investment you can make is to say "thank you" to your secretary for a
    job well-done. and to say "thank you very much" for exceptional performance. appreciated

    i am truly in love with a man who is in training to be a police officer. we''ve
    gone together for three years and i am ready for marriage, but "john" says he
    doesn''t want to get married-ever. he tells me he loves me, but because of the
    risks involved in his job, he doesn''t want to bring sorrow to a wife and family
    in case something happens to him in the line of duty. i''ve tried to tell him
    that if anything happened to him, it would still cause the same amount of sorrow
    whether we were married or not. i try to reason with him, but he refuses to discuss
    the subject, and gets upset every time i bring it up. i want to get married, have
    a family and spend the rest of my life with john, but none of this seems to matter
    to him. he is even against the idea of living together! abby, the thought of not
    being able to marry the man i love is very depressing. different friends are giving
    me advice. one says, "give him a scare by making him think there is somebody else
    in the picture and if he doesn''t marry you, he could lose you." another friend
    says, "don''t give up-hang in there and eventually john will change his mind."
    another friend has advised me to forget him. what do you say, abby? loves john'

    please offer suggestions to this problem. there are many ex- spouses in similar
    situations who could benefit from your advice. when a divorced person has remarried,
    should that person and his former spouse continue to phone each other? (i am told
    it''s about the kids, but the "kids" are in their 20s and 30s.) is it considered
    ethical and proper for a remarried person to visit the ex-spouse alone in that
    person''s house? i always believed it was common courtesy, out of respect to the
    present spouse, never to meet alone with the ex-spouse. am i wrong? wondering

    i am a busy ophthalmologist whose time is spent in treatment and eye surgery.
    i do not sell contact lenses. in fact, i forbid my patients to wear permanent-wear
    contact lenses. the main group desiring permanent-wear contact lenses are myopic
    (nearsighted) people who want to put something in, and wear it all day and all
    night. it works most of the time, but there are enough devastating consequences
    of these permanent-wear contact lenses so that i personally refuse to authorize
    them for my patients. if a patient asks for extended-wear contacts, i say no.
    and if i get an argument, i simply ask, "would you wear your shorts or panties
    for 30 to 50 days?" the answer is, "no, never!" i then explain that contact lenses
    collect moisture, mucus, sugar and other proteins from the tear fluid that will
    grow bacteria. the eye is a warm, moist place where all types of severe parasitic
    diseases can flourish. as far as i am concerned, the best contact lens by far
    is a soft lens that is placed into a heat sterilizer after each wearing. every
    day the wearer starts with a clean lens, which cannot grow enough bacteria or
    fungus in 24 hours to harm the eye. as a physician, i feel responsible for my
    patients'' care, and i think the legal system would probably feel that i bear
    some responsibility were i to prescribe permanent-wear lenses that damaged my
    patients'' eyes. i simply don''t want my patients to take the risk, although the
    major manufacturers would have you believe there is none. john wm. dickerson,

    this is not a terribly serious problem, but i would like an opinion from you,
    and maybe some of your readers would like to comment. several of my friends have
    the "call-waiting" service on their telephones. (i have not.) recently, my friend
    "joyce" (not her real name) called me. all she said was, "hello. how are you?"
    then, before i could even answer her, i heard her "call waiting" signal beep.
    she immediately said, "oh, somebody is trying to get me-i''ll call you right back."
    then she hung up on me. about 15 minutes later when joyce called back, i told
    her i thought she was extremely rude to have cut me off and taken the call from
    the other party. i said, "since you called me, you could have put me on ''hold''
    for two seconds while you told the other party you were talking to someone and
    would get back to him." i also told her she made me feel like i was second choice-that
    she was hoping someone more interesting was on the other line. to my surprise,
    joyce wasn''t angry with me for telling her off. she agreed with me and apologized.
    what are your thoughts on this, abby? second choice'

    i have a problem i hope you can help me with. i am a female college student and
    share a two-bedroom apartment near the college with another girl. when i moved
    in (september ''87), "nina" asked if i minded if her boyfriend, "greg," spent
    the night here. i said it would be ok-not realizing that greg would keep bringing
    more and more of his clothes over, until everything he owns is in this apartment!
    he''s supposed to be living with an "uncle," but that is just a cover-up for nina''s
    parents. if they knew greg was living with nina, they would cut off her money
    supply. (they pay her rent and all bills.) greg''s parents know about his living
    arrangement, but they don''t care. i feel that living together before you are
    married is wrong, and i am very uncomfortable with this situation. also, i feel
    that i am being taken advantage of because greg has never paid a dime for rent,
    gas, electricity, telephone-nothing. those bills are higher because greg takes
    showers, uses electricity, etc. nina and i want to lease this apartment next year
    because it''s cheap and near school, but i don''t want greg living here. i like
    nina. how can i tell her without losing her as a friend? three''s a crowd'

    the letter written by "perplexed," who received an oil painting as a wedding gift
    from a co-worker, could have been written by me some 20 years ago. when i moved
    into a new home, a friend presented me with a painting as a housewarming gift
    and said he hoped i would enjoy it. like "perplexed," i did not know what to do
    with it as it was "not to my liking." it sat on the floor, leaning against the
    wall in my living room for weeks. i would look at it daily and ponder its fate.
    then i remembered what my parents (rest their souls) said to me as i was growing
    up: "accept with graciousness that which is presented to you, be it a reward or
    a gift, being mindful of the feelings of the giver." today that painting hangs
    with pride in my living room, surrounded by some other paintings purchased over
    the years that have less meaning to me than the gift which was given. the "artist"?
    you should see the grin on his face when he comes to visit! there is no price
    on that painting, but i treasure it more than the others. tell "perplexed" that
    there are many things in life that are "not to our liking," but we can make a
    difference in someone else''s life by showing a bit of compassion. if they don''t
    know what to do with their painting, send it to me and i''ll find a place for
    it. thank you, dear lady, and god bless. grant masters, clearwater, fla.'

    the letter about the cremated remains brought back a funny memory. i had only
    one sister, whom i loved very much. we shared a lot of laughs. she was living
    in ohio when she died. i was in missouri. she was to be buried in the family plot
    in arkansas after cremation. the remains were sent to my house by mistake. i was
    canning tomatoes when the mailman arrived. my 5-year-old granddaughter ran out
    to the mailbox. she came in and said, "all there is is a box. can i open it?"
    she took it out on the back porch and in a minute she had it opened. she made
    a face and said, "grandma, why would anybody send you a whole box of gray sand?"
    i grabbed the box and said, "my god, that''s aunt grace!" i dropped the box and
    most of the "sand" on the ground! we gathered up as much of the "ashes" as we
    could and put them in a more sturdy box and sent it to arkansas. i am sure my
    sister would have had a good laugh had she witnessed that hilarious scene. i went
    out and bought a rose bush and planted it on the spot where the ashes had spilled.
    it really grew, and to this day, it is known as the aunt grace rose. why must

    in response to the party who wrote about the expression "i could care less," which
    i agree should be, "i couldn''t care less," i want to add that there are many
    words used in today''s conversation that are grossly misused. to mention a few:
    people say, "we kept going back and forth." it should be "forth and back." (we
    don''t say, "fro and to" -- we say, "to and fro.") when we back a car out of the
    garage, we go "back, then forth," but ordinarily, we go "forth and back," right?
    another common error is calling a water heater a "hot water heater." there is
    no such thing as a hot water heater-no one can heat hot water; hot water is already
    hot and cannot be heated. also, most people use the word "indefinitely" incorrectly.
    they say, "this item will last indefinitely," meaning that it will last forever.
    actually "indefinitely" means "unsure, uncertain an indefinite amount of time,"
    but it is used incorrectly to mean "forever." dick zonnefeld, artesia, calif.'

    ever sent $50 birthday checks to grandma. want to bet they don''t? yet, they feel
    that for as long as grandma lives, she should send her grandchildren money for
    their birthdays-and probably all the other gift-giving occasions as well. and
    what do they give grandma? doilies? a scarf? a box of cheap bath powder? and what
    if grandma decides that now that the grandchildren are adults, she''ll send them
    cards for their birthdays? would they sue her in small claims court for their
    $50 checks? or would they punish her by not visiting her anymore? abby, you would
    be shocked by the number of children and grandchildren who use these tactics to
    keep the presents coming. somehow they make it clear to the grandparents that
    they have to keep paying their dues if they expect to be loved, called and visited.
    i hope grandma reads your column and does what she should have done when the grandchildren
    turned 18: send them all birthday cards, and buy herself a nice treat instead.

    i can''t believe i am writing to ask you a question that most people would perceive
    as stupid, but here goes: should i offer to show a man who is in his late 20s
    the correct way to hold his knife and fork while cutting meat? he is married and
    a fairly successful salesman with good manners, but when he cuts meat, he makes
    a "fist" of his left hand and holds the fork straight up-like a 4-year-old child.

    on a recent tv program it was suggested that to keep love alive husbands should
    give their wives a 20-second kiss three times a day. it horrified me beyond words.
    most husbands cannot give their wives a "little kiss" without dragging them right
    to the sack! (that''s during the daytime- then comes the night!) for my part,
    they can forget their 20-second kisses three times a day. i have been divorced

    regarding your recent letter from the woman who didn''t attend her brother''s
    funeral because she wasn''t a hypocrite, i think your answer was way off. a funeral
    may well be for the living, but the living should apply first to the immediate
    family of the deceased, i.e. wife, husband, children-not brothers and sisters.
    my father had a brother who ignored him in his later years despite repeated attempts
    by my father to initiate contact. this hurt my father deeply, but there was no
    falling out-they just never spoke. then my uncle showed up at my father''s funeral.
    his presence upset my mother and me because we both knew how much one short visit
    from this brother would have meant to my father when he was alive. you''ll probably
    say that we shouldn''t carry a grudge, and maybe my uncle was trying to make up
    for what he had failed to do before, but nothing could make up for the hurt he
    caused my father in his final years. bitter? you''d better believe i''m bitter.

    recently i visited my ex-daughter-in-law and my granddaughter in another state,
    and this is how i was treated by my granddaughter (she treats her mother the same
    way): she kicked me, spat at me, knocked books and other items out of my hands,
    poked me in the abdomen and breasts with her bony elbows, stamped on my feet and
    screamed at me until she got her way. when she noticed that i was about to be
    seated, she jumped into my chair. once while i was napping, she poured water on
    my pillow and my head. if i try to tell her something she doesn''t want to hear,
    she covers her ears and yells until i stop speaking. when sent to her room, she
    throws terrible tantrums, swears at her mother and threatens to kill herself.
    her parents divorced about a year ago after a strife-filled marriage. do you think
    this child behaves this way to get attention, or is she just hostile? i am supposed
    to baby-sit with her for several months next fall. please advise me. terrified
    grandmother'

    my husband and i received a graduation announcement from "jennifer," the daughter
    of a man who works for the same company my husband works for. they live in another
    state, we have never met the girl, and my husband and her father are not close
    friends. we saw no reason to send this girl a gift, but we did send a very nice
    card. today, we received an acknowledgment from jennifer. inside the envelope
    was the card we had sent her, folded to fit the small envelope. her message was:
    "thank you so much for the nice card for my graduation. i thought maybe you would
    like to use the card again. (signed) jennifer." abby, i never knew it was mandatory
    to send a gift when one receives an announcement. we send graduation gifts to
    all our relatives and friends we know well. were we wrong to send only a card?
    i am now thinking that perhaps she could have used a book on etiquette. please

    when i''m driving on the highway during the day and see a car with its headlights
    on, i blink my headlights to let the driver know his lights are on. once, i was
    stopped by a highway patrol officer who asked me if i had some kind of emergency-and

    i am a 14-year-old female and a freshman in high school. my problem is one that
    most teenage girls have-a snoopy mother. she goes through my drawers and reads
    any letters and notes she finds-then jumps on my case about them. just today she
    cleaned out my purse and proceeded to question me about every little thing in
    it. some people might say that i keep too much from her, but that isn''t true.
    i tell her almost everything about my life. i have considered investing in a small,
    inexpensive safe. would this be too drastic? any answer will be appreciated. no

    my husband and i were out last evening celebrating our wedding anniversary. well,
    one thing led to another, and i asked him if i was the first girl he proposed
    marriage to. he became upset, clammed up and refused to answer. i didn''t ask
    him with any bad intentions-the conversation just flowed in that direction. my
    question: was that a bad thing to ask the man you''ve been married to for several
    years? my attitude is, what''s the difference at this point? i don''t know any
    of his former girlfriends. maybe you could throw this one out your married male

    my stepfather (i''ll call him ralph) and my mother got a divorce last year. since
    then, ralph and his new girlfriend had a baby boy. they named him michael. my
    question: is michael related to me? if yes, what is he to me? is ralph still my
    stepfather? (i still consider him my stepfather, as he is very dear to me.) i
    have a half-brother, "tommy," from the marriage of ralph and my mother. ralph''s
    new baby, michael, would, i believe, be tommy''s half-brother, right? i also have
    a 3-year-old son named victor. if i am related to michael, what would the relationship
    between victor and michael be? also, my mother just remarried again. is her new
    husband also my stepfather, and my son''s stepgrandpa? we would all like to have
    answers to these questions. ralph and i feel that we are still step-relations
    even though he and my mother are no longer married to each other. victor also
    calls ralph "grandpa." is that ok? thank you for straightening all this out. all

    i am a widow in my early 60s. several months ago i started going to baseball games,
    symphony concerts and the theater with a gentleman whose wife died a year ago.
    i really enjoyed his company. two weeks ago he called and asked me to accompany
    him to a function in the middle of the week. i had to decline because i had a
    previous engagement with friends. since then, he hasn''t called me. i don''t know
    whether he''s angry, hurt or out of town. should i call him, and, if i do, what
    excuse do i use for calling? i miss his companionship and the nice places he used
    to take me. stranded in st. louis'

    me, saying it was for "family only." well, alan went to the party without me,

    is also mad at me because i deprived him of the presence of his favorite uncle

    why are the waiting rooms of doctors, dentists, etc., usually furnished with soft,
    low furniture from which people find it very difficult to get up? it would seem
    to me that this furniture is chosen by decorators with only appearance in mind.
    in the may 30, 1988, issue of u.s. news and world report, surgeon general koop
    says in part: "you hear people say, ''my mother fell and fractured her hip.''
    have you ever heard someone say, ''she fractured her hip, and fell''? that''s
    what happens. "people pick the worst seat in the room-soft, low sofas. they have
    trouble getting up, and the hip fractures-then they fall! pick a firm support
    when you stand." abby, you would be doing another public service by bringing this
    to the attention of many people who place this unsuitable furniture in public
    places. alvera elling, sun city, ariz.'

    my husband is my problem. he''s in his late 60s and retired. he is always in a
