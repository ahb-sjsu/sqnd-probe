  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a 14-year-old girl and i''m very worried. my mother is having a baby this
    summer. i''m happy for her and my stepfather (this is their first baby together),
    but i think they are expecting me to take on a lot more responsibility than i
    had anticipated. my mother and my aunts make comments like, "get used to changing
    diapers now, and you''ll be a natural once your new brother is born." or, "just
    think, you have a baby sitter in the house so you won''t have to worry about getting
    one." well, i don''t want to be a mother to this baby. i just want to be a sister,
    one who loves and holds, and occasionally changes diapers or feeds the baby. i
    don''t know how to talk to my mother about this. i am afraid that i will upset
    her and she''ll think i don''t want this newcomer in our family. she has included
    me in a lot of the preparations, like shopping and decorating the baby''s room.
    my mother works full time and my stepfather works six days a week. i already take
    care of my younger sister after school and when my parents go out occasionally.
    i want to enjoy my teen years, free to make my own plans that won''t be overruled
    when my parents want me to baby-sit. can you give me any suggestions? -- the oldest

    i was in a relationship like "confused heart''s." i ended up dating a man for
    13 years. he was too afraid of losing me to let me go, but all the while he never
    gave himself fully to me because he was always wondering what else was out there.
    finally, i left him. my advice: if, after three years of dating, you still have
    a difficult time picturing yourself with your friend for the rest of your life
    -- if it is not how you imagined things should be -- get out. to stay is simply
    leading your girlfriend on and giving her false hope. to jump into marriage at
    this point with all your doubts would surely make you another divorce statistic.
    you would always continue to wonder, as you have put it, "is there real love out
    there?" -- happily married in pennsylvania'

    i am a police officer who spends many hours in local school programs trying to
    get children to trust police officers. it breaks my heart and angers me to hear
    an adult tell a child, "see that officer? if you don''t behave, he''s going to
    put you in jail." the last time i heard a mother say this, she was talking to
    her 3-year-old son! this child then walked up to me almost in tears and asked,
    "are you really going to put me to jail?" that form of "discipline" is not fair
    to us or to the child. first of all, it''s lying to the child. and someday if
    the child should get lost he will think, "i can''t ask a police officer for help
    because he will put me in jail -- mommy and daddy said he would." law enforcement

    three weeks ago, after five years of marriage, my husband and i separated. during
    our five years together we accomplished many of our dreams. we purchased a home,
    opened the business he wanted and took our dream vacation. we''re not from wealthy
    families, so we sacrificed to make our dreams come true and put off having children,
    which we both wanted very much. i believed that marriage should be a 50/50 proposition,
    and so did my husband before we got married. once we were married, it turned out
    that he thought household chores were the woman''s responsibility. for the entire
    five years of our marriage, we struggled over this issue and argued over the smallest
    things. for example, he''d get upset if i didn''t pick up his plate after he ate,
    and i would get upset if he didn''t pick it up himself. it bothered him so much
    he finally confessed there were times when he would eat out before coming home
    in order to avoid a confrontation. in our last attempt at compromise, i told him
    i''d agree to do everything for him if he would support me and let me quit work.
    (i have a full-time job that is quite demanding.) i told him we could go back
    in time and live the way people used to live in the 1950s. his response was, "we''re
    in the ''90s and women are supposed to work. look around and see. that''s the
    way it is. accept it." so i''m asking you, abby. is that how a marriage in the

    why aren''t you more honest with your readers and tell them why so many men are
    nervous about marriage? it''s because the price of marriage is simply too high
    for most men. the majority lose 50 percent of their assets and 100 percent of
    their children when they divorce. they are the ones who pay child support. they
    are the ones who pay alimony. men are the defendants in 70 percent of divorce
    cases and are blamed for most of the problems in a relationship. nobody would
    expect a man to invest in a business with a 50 percent failure rate and long-term
    financial and emotional consequences. so why are women surprised when men balk

    my 17-year-old daughter (i''ll call her carrie) was dating a young man i''ll call
    brad for approximately nine months. carrie has a part-time job that pays for her
    entertainment and also her gas and minor repairs to the car her father and i gave
    her. when the two of them went out, carrie would drive because brad did not have
    his license, let alone a car. he also did not have a job. he managed to find the
    money for tennis shoes that cost $150 a pair, but he never offered to put gas
    in her car. about a month before brad''s birthday, he asked to borrow $50 from
    carrie. he said he''d pay her back when he received money for his birthday. well,
    his birthday came and went, and he made no attempt to pay back the money. he avoided
    her when she went to his house to collect. neither would he return her phone calls.
    i was very upset and told her so. after a month of this, carrie got fed up and
    finally told brad to keep the money -- he was not worth it! i recently found out
    that she has been seeing brad behind my back. when i asked her about it, she said
    she did not tell me because she knew i would be angry. i told her that since her
    father and i were paying for the car, brad was not to ride in it, and i did not
    want him calling my house. i put a block on my phone so that his calls would not
    be received. when carrie found out about this, she became quite upset. now his
    family''s phone has been disconnected and brad goes to a friend''s house to call
    her. every time he calls, i block that number also. i have talked to carrie about
    having respect for herself and not allowing others to take advantage of her. i
    know that this is not my fight, but by accepting brad''s behavior, she is allowing
    him to think he can continue to do this to people. (i have heard through the grapevine

    is no good and she should have more respect for herself? -- frustrated mom in

    why does mental illness, which affects millions of americans, remain so stigmatized
    and misunderstood? my son, mike, finally heard the last voice calling out to him
    from nowhere and saw the last terrible scene that was only in his mind. he died
    in his sleep on july 28, 1992. he often told me that, if he could, he''d just
    "lie down and go to sleep forever, to end it all." he had battled the devastating
    illness of schizophrenia for many years -- and although the disease did not kill
    him, it made him pray to die. no one should have to endure what schizophrenia
    does to the mind, but worse is what society does to its sufferers. if my son had
    been stricken with cancer, he would have received sympathy. because he suffered
    instead from a mental illness that sometimes made him do weird things, he was
    treated as less than an animal by some people. professionals in the judicial system
    referred to him as a "sorry piece of human flesh." he was shunned by people with
    whom he yearned to be friends, and ignored by some family and church members.
    he once confided that sometimes people would say they would be his friend and
    then, when they found out about him, they left. please, abby, urge your readers
    who don''t understand mental illness to try to. there is such a volume of information
    available today that there''s no excuse for being ignorant about it. mental illness
    affects one out of every four families. please tell your readers that if they
    know anyone who''s suffering from mental illness, to reach out. look beyond the

    i am sitting here half-bald after a horrendous trip to two hairdressers. the first
    did such a terrible job that i was forced to go elsewhere to get my hairdo repaired.
    i went to the first salon for a simple trim. although i explained what i wanted
    and even showed a picture to the hairdresser, i had the uneasy feeling she didn''t
    understand. at that point, however, my hair had already been washed and i felt
    as though i had no choice but to go through with the haircut. when she was finished,
    i was left with a disaster on my head. my hair was much shorter than i''d requested,
    with two thin layers that didn''t blend together. i looked ridiculous and the
    hairdresser knew it. she asked me if i wanted her to take a little more off the
    top to help blend the layers, but i quickly said no. she charged me $24, which
    i reluctantly paid. i then had to pay more money to correct the disaster on my
    head. after hours of combing, curling and crying, i am turning to you for advice.

    a stylist, is it socially acceptable to refuse service (even after he/she has

    the letter you recently printed from "the goodbye wife in california," who listed
    the reasons to leave her husband, hit home with me. i clipped it, and checked
    off the reasons with which i identified. it had a profound effect on me. before
    i read that letter, i had been reminiscing about the pleasant moments i had shared
    with my former husband, and had started once again to blame all our problems on
    myself. (i had not been understanding enough; i couldn''t cook well enough; etc.)
    i fantasized that we could be united as a family again. my 15-year-old daughter
    lives with me, and my 17-year-old son lives with his father. i miss my son and
    the good things about our family life. however, the letter in your column was
    a sobering and much-needed reminder of the sometimes subtle, but always devastating
    effects of being the object of intermittent humiliation, ridicule, name-calling,
    intimidation and physical abuse. the writer mentioned that she had not yet left
    her abuser, and knew it was easier said than done. i know exactly what she''s
    experiencing. she is most likely feeling ambivalent, because abused women usually
    have thinking patterns that reflect the destructive effect of abuse. we tend to
    gloss over the bad parts and glorify the good things (there are some good things
    even in a relationship of this kind, which is one of the most confusing aspects
    of living with an abuser). she may blame herself. she may be hoping her husband
    will see the error of his ways by reading her letter in your column and miraculously
    change. i want her to know: that is a fantasy. it will never happen. he will not
    change, nor will he even admit he needs to. worse yet, her children will learn
    the same inappropriate patterns of behavior. she needs to leave that marriage
    as soon as possible and begin repairing the damage this man has inflicted. she
    must be prepared to experience the temptation to return to him as if everything
    would magically be better. she''ll probably have difficulty relating in a healthy
    way to a kind and gentle man, but with therapy to assist in the healing process,
    she will be able to rebuild her self-esteem and be able to love again. now i''ll
    tell you how her letter came to impact me: i left the column (with my check marks
    on it) in my bathroom. while my daughter and i were out, my former husband and
    my son came into my home. my ex found the column and observed that i had checked
    most of the items on the list. did he recognize himself? did he suddenly empathize
    with my feelings? did he want to talk over the issues? no. he showed the list
    to my son. the two of them laughed about it and ridiculed me when i returned.
    my son then derisively described the list to my daughter. for the first time in
    the many years i have known this man, i saw him clearly for what he really is.
    to enter my home, read personal things that pertain only to our relationship and
    then share them with our son is the most obvious example i will ever need of what
    emotional abuse is. i thank your reader for the boost her letter provided me.
    i hope she will successfully negotiate the road to her personal recovery. it won''t
    be easy, but there''s a light at the end of the tunnel. and now, i can finally
    begin to get on with the rest of my life -- thanks to reading her letter in your
    column. -- been there in florida'

    i am a 70-year-old man whose wife died two years ago. for the past year, i have
    been dating a spry widow whose husband died about the same time my wife died.
    we have a lovely relationship and have talked about getting married. the problem
    is her dead husband''s ashes. she keeps them in a fancy gold box on the mantle
    of her fireplace. i just recently found out what is in the box, and i think this
    is morbid. sometimes she stands in front of the box and reminisces about her dead
    husband. her family tells me that she has requested that her husband''s ashes
    be placed in her coffin when she dies. i find this somewhat disturbing. i had
    a serious talk with her, so she knows i object to having the remains of her husband
    on the mantle. i would like a permanent relationship, and she has told me she
    loves me and is interested in getting married. however, she is not willing to
    remove the ashes from the mantle. abby, do other people keep ashes of the dead
    in their homes? how can i get her to remove them? -- ashes in audubon, n.j.'

    you printed a letter from hugo borreson who said that the civil rights movement
    in the 1960s "reminds us of how violent white christians really are." he also
    includes some 5,000 lynchings that have taken place in history as a supportive
    example of white christians'' brutality. it is true that there have been atrocities
    committed over the centuries by those who call themselves christians. it is also
    true that christianity teaches nonviolence and love toward your neighbor (and
    your enemy, for that matter). but it is absolutely not true that simply calling
    yourself a christian means that you are one. the bible says that we will know
    a christian by his actions. the traits listed in galatians 5:22-23 (love, joy,
    peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control)
    are demonstrated in the christian. do you think that the so-called "christians"
    responsible for the 5,000 lynchings in history fit this description? those who
    call themselves christians but do not live like it are often called hypocrites,
    and rightly so. however, the presence of hypocrites does not discredit the christian
    faith. rather, it brings shame to those who stoop so low as to say one thing and
    do another. -- vanessa harikul, 16, moorpark, calif.'

    recently in a department store, i overheard a conversation between two women that
    made my blood boil. one woman identified a neighbor by saying, "the one with the
    adopted son." abby, i am 42 years old and was adopted at birth. my adoptive mother
    was the nurse assisting in the delivery, and my adoptive father was also present
    at birth. in fact, while anxiously waiting to see his new daughter, dad slipped
    and fell, so we joke, "dad sure fell for his daughter." my loving parents told
    me early on that i was adopted and did it in such a way that i felt adopted meant
    "special" and "handpicked." perhaps the comment hit a nerve because my aunts,
    uncles and cousins from both sides of the family often referred to my brother
    and me as "marvin and ethel''s adopted kids." my parents and grandparents were
    never guilty of using that unnecessary adjective. does "adopted" mean "less than"?
    am i less of a daughter because someone else gave birth to me? even at my grandmother''s
    funeral, i was mentioned as her "adopted granddaughter." sadly, my extended family
    still, after all these years, treats me as though i am not part of the "real"
    family. abby, the purpose of my letter is to let people know they do damage by
    distinguishing between "the adopted kids" and "the kids." the mother and father
    who adopted me, fed me, clothed me and disciplined me were my parents, and our
    family is as "real" as the families into which other children are "born." i would
    be proud to have you use my name. -- marva boehm mason, houston'

    we have spent, the experiences we''ve had and the bond we share. the problem is
    that we''re at the age when a great many of our friends are married or getting
    married. i have a feeling that she could see herself married to me, but i have
    always had a difficult time picturing myself with her for the rest of my life.
    i come from a family that has experienced two divorces, which makes me feel very
    strongly that i do not want to enter into marriage unless i''m absolutely committed
    and sure it will be ''til death do us part. also, i have always subscribed to
    the belief that when you''re in love and want to get married, there should be
    very little doubt that this is something you want to do. i have doubts. i guess
    i''m wondering if there isn''t someone out there i''m missing, and i don''t want
    to rush into anything that i could regret forever. at the same time, there is
    nothing better than having someone who cares for you and for whom you care --
    it''s just not how i imagined things would be. am i living in a fairy-tale world,
    or is there a real love out there, one where there are no doubts? everyone i know
    would probably say we have a good relationship and should stay together. i''m
    interested in what you and your readers might have to say. how do you define love?

    this letter is in response to "needing more in minneapolis," who wrote concerning
    a new man in her life who apparently has all the qualities she desires except
    that he is a "lousy lover." i would like to know the definition of a lousy lover.
    does it involve physical attributes, technique, holding and caressing, or other
    things perhaps better left unmentioned in polite circles? i realize that beauty
    lies in the eyes of the beholder, but does the definition of a lousy lover lie
    in the mind of the recipient? most women i ask about this subject politely avoid
    answering the question, but i''m sure it is a frequent topic of conversation during
    "girl talk." abby, please ask your female readers to respond to this subject.
    perhaps their responses can be reduced to a definition of what a lousy (or great)
    lover really is. i''m sure that many men who read your column will benefit from
    their responses. -- edward g. grier jr., san diego'

    couple is clearly able to attend to their needs, so why is it they can''t take
    care of their own wedding? i don''t condemn this couple. if i knew them i would

    maybe this daughter''s plans will turn out well. but i would never call her mother
    insensitive or rigid, either. the daughter has shown her lack of respect for all
    the parents hold dear, so why should she want or need their help with her long
    overdue wedding? she has already set up housekeeping, so why have a shower? since
    she and her friend have already consummated a marriage, who needs a fancy wedding?
    the money might be more helpful later. the votes won''t be in until the daughter''s
    own children are old enough to do likewise. as the old-timers say, "what goes
    around comes around." i suggest that what is now "modern practice" is not necessarily

    you asked for acts of kindness. well, here is mine: in june of last year, my husband
    and i went to germany and austria on vacation. while we were in austria, my husband
    stumbled and fell, breaking his hip, which required hospitalization and surgery.
    i remained by his side in the recovery room until i was asked to leave at 1 a.m.
    i have never felt so alone. the next morning, the bad luck continued. in my haste
    to get back to the hospital, i accidentally locked our hotel room key and the
    car keys in the trunk of our rented car. when i finally located a locksmith, he
    charged $103 to unlock the trunk because it was on a saturday. my husband spent
    the next two weeks in the hospital in salzburg, recovering enough to withstand
    the 14-hour flight back to our home. when my husband was finally discharged, the
    hospital demanded payment in cash, as did the ambulance company. the airline also
    insisted on cash to pay for the upgrade in seats necessary to make my husband
    comfortable on our flight home. we had prepaid for our vacation and didn''t have
    a great deal of cash with us, so i had to go from bank to bank to get cash advances
    from our credit cards. it was difficult because on one day the computer would
    process the transaction, but the next day for some reason, it wouldn''t -- "trouble
    on the phone lines," we were told. the language barrier made things doubly difficult.
    it was in frankfurt, germany, however, where the real trouble occurred. my husband,
    who was in a wheelchair, had to wait for me around the corner down a long hallway
    while i tried in vain to pay for the upgrade with our credit cards. i argued,
    pleaded and begged to see an airline representative or someone from the american
    embassy, but the ticket agent wouldn''t budge. i feared we were stranded. as luck
    would have it, a gentleman standing in the next line turned and asked me what
    the trouble was. i told him how we couldn''t get home after all the difficulty
    we''d been through. he opened his wallet, then handed me 50 $100 bills! my mouth
    hung open in total shock. he took my name and address, gave me his business card,
    and went on his way. out of possibly 6 billion people on this planet, what were
    my chances of a good samaritan with that much cash standing next to me offering
    that kind of help? i believe the stranger was an angel in disguise. i want to
    thank him publicly. his name is charan kumar. your readers might like to know
    that there are still some very kind and generous people in this world. -- judy

    my parents have invited my wife and me and my two sisters and their families on
    a 12-day cruise at their expense. they have never made such a trip before, and
    my father''s declining health may make traveling impossible in the future. both
    my wife and i get along with my parents very well. we see them once or twice a
    year. our problem: they have invited only grandchildren who are more than 6 years
    of age. there are many reasons: small children would make the trip less relaxing
    for everyone; there are a variety of programs for children aged 6 and older, but
    not younger; the cabins accommodate only groups of four; and younger children
    wouldn''t remember the trip anyway. my wife and i would be taking two of our children
    and leaving two -- ages 2 and 4 -- at home. one of my sisters would be leaving
    two of her four children at home, and my other sister would be leaving both of
    hers. we have a very reliable friend who has taken care of all of our children
    when my wife and i have gone away together (for as long as six days), so that''s
    not the issue. i see this as a wonderful opportunity. our older children would
    have the time of their lives, and while i''d miss the younger ones, i also know
    they would be just fine. my wife, however, feels it would be difficult for the
    4-year-old. although neither of us feels he would suffer permanent emotional scars,
    my wife says she wouldn''t enjoy the trip if she had to worry about him. she feels
    put on the spot by my parents by being forced either to be the party pooper or
    to do something she feels uncomfortable about. she says it would be much easier
    on the 4-year-old if we took none of the children, but i would love to share this
    experience with the older ones. she has offered to stay home while i take the
    older two, but i like that idea even less. the issue has been tabled for the last
    three months, but our positions have not changed. i''m unwilling to concede that
    the trip, as planned, needs to be scrapped. she''s unwilling to concede that it
    would be no big deal to leave the two younger children at home. how should this
    be resolved? -- one family''s fortune'

    my boyfriend, with whom i have been living for the past seven years, keeps a post
    office box in another town. i have been curious as to why, so i asked him last
    night because the subject of mail came up. (i had asked before, but got no reasonable
    answer.) he immediately became agitated and defensive and said it was none of
    my business. i told him that he was not reacting rationally and the reason he
    offered -- that he didn''t want to do the paperwork to switch over to our hometown
    post office or home delivery -- didn''t make any sense to me. at that point he
    stomped away from the dinner table and claimed the real reason i asked that question
    had to do with lack of trust. it''s true, abby. when our relationship was rocky
    a year ago, i learned that other women used that p.o. box to write to him. (he
    never confessed his affairs; i discovered them myself and confronted him.) what
    is the real reason he is keeping this p.o. box? he says he wants to marry me,

    i''ve never written before, but i''m sure you''ll receive a lot of mail about
    the letter you printed from "young mother in pennsylvania." she wrote, "i know
    claire better than anyone else, so shouldn''t i know the best way to be a parent
    to her?" your answer was, "yes, stick to your convictions." i believe you overlooked
    a few things when you gave that answer. first of all, she''s married at 19, they''re
    living with her parents until they can get on their feet, and they have a 9-month-old
    child. it appears they entered the marriage without considering the costs of living
    together as a married couple, and to complicate matters, they had a child within
    the first year. (i''m not even considering the possibility of conception before
    marriage.) however you look at it, this constitutes lack of wisdom. she also said
    that although both of their parents "did a good job in raising them," now she
    suddenly feels she knows more than they do because she "knows her child." abby,
    loving her child and being with her doesn''t equate with wisdom in raising a child.
    the problem appears to lie in her statement, "... what seems like advice to them
    sounds like criticism to me." her viewpoint needs a little readjustment! granted,
    not all of their suggestions may be the best, but that doesn''t mean she should
    throw the combined total of 40 years'' experience out the window. she should sift
    through it and apply what appears reasonable. she should also be grateful for
    their advice and realize that they want what''s best for both her and the grandchild
    because they love them. viewing it from that perspective will help her gain wisdom
    and cope with the situation until they can move out on their own. -- second opinion

    when i became engaged, my future mother-in-law gave me a lovely diamond ring that
    had been in her family for three generations. i was thrilled and have cherished
    it. i know that it is worth several thousand dollars. i am now divorced, and she
    has asked me to please return the ring. i love her very much and couldn''t refuse
    her or fight over it, but that ring means a lot to me. i would have had the stone

    "just say no, my foot" could have been writing about me. like his wife, i was

    we got some marital counseling together. it is now seven years later. i have two
    children under 2 years old and have sex almost every day. most of the time i initiate
    it! what has caused this dramatic change? my husband. my "new" husband tells me
    how pretty i am, even though i have gained 30 pounds after having the babies.
    he takes my hand in the car and puts his arm around me while watching television.
    when i''m cooking or tending to the baby, he comes up behind me, rubs my shoulders,
    and tells me what a good wife and mother i am. at night, when i''m dead tired,
    he puts his arms around me, tells me how wonderful i am and strokes my hair as
    i fall asleep. my husband also goes out of his way to make time for sex when i
    am awake and in the mood. sometimes this means coming home from work in the middle

    this problem may sound inconsequential, but it sure is annoying. in fact, i am
    steaming. i want a second tea bag! whenever we eat out, my wife orders coffee
    and i order tea. usually the coffee and tea cost the same, so why is it that the
    servers come around with big pots of fresh coffee, endlessly refilling my wife''s
    cup for free, yet when i ask for a refill, i only get more hot water? when i ask
    for a new tea bag, i''m almost always told, "i''ll have to charge you for a new
    cup." abby, if you''ve ever had to reuse a tea bag, you know that it makes a weak,
    disgusting cup of tea. a box of 100 tea bags is, at most, $4.50 in a supermarket;
    presumably, restaurants buy in bulk and pay less. that means a cup of tea costs
    them less than 5 cents (there''s no point in including the cost of water and heating,
    since that''s also done for free coffee refills). considering that restaurants
    charge anywhere from 85 cents to $1.10 for a cup of tea, i would hope that they
    could shell out four whole pennies for another tea bag for their customers --
    customers who certainly order more than just tea, and leave a tip besides. abby,
    since your column is read daily in restaurants and diners across america and canada,
    perhaps you can help me and thousands of other tea drinkers by printing this:
    restaurateurs: if you''re going to be generous enough to offer a second cup of
    coffee free (and a third and a fourth), kindly treat your hot-tea drinkers with
    the same generosity. -- tea-ed off in new york'

    six years ago, i met a man who seemed to adore me. we fell in love, he gave me
    a ring, we talked marriage and bought a beautiful home together. sounds great,

    for him to set a date. he never did, so i finally got up enough nerve to ask him.
    he replied that he was "nervous" about the thought of marriage. i felt emotionally
    abandoned by his reply. since that time, my self-esteem has almost disappeared.
    friends, family and co-workers ask me (especially around valentine''s day), "when

    i''m continually amazed by people who write to you with righteous indignation
    about gifts that weren''t good enough, objects they feel entitled to, or inheritances
    that they expect to receive. don''t these people understand the concept of a gift?
    a wedding (or birthday or christmas) gift is not an obligation, it is a generosity.
    an inheritance is not a right; it is a choice made by the benefactors to bestow
    upon whomever they wish. i get the feeling that many of your readers would lead
    happier lives if they would quit worrying about what they think they''re entitled
    to, and concentrated on earning what is theirs and being grateful for the gifts
    they receive. my dear grandmother (whom i prefer alive, lucid, happy and loving

    we hear so many horror stories concerning children of divorce, it might be encouraging
    to hear of one where both parents handle the situation very well. since the divorce
    seven years ago, the two children (now 11 and 13) have been in the custody of
    their mother. of course, the father has visitation rights. never has either parent
    said anything derogatory about the other. the two have always lived in different
    areas -- now cleveland and dayton, ohio -- and each has initiated phone calls
    to the other for the children. when the mother (my daughter) goes to her air force
    reserve duty in dayton, the children stay with their father, and occasionally,
    she, too, stays there. similarly, when the father and his wife come to cleveland
    to see the children, they have stayed at my daughter''s home -- as have his relatives.
    last christmas, they had the greatest arrangements, demonstrating what exemplary
    parents they are -- the new wife included. during the christmas vacation, the
    girls spent several days with their father, then on christmas eve when he brought
    them back to their mother''s home, he and his wife stayed overnight, so they could
    all share christmas morning with the children. abby, wouldn''t it be wonderful

    here''s one for which i would appreciate a solution. the guys at the office didn''t
    have an answer. i was at a very crowded shopping mall and needed to use the rest
    room as i was leaving. the men''s room and the ladies'' room were side by side.
    the ladies'' room had a line outside it, while the men''s room had no waiting
    line. as i approached the men''s room, the women started to grumble loudly about
    having to wait and split up into lines outside both rest rooms. this effectively
    restricted my access to the men''s room, so i departed the mall and drove to the
    nearest gas station to use the rest room there. what should a male''s proper course
    of action be in a situation like this? -- legs crossed in newark'

    the story of the spanish speakers who assumed two blond anglos wouldn''t understand
    their rude comments reminds me of two incidents. a blond man my husband works
    with had learned hmong while serving in vietnam. one day he was on the paris subway
    while two girls were speaking hmong to each other, harshly criticizing fellow
    passengers. the man waited until a break in their conversation, then gave them
    an equally bold critique -- in fluent hmong. they were so stunned, they missed
    their stop. then there was the deaf woman i often waited on in a fabric shop where
    i worked. she liked for me to help her since i would sign "hi" (the only word
    i knew in sign language), speak clearly while facing her, and take the time to
    puzzle out her speech. one day she told me that two women shopping nearby were
    planning to steal quite a few very expensive buttons by tucking them into the
    folds of the fabric they were buying. sure enough, the manager stopped the women
    outside the store and the buttons were in the fabric. how did my customer know?
    she had read their lips! -- coryn weigle, alexandria, va.'

    how do you deal with relatives who have pets that are treated just like people?
    i have two sets of family members who own dogs. one has three and the other has
    one, and they treat their dogs as though they are members of the family. i like
    dogs, but i''m not a "dog person." i don''t think it''s cute when their dog climbs
    on my furniture or begs at the dinner table. when they visit me, they not only
    allow their dogs on my furniture, they actually let the dog sleep in bed with
    them underneath the covers. these relatives were visiting recently, and we were
    having a nice family dinner when their dog came to the table, put her front paws
    on the table and her nose in my plate. the owner remarked, "she''s just curious
    about what''s going on." he didn''t tell the dog to get down. i have a small baby,
    and the dog was very curious about her. i think a dog licking a baby''s mouth
    and face is disgusting. when the dog came over to investigate my baby, i felt
    uncomfortable pushing it away, since it''s not my dog. the owner didn''t do a
    thing. when the dog licked my baby''s mouth, she simply said, "she''s just curious
    about what''s going on." abby, i thought i''d die! i don''t feel comfortable reprimanding
    someone else''s dog, especially one they think is a human, but what should i do
    when the owners give these animals no discipline? what people do in their own
    homes with their pets is their business, and if i happen to be visiting them,
    i will bite my tongue and deal with the dogs at the dinner table and on the furniture.
    but when someone comes to my home, i would like some respect for my property,
    and i certainly do not want dogs near my baby. am i being selfish? -- dogged out

    i am writing because i am very disturbed by the lack of morals in our young people
    today. our daughter just became engaged after more than two years of living with
    her male friend. they didn''t have the respect to care what we thought, and they
    knew how we felt because they were told that we will not visit them where they
    live. (we do see them at our home.) they expected us to be delighted over their
    engagement. i felt it was time they were married, not engaged to live together
    for yet another year. i was also surprised that her live-in boyfriend came to
    us to ask for permission to marry our daughter. (when they are breaking all the
    old traditions, why believe in this one?) needless to say, we were not very receptive,
    and said neither "yes" nor "no." after all, a few years of living together will
    not prove that their marriage will last. i am also upset because our fine "strict"
    catholic church doesn''t address this subject from the pulpit. i''d like to add
    that because of the live-in situation, i will neither have nor will i attend any
    bridal showers. nor will i pay for the wedding. i would like to hear your opinion.

    the side of my bed and took my hands between hers and started to talk. suddenly,
    she let go of my hands, peeled off her gloves, and then she clasped my hands again.

    on the ground or rain clouds in the forecast, but regardless of what the weatherman
    says, there is sunshine and springtime in our hearts. years ago, in celebration
    of valentine''s day, i decided to write my own ten commandments, the ten commandments
    of love. actually, at the time i was so enthusiastic that i wrote 20 -- one set
    for men and another for women. but then i received a letter from mandy stillman,
    a lawyer from milwaukee, insisting that there be only one set of commandments.
    she was right, of course. and here they are for your review: the ten commandments
    of love -- put your spouse before your mother, your father, your son and your
    daughter. your mate is your lifelong companion. -- do not abuse your body with
    excessive food, tobacco, drink, or any foreign substance that goes into your arm
    or up your nose. -- remember that cleanliness is a virtue. -- willingly share
    all of your worldly goods with your mate. -- do not forget to say, "i love you."
    even though your love may be constant, your spouse needs to hear those cherished
    words often. -- remember that the approval of your spouse is worth far more than
    the adoring glances of a hundred strangers, so be true and forsake all others.
    -- permit neither your business nor your hobby to make you a stranger to your
    children. the most precious gift a parent can give is time. -- keep your home
    in good repair, because out of it come the joys of old age (not to mention its
    resale value). -- forgive with grace, because who among us does not need to be
    forgiven? -- honor the lord your god every day of your life, and your children
    will grow up and bless you. today, be a sweetheart. call someone you love and
    say, "i love you." (make two or three calls; who says you can''t love more than
    one person -- in different ways, of course.) go through your closets and give
    all those clothes you''ve been saving until you lose 10 pounds to your favorite
    charity. call someone who''s lonely and say, "i''m thinking of you." or, better
    yet, say, "i''ll be over tomorrow to take you to lunch -- or to run some errands
    for you -- or to give you a ride." visit a sick friend. say a prayer. donate some
    blood. adopt a pet. will your eyes, your kidneys and all your usable organs to
    someone who can use them after you''re gone. forgive an enemy. hug your teen-ager.
    write a fan letter. listen to a bore. pay your doctor. tell your parents you think
    they''re wonderful. spay your dog. neuter your cat. quit smoking. drive carefully.
    if you''re walking, watch where you''re going. and don''t wait until next year
    to be a sweetheart again. -- love, abby'

    there is no reason for anyone to be ignorant of god''s word, especially the ten
    commandments. if everyone obeyed these clear and simple rules, all the problems
    in the world would disappear! as a matter of fact, the ten commandments are the
    transcript of god''s character and the pure foundational law of his universal
    and eternal government. i noticed that you did not print the entire wording of
    the ten commandments in your column. you left out a portion of the wording in
    the first, second, third, fourth and fifth commandments. why? have you never read
    verses 18 and 19 from the 22nd chapter of the book of revelation? it says, "for
    i testify unto every man that heareth the word of the prophesy of this book, if
    any man shall add unto these things, god shall add unto him the plagues that are
    written in this book; and if any man shall take away from the words of the book
    of this prophecy, god shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out
    of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book." every "jot
    and tittle" written in god''s word is extremely important. no human has the right
    to tamper with it in any way. the reason people do not know what the ten commandments
    say is just a matter of priorities. god''s word is not important enough for them
    to spend time searching the scriptures and applying the instructions to their
    lives. people are "too busy" these days with the "cares of this life." and one
    of these days, it will be too late. signs of the end of time are fast fulfilling
    all around us, and people are as blind and unbelieving as they were in the days
    of noah. abby, i challenge you to print this letter in your column, and end it
    by printing the entire wording of all of the ten commandments, and i challenge
    your readers to read exodus 20 for themselves. if it makes a difference in only
    one person''s life for eternity, it will be well worth honoring this request.

    excuse me for being an old fuddy-duddy, but what has happened to basic good manners?
    in my day one did not indulge in kissing in public places -- unless one was bidding
    goodbye in an airport, train or bus station. i find it embarrassing to witness
    public displays of affection between my nephew and his current girlfriend at family
    gatherings in nice restaurants. often they have to stop right in the middle of
    the restaurant on the way out to engage in a long, soulful kiss. since the couple
    have been living together for several months, it would seem that they could hold
    off the kissing until they were alone. this has gotten to the point that it is
    downright embarrassing for the rest of the family to go out with them. don''t
    get me wrong, abby. i am all for hugging and kissing one''s true love, but not
    on the way out of a nice restaurant with a room full of strangers to witness the
    spectacle. am i hopelessly outdated on this? -- old-fashioned'

    i have recently married a wonderful woman whom i consider the girl of my dreams,
    and i don''t want to spoil what we have together. my problem is an old girlfriend
    from my college days. throughout the years, we have remained in contact, mostly
    because of her persistence. i''ve wanted to cut the string with this woman for
    years, but i didn''t want to hurt her feelings and saw no harm in maintaining
    a long-distance friendship, although her dependency on me and her references to
    me as her "soul mate" have concerned me. i was relieved when she finally married,
    but after her marriage came letters and phone calls, complaining about her husband
    and asking me for advice. she has told me intimate details about him, and frankly,
    i don''t want to share this kind of information about her with my wife. she treats
    my wife with disregard, sending letters addressed only to me. her only references
    to my marriage are the ones that blame it for the lack of communication between
    us. although i once had affection for her, i no longer want this woman in my life,
    but this decision makes me feel like a heel. abby, is a man a heel for wanting
    to put to rest an old relationship? have you any suggestions for ending this friendship
    once and for all? ignoring her phone messages and letters hasn''t seemed to work,

    how "white" of you! when "a proud shoshone" in wisconsin asked about the origin
    of the term "indian giver," you went to the printed reference books. why didn''t
    you ask a tribal elder? our elders have taught us that the term described native
    actions in a negative light because whites did not understand them. (there are
    more than 500 tribes, so a blanket statement or description is impossible and
    inaccurate.) in some tribes, if someone admired something, the owner gave it to
    the admirer. if good will existed, a native would give a gift to a person. if
    something happened to destroy that good will or friendship, the native would take
    back the gift. it was a basic, simple act, totally misunderstood by the europeans,
    who thought it was terrible and made it more than it truly was. -- a proud cherokee/colville'

    perhaps the white settlers used the phrase "indian giver" with each other when
    giving something they expected back, just as they knew that when their government
    gave land to the indians, the government would eventually take it back. the same
    could be said for "indian" being used as a synonym for bogus or false, for the
    supposed valuables given to the indians in trade were often things that had little
    or no value to the whites who had given them. with the passage of time, the victims
    were blamed with these false labels. make sense? i am not an indian. -- seeing

    i am a divorced woman with three children, 11, 10 and 7. through the internet,

    week at my home at christmas. he and my children got along great; in fact, they

    looks are not that important, and i would have to look far to find a man who will
    treat me with such respect and consideration. dan told me he is considering moving
    to california at the end of the school year so we can be closer. i hate to be
    so superficial that i would miss out on a fulfilling relationship because dan
    is not better looking. i certainly love who he is on the inside, but i know some

    move out here. what if things didn''t work out? he says that is a chance he is
    willing to take. he makes me very happy and is always on my mind. i want to call

    why do people with small children feel it is necessary to take these children
    with them when they go to the movies? i went to four r-rated, action-packed movies
    last summer, and in three of them there were parents with crying children. i see
    the same thing every time i go to the movies. don''t these parents know that their
    children are not going to enjoy the movie? why should they? they are sitting in
    a dark, strange place with many strangers they can''t see, there is nothing for
    them to play with, and there are loud, strange noises all around them. here is
    my message to parents: if your child is under the age of 2, he or she is not going
    to enjoy a movie no matter what the rating is. if your child is under the age
    of 6, he or she should not be going to anything over a pg rating. make the cost
    of the baby sitter part of the cost for an evening out. most sitters will charge
    only $3 or $4 per hour for a small child. if you can''t afford a baby sitter,
    stay home and rent a movie. it''s better for you, better for your child, and for

    is there a kind and tactful way to tell a distant relative to stop making donations
    to his favorite charities in our names? he''s a very nice man and we know he means
    well. obviously, he has the right to donate to any organization he wants, but
    he should do it in his own name -- not ours. people who perform this act of kindness
    may not realize the uneasy position in which they place "fake donors." we feel
    hypocritical for the beneficiaries thinking we did the good deed, when the money
    didn''t come from us. another undesirable side effect of vicarious giving is the
    glut of requests and junk mail that hound us for months (or years) after the donation.
    we have our own preferred charities and do not wish to receive requests from organizations
    we do not support, however worthwhile they may be. on one occasion when a family
    member died, a self-appointed philanthropist made a very generous donation to
    his favorite charity in memory of the deceased, and indicated it came from us.
    abby, you can imagine our embarrassment and discomfort when his widow thanked
    us heartily for our generous gift. perhaps a comment in your column to people
    who give this kind of gift, suggesting that they first ask the donors if they
    would like to have their names on a donation, would help to curb this practice.
    some people may not want to be identified with a particular organization. and
    i''m sure even fewer will want the junk mail that follows. thank you for any suggestions

    i work at the customer service desk at a popular shopping mall, where i see some
    very disturbing things. for example, lost children are brought to us until their
    parents miss them and seek help. it''s not uncommon for parents to leave small
    children watching a display, telling them, "stay right here -- i''m going to do
    a little shopping." children have little conception of time, and will sometimes
    panic, thinking they have been abandoned. when they finally locate their lost
    children, the parents get angry at the kids -- often spanking them and verbally
    berating them for getting lost. don''t they realize that it''s the adults'' responsibility
    to keep their eyes on their child -- and not the other way around? something else
    we see all too often is a parent telling the child, "if you don''t behave, that
    policeman -- or security guard -- will get you." this makes children afraid to
    approach a policeman if they need help. i have seen children ask complete strangers
    to help them find their mommy rather than security because they are afraid of
    policemen. i don''t have any children, but i feel lucky to be able to dry the
    eyes of lost children and help them find their parents. what if they asked for
    help from the wrong person? like it or not, there are a lot of evil people out
    there just looking for the opportunity to abduct a lost child. abby, this may
    be too long to print, but i know you can shorten it and say it better. perhaps

    i am an elderly widow who lives alone. i''m writing to share a special kindness
    one of my daughters does for me. sue visits me for a weekend about once a month.
    when she comes, she brings a collection of one-portion frozen treats that reflects
    her cooking during the month. there are portions of her big batches of soup, spaghetti
    sauce with meatballs, stews, etc. i no longer cook things like that just for myself,
    so they are welcome indeed. she says that when she''s cooking, it makes her happy
    to put aside a serving for me. every time i take one of her entrees from my freezer,

    i am really confused. i am 21 years old and i have two small children. i got pregnant
    and married at 17, so i haven''t had much experience at life. i felt if i was
    woman enough to get pregnant, i was woman enough to take care of the child and
    raise it as best i could -- and i am doing that. it never bothered me that i didn''t
    have much of a teen-age life because i had been through a lot and had grown up
    fast. my husband, on the other hand, was not at all ready for a family. he married
    me, but when my baby was 8 months old he started messing around, so i left. when
    i came back, things were ok -- but then he started drinking a lot and got both
    mentally and physically abusive. things just seemed to get worse and worse, so
    i kicked him out. then i found out i was pregnant with our second child. i didn''t
    know what to do. he was living with some other girl and still coming to my home,
    making my life a living hell. then he told me he wanted to come back to his family
    -- so like a fool, i took him back. after my second child was born, i thought
    things were all right. but then i discovered that he was still seeing the same
    girl and that she had a baby. he swears it''s not his; she says it is. now he
    has decided that he''s finally ready to be a father and husband. i don''t know
    what i want to do. i have held on and been through so much for him. but i don''t
    trust him and don''t know that i ever will. i don''t have the same love for him
    that i once did. should i continue this relationship? should i call it quits?
    do you believe someone can change his whole way of life in only a few short months?
    please help me. i don''t know what to do. -- lost in jackson, miss.'

    please add this to your collection of "acts of kindness." back in 1990, i saw
    the movie "crazy people," starring dudley moore. it was about people with mental
    illness bonding together to become productive citizens. this movie sent a clear
    message to the public that mental illness is just that -- an illness. since i
    suffer from clinical depression and have for most of my life, i wrote a letter

    is dudley moore calling." abby, he was so interested in my illness, so supportive
    and caring. he was modest and sincere. i can''t tell you what a big help it was

    the letter from "d.w. in reno, nev." about giving needy children books for the
    holidays caught my attention. i would like to tell d.w. about rolling readers,
    california''s largest nonprofit children''s literacy organization. it was started
    in 1961 by a father, who -- after noticing the profound effects of reading aloud
    to his sons -- volunteered to read to kids at a homeless shelter. the experience
    was very rewarding (as i can attest, because i am a rolling reader volunteer),
    and it took only an hour per week. and after that, he began recruiting others
    with a love of books, reading and children. we volunteers go to our assigned schools
    (or other locations, such as homeless shelters) once a week and read aloud to
    one or more classes. three times a year we have a book give-away when each child
    gets his or her own new book. we hope that by reading aloud to children, we will
    help them to learn to read; and that, by giving them books of their own, they
    will learn to love reading. i always tell my "story children" that education is
    one of the most important gifts of life, and the key to a good education is reading.
    besides, it''s fun! children love to hear stories, but they are thrilled to have
    their own books. "i don''t have to bring it back, miss mary ann? you mean i can
    keep it?" i am often asked by children who never before owned a book. it''s been
    four years since my first book give-away, and kids stop me on the playground and
    tell me they still have the first book i gave them. abby, i hope you will let
    your readers know about rolling readers. -- miss mary ann, volunteer, braddock

    she complains of migraines, stomach flu and colds, and has been plagued by numerous

    be conscientious about her schooling, and her assignments are always completed
    at home. her stay-at-home mother dotes excessively on her daughter''s complaints

    i read your answer to "perplexed in riverdale," concerning the woman whose husband
    was a retired naval officer who required his daughter to call his fellow officers
    by their rank. you agreed with the naval officer, stating that "a 12-year-old
    (especially the daughter of a naval officer) should have no trouble remembering
    the ranks of her father''s fellow officers." your answer upset me no end. i am
    a retired veteran of 20 years of service, and the day i retired was the day i
    hung up my uniform and my rank. however, it seems as though some retired officers
    have a hard time separating themselves from the military, especially feeling like
    nobodies since they are no longer in power. the 12-year-old girl is not in the
    military, and therefore should not be required to remember any military rank or
    call any military personnel by their rank. during my tenure in the military, i
    often had active-duty personnel ask me which rank came after so-and-so (e.g. what
    is the next rank after a full colonel?). these were personnel with up to three
    and four years of service. what would ever make you believe that any civilian,
    whether 12 or 50 years old, would have the need to know the level of military
    ranks? my wife, for instance, served with me for a period of 16 years as a civilian.
    when asked about a person''s rank, her answer was, "i don''t know any rank in
    the military other than my husband''s. he''s a sergeant." i sincerely don''t think
    she even knew what level i held as a sergeant. and that was fine with me, because
    i was in the military, not my wife or children. so neither my wife nor my four
    sons were ever required by me to refer to any of my friends by their rank. in
    my view, you goofed big time. i would suggest you retract your answer to "perplexed
    in silverdale" and let this 12-year-old child be a civilian -- which she is! --

    as a gentleman, i greet other men with a firm handshake. however, over the years

    a woman will offer a hand to shake, but in a very feminine way. the women who
    do offer a hand tend to be middle-aged or professional women who are accustomed
    to formality. older and young women usually do not offer to shake hands. once
    i asked a woman why she chose not to, and she replied, "it''s a guy thing." some
    women roll their eyes and grudgingly give me a light handshake, apparently just
    to appease me. recently, however, i greeted a woman by just saying, "hello, i''m
    pleased to meet you." to my surprise, she offered her hand, so i shook it with
    medium firmness. she said, "come on, give me a real shake." since i have been

    so first, but how do i know whether to shake a lady''s hand firmly or lightly?

    after baby jessica mcclure was rescued, america joined midland, texas, in celebrating
    the rescuers and those who provided the equipment, the expertise and the countless
    hours of effort. we celebrated the selfless acts of an entire community that pulled
    together for one child. the worldwide recognition our community received was extraordinary.
    at the time nothing existed to officially recognize communities for achievements
    such as these, so our community decided to create a platform to share the recognition
    we had received. we asked you to help us find deserving recipients for our midland
    community spirit award -- and did you ever! hundreds of nominations poured in
    -- 480 the last time you helped us. we continue to be amazed and invigorated by
    the incredible accomplishments of wonderful people and wonderful communities who
    achieve so much by working together. to date, the midland community spirit award
    has honored the achievements of: sioux city, iowa, for its compassionate community
    response in the wake of a tragic dc-10 crash; yakima, wash., for ridding neighborhoods
    of drugs; bangor, maine, for the volunteers who personally welcomed more than

    worked together over the christmas holidays to convert a civic center into a school
    after their elementary school was destroyed by fire; and petaluma, calif., for

    i''ve been married six years, and just learned that my husband recently had an
    affair. the night he confessed, he called the other woman, allowing me to listen
    to their conversation, and told her it was over between them. she asked him to
    call again, but he said no, and i believe that was the end of it. my problem is:
    how do i get over this? i asked him why he had the affair, and he insists that
    it was his fault; that i wasn''t the problem. but i believe problems in a marriage
    are a two-way street. he says we just weren''t talking enough and he thought i
    didn''t love him anymore. i tell him every day, and always have, that i love him,
    so i think there''s more. he lets me wake him up at any time to cry, and he''ll
    talk to me for hours. but i''m afraid he''ll grow tired of my pain. i have a friend
    who helps me talk this out, but it''s my husband i need to cry on and be held
    by. i don''t want him to keep apologizing -- he''s done that -- i just want comfort.

    i have always been close to my aunt. she''s my father''s sister and is in her
    early 40s. she''s perky, gregarious, charming and very pretty. she''s single and
    insists that she is happy that way. i''m not convinced. in the last two years,
    she has dated three men -- one was married, one engaged and one was recently divorced.
    initially, all three seemed to genuinely care for her, but after a few weeks,
    they reunited with their former mates. it would be one thing if aunty could say,
    "good riddance," and get on with her life, but this is not the case. she visits
    the workplaces of their former mates, hoping for an opportunity to drop the bomb
    that the guys are philandering. she also calls and pages these men at work, then
    makes excuses to us why they never call her back. abby, she even drives by their
    homes and businesses repeatedly. i''m beginning to dread her visits, and the tales
    of her activities embarrass me. there is no reason for a woman with her looks
    and personality to get mixed up with attached men, and carry on like this when
    they no longer want to see her. when family members comment on her behavior, she
    gets defensive and angry, but nothing changes. abby, is there any way to get her

    in january 1983, my wife and i sailed on the queen elizabeth ii from fort lauderdale,
    fla., to san francisco. we were in the middle of a bon voyage party when a young
    man around 30 peeked into our stateroom. he was a visitor on board, and asked
    if he could see what a cabin looked like. i invited him in, and we chatted for
    a few minutes. as he was leaving, he asked me to do him a favor and purchase four
    qeii world cruise t-shirts for his children. (the ship''s shops were closed while
    we were in port, and he would have to disembark before they opened.) he told me
    what sizes to buy and gave me $30 to cover the cost of the shirts, plus mailing.
    he gave me a business card -- he worked for a financial organization in fort lauderdale.
    "how do you know i won''t just keep the money and not send the t-shirts?" i asked.
    he said he had faith in people''s honesty. to make a long story short, i lost
    his card, so i couldn''t send him the t-shirts. when we arrived in san francisco,
    i got a fort lauderdale telephone directory and made over two dozen calls to different
    financial companies, but i couldn''t locate the young man. my wife has been nagging
    me all these years to write to you because we still have the t-shirts. you could
    put my mind at ease and restore a young man''s trust in people by printing my
    letter. and if you do, i hope he sees it. -- eugene gazzolo, auburn, calif.'

    don''t like to talk about the ''touchy-feely'' stuff." well, it''s not that teachers
    don''t like to talk about it, but oftentimes they can''t talk about it. i am a

    i have a terrible problem on my hands and desperately need your advice. several
    years ago, after enduring a nightmare marriage for 27 years, i left my husband
    "joe," with the loving support of a dear friend i''ll call "sally." i found a
    kindred spirit in this funny, gentle, intelligent woman -- and without her i don''t
    know how i could have survived that terrible time in my life. we were virtually
    inseparable. i had my own room in her home, and she had her own room in mine.
    we took trips together, spent weekends and holidays together, took care of each
    other and each other''s kids. we did everything together, and i must admit i''ve
    never been happier. we were always there for each other. but after three years
    of trying to make it without a husband, i caved in and remarried joe. he promised
    to change, and he''s been quite tolerable. the problem i''m faced with is that
    i no longer have a place in my life for sally. i just don''t have any time for
    her. she does not fit in with my "married crowd." she''s a single mom, and even
    though i love her dearly, she''s quite eccentric and my husband does not approve

    financially to the reception. i offered to pay for the drinks, and he and his
    fiancee seemed appreciative. the bride''s parents are divorced, but they, too,
    have each contributed several thousand dollars to the reception. a few days before
    the wedding, my son informed me that the total cost of the beverage bill came
    to nearly $3,000. i wrote a check for that amount. my son''s bride told my wife
    that there would be some extra charges, so i telephoned the accountant at the
    hotel to get the exact amount. the accountant informed me that there were no extra
    charges, and the total bar bill was less than half the amount i had contributed.
    my son refused to discuss the matter, so i sent the invoice from the hotel to
    him and his wife two weeks ago. since then, there has been total silence on their
    end, and it looks like a cold relationship is developing. my wife says i should

    i have been married for 18 years and have three children. last spring, my husband
    moved out to "find himself" and promised he would be back. well, he found a lady
    "friend" with whom he''s been spending a lot of time, drinking and partying. he
    never did this before. when he went camping alone with this woman, it was more
    than i could take. he said nothing happened. i didn''t believe him and filed for
    divorce. he has nothing to do with me now, and not much to do with the kids. i
    know it''s probably over, and i''m having a hard time accepting it. i have very
    little self-esteem. do you think i should try to get him back or accept the situation
    and get on with my life? he has changed so much that i don''t really like him
    anymore, but i want to do the right thing for the kids'' sake. he refuses to give
    up this woman -- she even comes before the kids. abby, what do you think? -- hurting

    this is for "paying the price in phoenix," the woman who was arrested for dui:
    the reason you were locked in jail like a common criminal is because you were
    a common criminal. it makes no difference whether you are a "professional" or
    not. astute officers also arrest doctors, ministers, judges and the like. be grateful
    you lost your license for only 30 days, and you didn''t kill anyone! the money
    you had to pay as a result of your drunken actions is only money. you are alive!
    get over your parents being disgusted with you. would they have their daughter
    d.o.a. instead of dui? the stress you are experiencing will pass, once you get
    on with the business of living. mine did. i also called my arresting officers

    my wife and i just celebrated our 10th anniversary. our problem is that most people

    quietly because we were short of money. when we had enough saved up to have the
    wedding we wanted, we got "married" again, and didn''t mention the first one.
    we felt that if people knew we were already husband and wife, they wouldn''t view
    our ceremony and reception as special and might not attend. we didn''t really
    lie. we just never discussed our quiet marriage ceremony, and no one ever asked

    it''s just that we''d both greatly benefit from it, and we get along great --

    because many people from all walks of life read your column, it''s the best way
    to make parents aware of something they may unintentionally be doing to their
    children. let me explain: recently i was standing in a store when i saw a young
    boy, who appeared to be about 10 years old, with his mother and a young girl.
    the mother said something to the boy, and he failed to respond correctly. then
    she yelled at him, "are you stupid or dumb or both?" it was evident that the child
    was embarrassed. abby, i know exactly how he felt. when i was young, my mother
    never missed a chance to tell me how dumb, stupid or unattractive i was. although
    she told me often how much she loved me, she undermined my self-esteem with her
    cruel remarks. i know she doesn''t recall making such remarks, but here i am 50
    years old and those words are still ringing in my ears. to this day, i am reluctant
    to attempt anything new or different for fear i will look stupid. i have been
    to a fine counselor who has helped me deal with this, and i have a wonderful family
    of my own now who encourage me and assure me i can succeed at anything i want.
    i do not wish ill upon my mother, but i feel very little for her and have no desire
    to share my life with her. my point is: parents should stop and think before saying
    things to their children that can traumatize them for life. the words may not
    cause physical harm, but they hurt nevertheless. -- still hurting in richmond,

    if you have more room for the subject of male menopause, may i contribute my 2
    cents'' worth? i was married for 20 years to a man who, although kind and generous
    in most respects, suffered from this syndrome for at least 60 of his recently
    concluded 87 years. at 16, he married an older woman, and married the fourth one
    at almost 70 years of age. three of these ladies are still living, as his wives
    were progressively younger. he was single only a matter of days between wives,
    and cheated on all of them. so, i contend that the age span for male menopause
    be extended from puberty until death. at the same time, strange as it may seem,
    he was very generous to them all and never even slightly abusive. interestingly,
    none of them put up a fight against his behavior. of the symptoms you list (courtesy
    of dr. blackman), only one really applied to my former husband -- reduced libido.
    he seemed to need the challenge of the chase to keep functioning. -- wham bam,

    buckle your seat belts by the georgia paramedics against drunk drivers (submitted
    by lucille groat) do you know what happens in the first fatal second after a car
    going 55 miles per hour hits a solid object? 1. in the first tenth of the second,
    the front bumper and grill collapse. 2. the second tenth finds the hood crumbling,
    rising and striking the windshield as the spinning rear wheels lift from the ground.
    simultaneously, fenders begin wrapping themselves around the solid object. although
    the car''s frame has been halted, the rest of the car is still going 55 miles
    an hour. instinct causes the driver to stiffen his legs against the crash, and
    they snap at the knee joint. 3. during the third tenth of the second, the steering
    wheel starts to disintegrate and the steering column aims for the driver''s chest.
    4. the fourth tenth of the second finds two feet of the car''s front end wrecked,
    while the rear end still moves at 35 miles per hour. the driver''s body is still
    traveling at 55 miles per hour. 5. in the fifth tenth of the second, the driver
    is impaled on the steering column and blood rushes into his lungs. 6. the sixth
    tenth of the second, the impact has built up to the point that the driver''s feet
    are ripped out of tightly laced shoes. the brake pedal breaks off. the car frame
    buckles in the middle. the driver''s head smashes into the windshield as the rear
    wheels, still spinning, fall back to earth. 7. in the seventh tenth of the second,
    hinges rip loose, doors fly open and the seats break free, striking the driver
    from behind. 8. the seat striking the driver does not bother him because he is
    already dead. the last three-tenths of the second mean nothing to the driver.'

    may i share with you what my 17-year-old stepson, brandon mccoy, has done on his
    birthday since he was 11 years old? he has a party and invites many friends. he
    asks them to design a card or write a funny poem for him instead of buying a commercial
    card. he also asks them to bring cans of food instead of gifts. friends deposit
    a sack of food as they enter the party, and no one sees who brought how much or
    what -- they just see a sack. after the party, brandon calls the food bank to
    come and pick up the "loot." what inspired brandon was seeing a man begging for
    food outside a fast-food place. he took the man inside and bought him a meal,

    i was pregnant, i realized that john had lied to me about everything, so i broke
    up with him. bill and i are back together now, and getting married soon. since
    he will be raising the child, he wants his name on the birth certificate instead

    i have read your column most of my life, and more often than not i agree with
    your advice. however, when i read your response to "wondering in minnesota" about
    whether or not protestants should kneel when participating in a catholic celebration,
    i totally disagreed. you assert that it is not necessary for a protestant to kneel
    when catholics do. abby, i recently visited the holy land, and had the opportunity
    to enter many houses of worship and other holy places. men (jewish, christian,
    moslem) are required to cover their heads with a yarmulke when entering the confines
    of the western/wailing wall in jerusalem, so i did likewise. at the entrance to
    the mosque al-aksa, jerusalem''s dome of the rock, all are required to remove
    their shoes, so i removed my shoes. did i wear a yarmulke or remove my shoes because
    i believed in, agreed with or understood the religious reasons for these practices?
    no. i observed these traditions to show my respect while in the spiritual homes
    of my jewish or moslem brothers and sisters. not kneeling in catholic services
    could be seen as a lack of respect to our specific approach to the universal god
    and the religious traditions of our people. although most catholics would never
    put someone out of a church for not kneeling, failure to kneel may send the wrong
    message. remember, "when in rome, do as the romans do." -- father r. tony ricard,

    this is a response to your answer to carol rushing of omaha, in which you said
    there should be a law restricting the use of cell phones while driving. your knee-jerk
    reaction harms all of our freedoms. perhaps you will next suggest we pass laws
    that state: -- no tuning the radio while driving. -- no looking at your passenger
    during conversation while driving. -- no adjusting the temperature while driving.
    -- no driving without eight hours of sleep. i could go on and on. we''ll always
    have tragic accidents no matter how many laws you try to pass. this potential
    loss of freedom is much more tragic. the marketplace can address these issues
    without requiring more laws. for example, the radio and heat controls could be
    located on the steering wheel for ease of use while driving. and there''s no reason
    the cell phone can''t be integrated into the car to allow hands-free use. remember
    the cb radio? truck drivers have used them for more than 20 years while driving.

    your suggestion of a law requiring people to pull over to use car phones is a
    good one. i have read that statistically, talking on the phone while driving is
    as dangerous as drunk driving. why isn''t this publicized more? my husband commutes,
    and amost daily must act fast to dodge drivers who are talking on their cell phones
    while zooming along at 85 mph and darting in and out of freeway traffic. i think
    phoning and driving should be as illegal as drinking and driving. how about a
    campaign, abby, with slogans and posters: "it was the last call he ever made,"
    or, "there are no phones in coffins," or a picture of a mom in a hospital bed,

    she would always sing a lullaby to them. one night, i heard her 6-year-old say,

    my father-in-law, "bert," and his wife of 10 years, "mary," will be coming to
    town for a family reunion. my husband wants to invite them to stay with us. i''m
    reluctant to extend the invitation for a number of reasons. after the birth of
    our last child, we no longer have a spare room. the other reasons are emotional.
    when bert and mary moved across country nine years ago, they would return every
    year for a 10- to 14-day visit. they always stayed in our guest room. their last
    visit was three years ago, while i was pregnant with our youngest. mary actually
    told me she thought i was too old to be having another child. during their visits,
    i had to endure much criticism of my child-rearing skills from mary, who is childless.
    they''d invite their friends and family to our home for dinners and barbecues
    that my husband and i had to provide. when our baby arrived, there was no acknowledgment
    from them. my husband didn''t even get a phone call from them acknowledging his
    40th birthday. i send them cards for every holiday and flowers at christmas. i
    also send them pictures of the kids, which they never mention when we call. bert
    is always mentioning all his stocks and bonds, so i know they can afford a motel
    room. however, my husband thinks the "right" thing to do would be to invite them
    to stay in our home. i would much prefer inviting them for dinners and spending
    some time with them, and avoiding the stress of their staying with us. what do
    you think, abby? -- frustrated in california'

    column. take a few minutes to think about what you have to be thankful for. how''s
    your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived this long. a lot of people
    haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands -- maybe millions -- are hurting more. (have
    you ever visited a veterans hospital? or a rehabilitation clinic for crippled
    children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear the birds sing,
    use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast table and read
    the newspaper, praise the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook?
    thin? well, most of the world is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food
    stamps. no social security. in fact, one-third of the people in the world will
    go to bed hungry tonight. are you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one.
    if nobody calls you, call someone. go out of your way to do something nice for
    somebody. it''s a sure cure for the blues. are you concerned about your country''s
    future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern -- concern for fair
    play under the law. your country may not be a rose garden, but it also is not
    a patch of weeds. freedom rings! look and listen. you can still worship at the
    church of your choice, cast a secret ballot, and even criticize your government
    without fearing a knock on the head or a knock on the door at midnight. and if
    you want to live under a different system, you are free to go. there are no walls
    or fences -- nothing to keep you here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving
    prayer; perhaps you will want to use it at your table today: oh, heavenly father,
    we thank thee for food and remember the hungry. we thank thee for friends and
    remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember the enslaved.
    may these remembrances stir us to service, that thy gifts to us may be used for

    for mother and child. he and i fight a lot because of his involvement with his
    ex-wife and ex-mistress. we have never spent a major holiday together because
    his adult children have all the family dinners, and i am not "family." i share
    my home, cabin, family, friends and vacations with him. yet he thinks he "owes"
    the holidays and birthdays to his family. last year we planned to have his birthday
    party at his house. we invited his children, but not the ex-wife, ex-mistress
    or child. well, no one showed up. they all blamed me for the exclusion. i''m fairly
    intelligent and own my own business. deep down, i want to get rid of him, but
    like the old rhyme says, "when it''s good, it''s very, very good -- and when it''s
    bad, it''s horrid." by the way, he recently went on a cruise with his ex-wife,

    that it''s "family." well, i am sick of this sick family. he says he would take
    me to family events, but the children don''t want me. he says he doesn''t want
    to hurt them any more than he already has, because the affair that produced the
    child lasted for 12 years of his marriage. he argues that as long as we spend
    weekdays together he should be able to spend the dozen-or-so birthdays and holidays
    with them. i think i should be included in family events or at least considered.

    her worldly possessions to me, her only daughter. i have three older brothers.
    we are very close and i intend to share mother''s things with them and their wives.
    we have never bickered over material things. three weeks after mother''s death,
    mary and her husband, "john," visited my father at home. over coffee, mary asked
    dad if he would return a piece of jewelry that she had given to mom. dad replied,
    "of course, take anything you need," meaning anything of mary''s. i hadn''t even
    sorted mom''s clothes and jewelry yet. mary helped herself to two necklaces, four
    pairs of earrings, a wristwatch and my mother''s birthstone ring. she had even
    helped herself to a pair of earrings that mom and i had made together in a jewelry
    class. she hadn''t given any of those items to mother. mary also reorganized all
    the jewelry and moved it from one drawer to another. i was livid. however, i politely
    told mary she could keep whatever she had given mom, but she should please return
    the other items. (how could she think she came before her friend''s children?)
    now, mary is pouting. she acts like i''m a spoiled, selfish person because i made
    her return the items. abby, this "friend" would cry while mom was sick, and say
    she couldn''t deal with seeing her when she was in the hospital. she cried loudest
    and hardest at mother''s funeral. i don''t understand her insensitivity. should

    a few months ago, i did something that i consider "standing up for the little
    guy." my husband thinks what i did was out of line. here''s the story: mom and
    i went shopping at a mall where there happens to be only one public telephone.
    we needed to use it, so we waited patiently in line for about five minutes. it
    appeared that the caller was bored and just "chewing the fat" with a friend to
    pass the time. mom left the mall to find another phone, but i stayed in line to
    indicate that i needed to make a call. after a few more minutes, the man turned
    to me and told me he''d be on the phone for another 15 minutes or so. i told him
    that he should not tie up a public phone that long. he grunted and continued his
    phone conversation. i moved out of sight and enlisted the help of six high school
    boys. they distracted him while i reached around and clicked down the receiver
    button to cut off his call. then i ran. abby, i am 30 years old and had never
    done anything like that before, but i was proud of myself for standing up to someone
    i considered an arrogant jerk. was i out of line? -- one for the little guys'

    i am a freshman at michigan state. when i was home for labor day, i came across
    your column. in it was a letter from a student in anaheim, calif. i read it and
    instantly felt as though somebody knew how i felt. i feel so all alone. i knew
    that college life entailed kegger parties and plenty of beer, but you have no
    idea to what extent until you experience it firsthand. every night at about 9:30,
    my entire floor gets their cue. they call friends and go to the frat house. i
    have been asked to join them a number of times, but have no desire to go. i make
    up lousy excuses every night. my roommate comes back anywhere from 3:30 to 5:30
    a.m. last time she told me she had had around 13 beers! abby, getting drunk is
    not my kind of entertainment. while intoxicated, anything can happen, from a car
    accident to aids. why are people so stupid? i am 18 years old and allowed to drink
    while on vacations, at weddings and things like that. why would i want to kill
    myself or get in trouble with the law when i''m at college to better my future,
    not end it? i thank "grieving and alone" for her letter. i have it taped to the
    front of my journal and read it at least once a day to remind myself what life
    is all about. thank you, abby, and thanks to all the people who still believe
    that there are some teen-agers who don''t drink or do drugs. -- alcohol-free in

    was sent to oakland on business and decided to bring jill with him. they asked
    to come to our apartment since they were in the area. i was scared out of my wits.
    however, among the gifts i received at my kitchen shower before my wedding were
    your two cookbooklets. i needed something that i, a novice at cooking, could prepare.
    abby, i chose my entire menu from your "more favorite recipes." your tomato salad
    because it could be made the night before; your sour cream chicken because i could
    assemble it early in the morning to cook just before their arrival, and the heavenly
    peanut butter pie. while i made the salad on friday night, rick made the pie.
    he also helped me with the chicken recipe on saturday morning. i''m happy to report
    that dinner was a great success. my in-laws were impressed. in fact, jill said,
    "you''ve been hiding something from me -- i had no idea you were such a talented

    way -- by preserving their old letters! andy carroll is the founder of the legacy
    project, an all-volunteer, national effort that promotes a greater appreciation
    for letters and the art of letter-writing. all of andy''s letters were destroyed
    when his house burned down years ago, and he knows firsthand how important it
    is to save old letters before they''re lost or damaged. he is also the editor
    of a book titled "letters of a nation: a collection of extraordinary american
    letters" (kodansha america), which was recently published. andy is now working
    with the veterans administration, museums and archives around the country to encourage
    americans to search through their homes for historically significant war letters.
    these may include eyewitness accounts of battles or acts of heroism, encounters
    with famous military leaders, love letters, or any other irreplaceable messages
    or little-known stories that will offer historians and future generations a better
    understanding of those who served and sacrificed for our country. the letters
    can be some you''ve personally written or received, or letters written by a relative
    from any war in which americans were involved. (remember grandpa''s old war letters
    in the attic? they may offer profound insight into the life of a soldier.) the
    legacy project will direct all potentially significant letters to respected museums
    and archives, which -- with your permission -- will then preserve them for posterity.
    if you prefer to keep your letters, the legacy project will send you information
    on safeguarding them. the legacy project is not looking for money. it is funded
    by proceeds from andy''s book. if you believe you have a historically significant

    i must respond to the letter from "troubled grandma," who was appalled at her
    7-year-old granddaughter''s revealing bathing suit. lest you think grandma is
    hopelessly old-fashioned, my daughter is 9 (i am 30), and i think some of the
    clothes marketed for girls are pretty shocking. last summer, the style was teeny
    little tops that exposed the navel and had spaghetti straps, worn with bell-bottom
    hip-hugger jeans. the skirts this year are minis and the shoes are chunky with
    platforms. my daughter plays with another 9-year-old whose mother bought her huge
    platform shoes for the summer. every time the girls would run out to play on the
    swing set, this girl''s ankle would turn and she would fall off her shoes! i told
    my daughter not even to think of wearing stuff like that. i used to work the night
    shift for a courier service. my "run" took me into manhattan between the hours
    of 1 and 3 a.m. (my husband, who was my fiance at the time, was beside himself

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am an emergency physician. over the years, i have come to know many police officers,
    firefighters and paramedics who put their lives on the line daily for the good
    of our society. i have great admiration for them. they don''t make millions for
    hitting home runs, but their work is vital to our communities. unfortunately,
    death in the line of duty is inevitable for a significant number of them, and
    consequently, every year hundreds of their children are orphaned. we have all
    seen pictures of funerals with an honor guard of dozens or even hundreds of the
    hero''s comrades in attendance. a collection is taken; speeches are made. but
    what then? the surviving parent is left with a child or children to raise alone.
    sometimes the youngest child is still in the mother''s womb, never to see its
    father''s face. a moment of silence to honor the dead is well and good, but there
    are years to go before the children reach maturity. i think it would be most helpful
    to have several camps in our country where these children could spend a couple
    of weeks each summer, gratis. the benefits would be many: each year, these children
    would spend time with others who have had the same experience. friendships would
    be created, and they could help each other face their loss and emerge victorious
    from their adversity. the ongoing nature of the camp experience would be a permanent
    tribute to the memories of those who gave their "last, full measure." this would
    teach those children that our society is truly grateful for their parents'' sacrifices.
    they would grow up with even greater admiration for their deceased parent, and
    thus greater self-esteem. the surviving parents would be given two weeks a year
    of much-needed time to themselves. they would also become part of a surviving
    parents network that would inevitably develop. finally, the men and women of our
    nation who put their lives on the line would know that, if the worst happened,
    their children and spouses would not be forgotten the day after the funeral. surely
    there is land, public or private, that could be designated for this purpose. i
    am sure there would be no shortage of volunteers to help run these camps. abby,
    i can''t think of anyone who would be more influential in promoting this idea
    than you. if you think it''s worth mentioning in your column, i''m sure the response
    will be as overwhelming as it will be heartwarming. -- phillip a. brewer, m.d.,

    may i respond to "saddened mother," who wants to give her son a portion of his
    inheritance now because he and his family need it? i think she''s right. perhaps
    my letter will help convince her husband. my father''s attitude about inheritance
    was always, "i''m going to spend my children''s inheritance." that was fine with
    my brother and me because we love our parents and wanted to see them happy and
    prosperous. they earned their money and we never asked for anything. however,
    a year ago, my father died unexpectedly. my mother decided to give my brother
    and me equal amounts of money she said she "would never miss." because of her
    generosity, i was able to quit my job and stay at home with my two young children.
    my brother used his windfall to enlarge his home to accommodate his growing family.
    my mother''s life is richer for the pleasure she receives from watching us live
    better lives. she''s glad she did it, and we are forever grateful, although we
    did not expect it. sometimes "the principle of the thing" can get in the way of
    what''s really important in life. losing my father made us realize that money
    isn''t all-important; we, her children, are the most important part of mom''s
    life. i don''t know if i can ever thank my mother enough for a gift that has helped
    me at a time i would never be able to recapture. i am blessed that she understood
    how much more her help would mean to us as young, struggling families than it
    would later in life. i hope "saddened mother''s" husband comes to the same understanding.

    i read with great interest the column in which a young man asked whether or not
    to marry his girlfriend of another religious faith. i met my husband more than
    15 years ago. i am christian; he is jewish. ours was a similar situation, and
    friends and relatives from both of our families advised us not to marry -- arguing,
    "what would the children be raised?" the christians wanted my husband to convert,
    and the jews were upset that he was marrying out of the jewish faith. my husband
    finally got fed up and told everyone to mind their own business because we were
    27 years old and could decide for ourselves in a country that grants everyone
    religious freedom. today we''re happily married and the parents of three wonderful
    children who celebrate and respect both religions. they pray all the time and
    have a deep respect for god. in the meantime, many of our friends and relatives
    who married within their faiths have divorced, and some of them do not have children
    with whom to share their faith. furthermore, some of them have stopped attending
    worship services at all. one relative recently told me that our children cannot
    respect two religions. i told her firmly, "you have to get over this issue. the
    children have a jewish dad and a christian mom. they do respect both religions,
    and they could probably teach you something about tolerance." perhaps john (the
    apostle) put it best: "love is from god; everyone who loves is born of god and
    knows god." (i john 4:7). i hope the couple go ahead and follow their hearts,
    and i send my best wishes for happiness to them. -- diana k. rubin, piscataway,

    herein lies the problem: all four parents have become increasingly hostile toward

    for everything and everyone but us." we call them at least twice a week, entertain
    them for all family events and see them often, but they''re still dissatisfied.
    they want us to be available (as a family of five) at least once a week for them
    to "drop by," for us to "drop by" their homes, plus a sit-down meal with them
    on sundays at our home. our repeated requests for them to spend time with us by
    attending one of the children''s sporting events have been ignored. i speak for
    my husband and children when i state that we are at our wit''s end with the arguments,

    i think you were way off base in your response to the lady who asked whether she
    should let her mother-in-law read the letter on computer disk that her father-in-law
    left to his 2 1/2-year-old granddaughter. if the man intended the letter to be
    read by everybody and his brother, he wouldn''t have addressed it to his granddaughter.
    in my opinion, this has nothing to do with "bringing peace to a grieving widow,"
    but rather with a domineering woman sticking her nose where it should not be.
    just because the letter is on a computer disk doesn''t mean it''s any less a letter
    than if it were written on paper and sealed in an envelope. by advocating allowing
    the mother-in-law to read that letter, you''re also advocating denying that little
    girl her right to a precious gift given to her by her grandfather out of love
    because he knew he wouldn''t be there to watch her grow up. i''m just curious
    -- do you also advocate opening and rewrapping children''s gifts before they receive
    them just to make some adult "feel better" about knowing what''s in them? remember
    that even the youngest members of our society deserve our respect, and one of
    the aspects of that is to respect their property. -- a reader who disagrees'

    poor hygiene. this is particularly difficult in a bank such as ours, where professional
    working relationships sometimes involve working in close proximity. the human
    resources director has discussed the problem with ethel. also, during the annual
    personnel evaluations, the boss made brief, but firm, comments that she must practice
    better hygiene. however, her efforts were short-term. abby, we cannot fire ethel.
    she''s a longtime employee with tremendous amounts of knowledge and experience,
    but it has reached the point that some of our younger staff have threatened to
    quit if ethel doesn''t clean up to "normal" standards. is there a solution that
    won''t offend her or make her defensive? -- staying downwind in iowa'

    i have been engaged to "bill" for two years. he''s a wonderful man, and i have
    always gotten along well with his family -- until now. we allowed his sister (i''ll
    call her denise) to store a few things in our basement until she moved. a few
    days ago, bill and i visited her new apartment, and i was shocked to see on her
    wall an expensive painting of mine that i had stored in my basement! i refrained
    from saying anything while we were there, but on the way home i mentioned the
    painting. bill said that denise had owned that painting for years. i didn''t force
    the issue, but when i checked my basement, my painting was missing. abby, my grandmother''s
    china was also missing. i don''t want to jeopardize my relationship with bill
    because of what denise has done, but the painting is valuable and the china is
    my only link to my deceased grandmother. i also wonder if the other items i have
    missed over the months have found their way into her sticky fingers. i can''t
    sleep for thinking about this. if i don''t do something about this, i''ll be restless
    and angry. but if i confront denise, i may lose bill. what do i do now, abby?

    what''s wrong with me? i met "mike" when i was 40. we dated exclusively for two
    years. when his mother had a stroke, mike moved an hour away to care for her,
    and i made the round-trip drive seven days a week to help. i emptied bedpans,
    redressed bedsores, cooked, cleaned and maintained a perky attitude to cheer up
    an otherwise dismal household. i did all this while holding down a job 40 hours
    a week. i did it because she was mike''s mother, and i loved him. mike promised
    eternal fidelity and said we''d have a wonderful life together when his mother
    passed on. after a year of this grueling schedule, i received a short note from
    mike that said, "mom and i thank you for all you have done for us. i''ve decided
    to start dating marianne, a cashier where i work. i''ve never loved anybody, although
    i''ve used the word often. goodbye and good luck." i called, thinking i deserved
    an explanation, but mike didn''t return my call. i wouldn''t take him back in
    a million years. so why, abby, do i still miss him, and why do i cry daily over
    losing him? wouldn''t any sane woman realize she''d been used and never shed a

    i would like to respond to "wants to be a grandma in l.a." she had no grandchildren
    and wanted to ask her son and his wife when they were going to start a family.
    my husband and i have three grown children in their 40s, and we also have no grandchildren,
    so i understand her feelings. i have some suggestions for her: 1. concentrate
    on how fortunate you are to have children, and consider how sad your son and daughter-in-law
    must be to be unable to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term. 2. learn about
    infertility. there are many good books on the subject, and if you learn more about
    the testing, various procedures for aiding conception, the emotional turmoil of
    infertility and the physical difficulties of conception, you''ll come to understand
    what your son and his wife are experiencing. 3. do not mention adoption to them.
    if they really want children, they''ll have already considered it. 4. if you want
    a good relationship with your son and daughter-in-law, never discuss wanting grandchildren
    unless they bring it up and ask your opinion. 5. stop dwelling on yourself and
    your fantasies. find something useful to do that involves children. many schools
    are crying out for volunteers to help a few hours a week. 6. if you and your husband
    are so desperate to have youngsters in your life, why don''t you consider adopting?

    almost a year ago, you published a reader''s letter that dramatically spoke to
    the issues that face battered women: "how do i protect my children and myself
    while i live with my abuser?" the reader signed herself "living a nightmare,"
    and her story, though heart-wrenching, was not unlike thousands of other women''s
    in our nation. you provided a great service to her, not only with your answer
    that began, "there is always hope," but also by addressing her need to protect
    herself. you then offered her, and thousands of others who live in a similar situation,
    a resource, our booklet, "striving to be ... violence free: how to create a safety
    plan." because of that letter, perspectives received more than 10,000 requests
    from as far away as guam, the far corners of canada and even puerto rico. we also
    received hundreds of heartwarming letters from women and men who were living with
    abuse (or knew someone who was) and were grateful for the help. amazingly, abby,
    we never received one complaint. october is national domestic violence awareness
    month. i can''t think of a more appropriate time to acknowledge your contribution
    in assisting women, men and children in their desire to live a violence-free life.
    you should take pride in the fact that you were one of the first to recognize
    that family violence is a societal problem -- one you were not afraid to address
    no matter how much heat you took in exposing it. for decades you have been the
    voice for victims who were too afraid to speak for themselves. and you have become
    the conscience for communities who looked the other way by saying, "it''s a family
    problem." you are to be commended for your compassion, advocacy and understanding
    of this very complicated issue. on behalf of the thousands of women and men who
    received our booklet, and those who struggle with the horror of domestic violence,
    i thank you. -- jeannie seeley-smith, executive director, perspectives inc., st.

    locate and pay for a personal assistant, so he now has some respite from his wife''s
    care. -- erika didn''t want her disability to keep her from being self-sufficient
    and supporting her son. she completed wcil''s computer training program and now
    works full-time at kaiser permanente medical center. -- juan g.''s motorized wheelchair
    broke down just two weeks after he had become employed. wcil helped him obtain
    $500 in emergency funding so he could quickly return to work. -- anita v. has
    multiple disabilities and is dependent on disability benefits to survive. when
    she was threatened with the loss of this funding, wcil helped her get through
    the bureaucratic maze and resolve her problem. -- steve s. was struggling with

    "i feel like i''ve been given back my life." -- loraine b. came to wcil seeking
    counseling to learn to live with her disability, and also received help in learning
    how to resolve some problems she was having with her housing providers. thank
    you, abby, for once again publicizing our "please call police" banner project.

    i recently received two invitations that rubbed me the wrong way. perhaps, in
    spite of my young age (26), i''m old-fashioned, but i think they were tacky. the
    first was from a coworker who is getting married. the invitation was for a paper
    shower. i assumed that meant the guests should bring paper for games or other
    activities. just to be sure, i called the bride-to-be to find out exactly what
    to bring. boy, was i shocked! she told me she wanted only money or gift certificates.
    i was so put off i didn''t attend or send a gift. the other invitation was to
    a baby shower for a friend of a friend whom i barely know. i''m a fun-loving person
    and planned to attend until i read the invitation carefully. the shower was being
    held at an expensive restaurant, and the invitation said, "no host lunch." abby,
    i got the impression that i was to bring a gift, pay for my own lunch, then leave.
    i didn''t attend that shower either; however, i did send a gift for which i never
    received a thank-you or acknowledgment. i have been the honoree of both a bridal
    and baby shower. the bridal shower was traditional with food, cake, games and
    close friends with whom i enjoy spending time. the baby shower was a luncheon,
    but my hostesses and i picked up the tab. i hope my guests never felt as pressured
    or insulted as i did when i received the invitations i have described. abby, am

    i must respond to "want my privacy in phoenix," the woman who didn''t want her
    picture taken at family gatherings. my sister was one of those who hated having
    her picture taken. she said she didn''t photograph well. she died suddenly in
    a car accident nearly 11 years ago. in the scramble to put together a memorial
    service, the only recent picture of her we could find was a 2-year-old polaroid.
    now, all these years later, all i have of my sister is a scant handful of photos,
    most of them taken before she turned 20. i am the photo historian in my family.
    i also teach people how to preserve their photos in safe scrapbooks. many of my
    customers also hate to have their pictures taken. i used to feel the same way.
    i am a plus-size woman who doesn''t look in a lot of mirrors. when i saw an occasional
    photo of myself, it was always a shock. did i really look like that? i guess i
    figured if no one took the pictures, i would "look" better. one day i realized
    that i may see myself only occasionally, but my family and friends see me looking
    like this every day, and they love me anyway. i now make sure that at least one
    photo is taken of me at every family gathering. "want my privacy" may have more
    of a vanity problem than a privacy issue. i hope she will stop depriving her family
    and friends the privilege of remembering her in a realistic way after she is gone.

    son''s services to help her (he''s very good at this sort of thing). for my sake,
    my son agreed, and we all settled on 11 a.m. my son and i drove to "sarah''s"
    and arrived at 10:55 a.m. no one was home. we decided to wait. at 11:15, sarah
    drove up. she offered no explanation for being late. my son assembled the piece,
    sarah thanked him, and we left. a couple of weeks later, sarah called and invited
    us to lunch as a thank-you for my son''s work. lunch was to be at 11:30. we arrived
    at 11:25 and, guess what? no one was home! we waited in the car. at 11:40, i wrote
    a note, "did you forget you invited us?" i left it on her door and we drove home.
    when we arrived back home, there was a nasty message on my answering machine.
    sarah yelled at us for leaving and called us rude. when she called a second time,
    i told her i expected a hostess to open the door when i was invited and had arrived.
    she replied that we were early and could not expect anyone to be home when we
    arrived early. she said she had just run to the bank. i pointed out that the bank
    is open until 6 p.m. and she could have gone after we had lunch. she said maybe
    it is ok to be early where i come from, but not in this country. abby, i was not
    born here, but i have lived in america for 50 years. i thought i was brought up
    with good manners, and nobody has ever said my "old country" ways are strange.
    am i missing something? -- surprised sonja'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    most of us know that people 65 years of age and older need a "flu" (influenza)
    shot every year. soon we will see lines of senior citizens waiting to get their
    flu shots at grocery stores, banks and community centers. many more seniors will
    go to their own private doctor to get protection against the influenza virus that
    kills an average of 20,000 people every year in the united states. but where are
    the young people? millions of people under 65 have certain medical conditions
    for which flu shots are strongly recommended. please, abby, urge your younger
    readers, including your pregnant readers, to read on and get ready to roll up
    their sleeves, too! flu shots are now recommended every fall for pregnant women
    who will be beyond the first trimester of pregnancy (14 weeks) during influenza
    season. flu shots are also strongly recommended for people of any age who have
    medical problems such as heart or lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, asthma,
    weak immune systems, and for those who live with or provide care for these individuals.
    nursing home residents should get flu shots, too, and most do. flu shots can be
    given to any person (6 months of age or older) who wants to reduce the likelihood
    of becoming ill with influenza this season. while your readers are requesting
    their flu shots, they should also ask their physicians if they need a "pneumococcal
    shot." pneumococcal disease kills up to 40,000 people each year in the united
    states. a one-time pneumococcal shot is recommended for everyone 65 and older,
    yet fewer than one-third of these adults have been vaccinated against this disease.
    this vaccine, like influenza vaccine, is also recommended for many younger people
    who have certain medical conditions. abby, please tell your readers the best time
    to get their flu shots is in october or november. and let''s hope that this year''s
    potential victims of influenza and pneumococcal disease will roll up their sleeves
    and get the vaccines that can save their lives! -- deborah l. wexler, m.d., executive
    director, immunization action coalition, st. paul, minn.'

    when are you going to get through your thick head the proper status of a tip?
    by contract law, a tip is a gift, although tax laws make it an exception to the
    exception. to request or expect a tip is nothing more nor less than mooching.
    payment of an adequate wage is the responsibility of management and not of the
    customer. we should patronize establishments that proudly display a sign "our

    you told "right or wrong" that the left side is the correct side to display a

    i am the divorced father of a 7-year-old daughter. i''ll call her gloria. i have
    custody of gloria every thursday and every other weekend, but it''s not often
    enough. however, "lois," her mother, will not agree to give us more time together.

    them that gloria is getting too little of her mother''s attention. abby, my daughter
    cries constantly and begs to spend more time with me. we have a great relationship

    and my second wife is due to deliver our first child in a few weeks. i think the
    new baby about to join our family may have upset gloria. perhaps that''s the reason
    for her tears. i worry that my beautiful daughter will become a problem child
    in need of therapy. a few days ago, before i dropped gloria off at school, i mentioned
    that i had a "tummyache." she worried about me all day, terrified that i would
    die. when lois picked her up after school, the teacher told her that gloria was
    crying because of me, so lois called and screamed at me for upsetting gloria.
    i spoke to my daughter on the phone and calmed her a little bit, but she was still
    worried. i suggested again to lois that gloria be allowed to spend more time in
    my home, but lois screamed, "it''s too disruptive!" she''s extremely stubborn
    when it comes to gloria and will not listen to a word i say. abby, i''d give my
    life to save gloria''s, and now i ask myself why i didn''t remain in my marriage,

    i have never written for advice before, but this really bugs me: a friend and
    neighbor of ours borrowed a very expensive gardening tool and broke a part on
    it. my husband, "walter," and i have always believed that when you break something
    you have borrowed, you repair it, get it repaired or replace it. our neighbor
    brought the tool back and told walter what had happened, but made no offer to
    pay for the repairs. so far, walter has spent more than an hour on the phone trying
    to get information on repairs and parts. he''ll have to travel at least an hour

    $40. when walter approached our neighbor about the problem, the guy responded,

    is afraid that if he presses the issue, he''ll lose this friend. abby, i''m married

    my father was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and given less than six
    months to live. with my wife''s blessings, i am staying at my parents'' home on
    weekdays to assist as much as possible with his care. i do this following a 12-hour
    night shift, so the time i can devote to actually talking with my father and doing
    everything he needs done is limited. much of my time is taken up with bathing
    him, helping him into his wheelchair and tending to his personal needs -- and
    of course, i must sleep a little. my eldest stepson asked to visit my father,
    and i told him that i prefer no visitors at this time (my father sleeps most of
    the time). dad will not see anyone unless he''s dressed and in his wheelchair,
    because he doesn''t want anyone to feel sorry for him. it is time-consuming to
    prepare him for visitors. my wife is upset with me for not allowing my stepson
    to visit. if the boy were close to my father, it would be different, but he hasn''t
    seen dad more than six times in the last four years. abby, am i being unreasonable

    you recently ran a letter from "widow x" that contained some valuable advice to
    the elderly who had to move in with their adult children upon the death of a spouse.
    may i please add to her wonderful list of self-cautionary words? -- don''t assume
    that you''re included in every social event or invitation your child and in-law
    receive. when you are included, accept cheerfully if you wish to attend. however,
    if the invitation does not specifically include you, don''t pout and complain.
    -- if your child and spouse plan a vacation, don''t whine if you''re not included.
    remember when you and your own spouse were able to take vacations; recall how
    nice it was to get away alone. give them the same opportunity. -- nurture grandchildren,
    but don''t interfere in their discipline. do not create discord between children
    and parents. if you have a valuable insight to offer regarding child-rearing,
    share it during a private moment with your adult child. -- under no circumstances
    should you pry into drawers, bills, personal papers, mail, etc. refrain from asking
    the price of a purchase, i.e., new home, vehicle, furniture or appliance. if they
    want you to know, they''ll tell you. -- remember, they have offered you a place
    to live. although it is now your home, too, respect the fact they are the head
    of this household. you had your turn in that position. now let them enjoy theirs!

    last winter, my sister and brother-in-law informed me they were coming for a 17-day
    visit. i live in a small cottage with a roommate, whom they have never met. my
    brother-in-law made reservations at a nearby condominium, which my sister promptly
    cancelled because it was more than she wanted to spend. (she has always stayed
    with me for free.) i didn''t ask if they could afford this vacation, and i told
    them i could help by building an extra room on the cottage for $600, which would
    save them $1,100. they sent the $600 and construction started. my roommate''s
    brothers worked day and night to finish it in one week. i had just gotten home
    from major surgery on another island, and it couldn''t have been more inconvenient
    for me to have company. however, i suffered in silence. from the minute she arrived,
    my sister acted like i owed her something. her demeanor embarrassed me and her
    holier-than-thou attitude was inappropriate. i had to work most of the time they
    were here because i was financially strapped from losing work due to my illness.
    they had access to my cottage on the beach, tv, stereo, new bed, telephone, etc.,
    but nothing seemed to please her. before she left i told her to stop telling me
    what to do, which she denied doing and got her husband involved in our discussion.

    about a year ago, a tragedy occurred in my life. i was engaged to be married to
    a man i had loved since the day i met him. it was six weeks before the wedding,
    and my dress had finally arrived. i was so excited. i eagerly rushed two hours
    to my parents'' home to have it fitted. it was mother''s day weekend, so i spent
    the weekend with my mother. when i returned home, i found a letter from my fiance
    stating that he was gone and would not be back. he said he loved me and would
    give anything if he thought our relationship could work, but he was certain it
    wouldn''t. that was all i got. i never heard from him again. he moved out of state,
    and no one -- including his parents, who had told me they loved me -- would have
    anything to do with me, or give me any clue as to why he left the way he did.
    they wouldn''t even return my calls. i love him with all my heart and would still
    marry him today. i''m trying to go on with my life, but i''m having trouble dating
    and wonder if i''ll ever be able to love again. will the way i feel about him
    ever change? am i crazy? i''ve tried to explain to my family that i knew someone

    i met my husband in church where he had recently been "saved." while we were dating,
    i found out he had come from a nonreligious, alcoholic home, but he told me how
    much he wanted to be a better husband and father than his father had been. the
    first few years i actually believed him when he said i had spiritual problems
    and was not submissive enough. i eventually realized it was his way of justifying
    emotional abuse toward me. over the years, he has become more and more distrustful
    and critical. everything is black and white to him. despite the fact that he says
    "no church i know of is worth going to," i have continued to raise the children
    in church. i refuse to allow them to become isolated and insist they participate
    in activities that interest them. i make sure they are around families who are
    good relationship models. i secretly went to counseling for a while. i have a
    lot of prayer support. why am i writing? because i''ve known a number of women
    over the years who have found themselves in similar or even worse situations.
    they married a man from an alcoholic or abusive background who had a "religious
    experience." in every case, including mine, the man swept her off her feet and
    was in a big rush to marry. no matter how much in love a woman is, if a man comes
    from a troubled background, she should be very careful. some men truly change,
    but many slip back into patterns that are familiar to them, and then the wife
    and family become the targets of his anger and pain. what i would have seen during
    a long engagement was that my husband swings between being the greatest guy in
    the world to being angry, depressed and controlling. it''s not true that only
    women from troubled families will be attracted to such men. abby, please don''t
    try to contact me, as i save "rocking the boat" for important issues, like those
    affecting the children. i just want to help others avoid what i have experienced.
    if i had known at the beginning what i know now, i''d have had a greater chance
    to get my husband into counseling, and we might have a better marriage than we
    have now. -- frustrated, but coping'

    why do so many mothers dress their little girls like adults? when my granddaughter,

    i read your column daily, but never thought i''d write to you. now i need an objective
    opinion, because my family is on the verge of a meltdown. almost three years ago,
    i allowed my sister-in-law (the wife of my half-brother) to take over my cellular
    phone account. she ran up charges of nearly $750, then refused to pay the bill,
    so i had to pay it. i have been trying to get her to pay me back since that time,
    and although she has told several members of the family that she''ll pay me, she
    has not. after all this time, i have come to believe that she will never pay me
    unless she is forced to, so i have filed a suit against her in small claims court.
    now my family is angry with me. they say i should have just let the money go.
    i say that''s wrong, and she should not get away with it just because she''s family.
    please advise me, abby. was i wrong to pursue this matter in court? -- torn in

    how can you get through to an 87-year-old father who thinks he knows everything?
    you can''t imagine how difficult it is to live with someone who "knows everything"
    and is wrong 90 percent of the time. "papa luke" has lived with my husband and
    me for the last eight years. when i had the opportunity to purchase separate but
    equal living arrangements, i foolishly ignored my initial instincts. he is a very
    controlling person. he has to be involved and have a say in everything that goes
    on in my house. people outside the family think papa luke is terrific, but they
    don''t witness the intimidation, the controlling and the tantrums this family
    must deal with almost on a daily basis. i find myself having to lie to him when
    i want to go shopping or visit my children, because if he hears the plans do not
    include him, he will fake illness so that i must alter my plans. sitting down
    and talking won''t solve the problem because he''s stubborn and doesn''t view
    himself as the family does. when i find the nerve to put my foot down and refuse
    to cater to him, he calls me selfish and throws a fit. i can''t plan anything
    social at the house because he takes over the planning and then the actual event.
    the grandchildren limit their visits because they don''t want to put up with him
    and they don''t see how i do. thanks for letting me vent, abby. can you provide

    a restaurant''s posted closing time means no additional customers after that time.

    stop what they''re doing and get out. if a person has been seated 15 minutes before

    i want to thank you for a letter i wrote you. no, i didn''t mail it, but writing
    the letter and sharing it with my family afterward helped me greatly. it forced
    me to organize my thoughts and get in touch with my feelings, and it opened up
    helpful, healing dialogue. may i suggest to your readers that they try this approach
    to whatever might be causing their sleepless nights? sending the letter is optional,
    but writing it can be essential in coming to terms with, and even solving, life''s

    my son, "steve," is 18 and will be going to junior college this fall. he will
    commute back and forth to school and has a part-time job that pays very little.
    steve is basically a good kid. he''s not into drugs or alcohol, but he is stubborn
    and bullheaded. whenever he needs gas money, clothes ironed or lunches made, i''m
    usually there to help out. however, when the shoe is on the other foot and i need
    help with chores and things around the house, he always manages to wiggle out
    of it, dump the task on his younger brother, or be "too busy" with his friends
    to stop and help me. when i try to talk to steve about it, he gets an attitude
    and ignores me, or walks away from me, then runs off to be with his friends. if
    my husband or i try to discuss this with him, he says now that he''s 18, he''s
    a man. abby, i am thoroughly disgusted with steve''s attitude. what should i do
    to get him to help around the house? -- tired mom in manito, ill.'

    i desperately need your advice about my soon-to-be mother-in-law. (i''ll call
    her kay.) she was a horrible mother to my fiance, "frank." he and his brother
    grew up with severe physical and emotional abuse. i believe kay must have a mental
    disorder that causes her to do these things. however, in recent years her behavior
    has improved. the verbal abuse isn''t constant like it was when frank and his
    brother were living with her, but its tone is as bad as ever. after kay cools
    off, she acts as if nothing ever happened. four months ago, frank got into a fight
    with his mother because we were five minutes late for a baby shower for "bobby,"
    our newborn son. the next day kay called and proceeded to tell frank how worthless
    he is, and that he''ll be a loser all his life. then she told him i was a thankless,
    fat slob. the last we heard from kay was a message she left on our answering machine
    at 3:30 a.m., saying she had ripped up bobby''s pictures and never wanted to see
    any of us again. abby, i was horrified. frank assured me that she would no longer
    be a part of our lives after having hurt us so badly. he said he was through tolerating
    his mother''s abuse. since then, kay has asked frank''s sister "arlene" to ask
    us to let her baby-sit and then arlene could take bobby to kay''s house. kay has
    also done many other sneaky things. abby, i have no room in my life for such a
    bitter, disagreeable woman who will only hurt our family if i let her back into
    our lives. our wedding is scheduled for november, and frank thinks we should send
    his mother an invitation because it''s the polite thing to do. i understand his
    attachment to his mother, but i''m terrified of her and what she may do. i don''t
    want her in our lives, and i''m afraid i''ll eventually lose frank because of
    my feelings about his mother. should i send kay an invitation to our wedding just
    to be polite, and hope she doesn''t show? or should i refuse to send one and hope
    frank understands? please hurry your advice, abby. the wedding is three months
    away and i''m getting ulcers. -- hurt bride-to-be'

    "steve" and i have been dating for about seven months. i''m head over heels in
    love with him. i knew the moment we met that he was for me -- and i think he feels
    the same way. i''m 28, he is 38, and we''re happy with each other. my question:
    how do i let go of my anger at his ex-wife? steve and "jolene" were married for
    one year and had a child together. i know jolene will be around for a lifetime;
    my problem is learning to deal with her. she''s hateful, self-centered and a user.
    she actually told steve she married him for his money, and only had his child
    to get more money out of him. steve has their 2-year-old daughter, "lynette,"
    every weekend. since mother''s day is on a sunday, she was with us. jolene didn''t
    ask to pick up lynette and spend mother''s day with her, but she did call to ask
    what lynette was getting her for mother''s day. on valentine''s day, she asked
    steve to send her roses from her daughter. she pulls this kind of stuff all the
    time, and it drives me crazy. jolene has a full-time nanny to care for lynette
    during the week, and steve takes care of his daughter every weekend. jolene has
    it made. it breaks my heart that jolene treats steve this way. he''s a kind, intelligent,
    gentle, wealthy man, but she manipulates him, and he doesn''t know how to say
    no to this woman. she berates him and tells him he''s a terrible father if he
    wants to spend time with me. abby, i know i have steve, and that should be all
    that matters. however, it angers me that there are people out there as coldhearted
    as jolene. she has a beautiful child, but she sees her daughter only as a way
    to pry more money out of steve. how should i deal with such a selfish, vindictive
    woman? -- sick of his ex-wife'

    what do you think of sending wedding invitations to every possible acquaintance?
    i know a gift is supposed to be voluntary, but during the last year i have received
    invitations from the daughters of casual friends or co-workers. i''ve met these
    daughters only once or twice in my entire life. they probably wouldn''t know me
    if they ran into me on the street. these invitations arrived with cards included
    that state where the bride is registered, or, in the case of the most recent,
    stating that contributions could be made to a honeymoon cruise with the check
    made payable to the cruise line! that one was for a wedding that''s three states
    away. the mother of the bride is fully aware that there''s no way i could attend
    the wedding. it''s obvious that a gift or contribution is expected when a card
    like that is included. because i either correspond with the mother of these brides
    or work with the father, it''s very awkward for me not to buy a gift for these
    events. yet i would never dream of sending them an invitation to my son''s wedding
    next year, because my son wouldn''t know them any better than their daughters

    about four years ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. the relationship didn''t
    end on a happy note. since then, she has gotten married and had a child. however,
    she continues to write to me two or three times a year. she always asks me how
    i am and if i''m seeing anyone. i think this is a bit odd. i had always thought
    that when people got married, they moved on and relegated their old relationships
    to the back of their memories. i always answer her letters very nicely, and i
    never ask why she continues to write. abby, now i''m wondering if you think she''s
    trying to keep me on the back burner. or do you think she just wants to be friends?

    i am 22 years old and the mother of a 3-year-old and a 10-month-old. i have a
    part-time job. my husband, "mike," was unemployed for six months, but he has finally
    gone back to work. abby, lately i have been feeling lazy. i want my house to be
    spic-and-span, but even though i know the work must be done, i''m not motivated.
    i''m tired of doing everything around the house. when mike was unemployed, he
    did the cooking, but he doesn''t do it anymore. i get up at 5 a.m., make mike''s
    breakfast, pack him a lunch, wake the kids, change their diapers, dress and feed
    them, prepare their bottles, brush their teeth and get them ready for day care.
    then i shower and dress. after that, i drive the kids to day care and mike to
    work. he has no driver''s license, so i am the family taxi driver. i''m so tired
    of driving and everything else. could this be what is making me feel so lazy?
    i was never like this before. i worry about the bills that haven''t been paid
    and credit card balances i can''t pay. mike seems to love to spend money on things
    he wants but does not need. he doesn''t put us first. he never asks if the kids
    need anything. he''s concerned only with himself. talking to mike doesn''t help.
    he just says, "don''t worry about it." i worry enough for both of us, and sometimes
    i find myself daydreaming about our having lots of money so that we would have
    no problems. abby, what can i do about my laziness and feeling so down? -- young

    is there a checklist of things to look for in a roommate? i need one. after years
    of living alone, i was forced by economics and safety concerns to share a house
    with a friend of two years'' standing. a kindergarten teacher who sings in the
    church choir and is devoted to her friends, "donna" appeared to be the perfect
    roommate. that is, until i moved in. donna is a slob! she never washes a dish,
    empties a wastebasket or takes out the garbage. she leaves her shoes in the living
    room, uses the dining room table as her desk -- littered with paper, bills, hairbrush
    -- and has converted the den into her personal parlor. it''s littered with dirty
    dishes and open food containers. we have one bath with a shower. dirty clothes
    and wet towels cover the floor or are left in the shower. in previous visits to
    her home, i''d always found it to be very neat. it turns out that her former roommate
    -- possibly as disgusted as i''ve become -- took it upon herself to clean up after
    donna. i have neither the time nor the patience. i''m looking for a new place

    i was recently in a relationship for eight months. it started when i was 22. my
    now ex-girlfriend (i''ll call her sue) was 18. abby, we fell in love quickly.
    i gave her my all. her family loved me and mine loved her. she said i treated
    her better than she had ever been treated. (i was raised that way.) i respected
    her, loved her and never mistreated her. in the fifth month of our relationship,
    i proposed. she accepted. sue recently went on vacation with some girlfriends.
    the vacation had been planned before we met. i didn''t object. i told her to go,
    and that i trusted her. well, she was gone for a week during which i never received
    even one phone call. when sue returned, i was at the airport with open arms. within
    24 hours of her return, she announced that she wanted to call it quits. she said
    she wanted her freedom, that she was too young to have her life planned. she swore
    she hadn''t cheated on me during her vacation. she told me she knows she''ll never
    find anyone who will treat her as well as i have. i was heartbroken. it''s been
    a month, and sue has gone "wild" since the vacation. a family member confided
    that sue had confessed to cheating on me during the vacation. abby, women used
    to complain that guys have no morals, treated them wrong and cheated on them.
    today, the roles are often reversed. women claim they want a guy who will treat
    them right, open the car door, bring flowers, etc. abby, that''s me! i don''t
    understand how sue could have claimed to love me and then been unfaithful. i have
    dated for the past eight years, and i''ve never been this much in love. i know
    the obvious response to this is that i''m young and have plenty of time; however,
    i must ask: where are all the "nice girls"? -- one of the last nice guys'

    scare by making him think i had been robbed while he was away. i sat in a kitchen

    i am the mother of three children, all under the age of 12. my problem concerns
    my in-laws, who are overly generous with the gifts they buy our children. i know
    of no one else who spends as much or buys as many gifts as my in-laws do on birthdays
    and christmas. my mother-in-law buys gifts for all three on each of the children''s
    birthdays so the other two "won''t feel bad." i never need to purchase clothes
    because they buy so many. i still buy gifts for the kids, but it''s simply overkill
    combined with what they receive from their grandparents. my children actually
    tire from opening gifts before they finish, and then they have difficulty remembering
    everything they received. don''t misunderstand; i''m very grateful, but i find
    their generosity almost absurd. i have asked them to cut back, but it only causes
    problems between us. my parents also find my in-laws'' generosity overblown. consequently,
    about three years ago, they stopped giving the children any gifts at all. when
    i asked my mother why, she told me she couldn''t compete with the other grandparents.
    abby, my parents are loving grandparents, but they don''t have the kind of money
    my in-laws do. my husband thinks my parents are terrible for not giving gifts.
    he insists it''s the thought that counts. my mother says why bother when the children
    are so overwhelmed they don''t know what gift came from which family member. so
    far, the children haven''t questioned why only one side of their family gives
    them gifts, but i know they will ask one day. i work hard to instill good values
    in our children, but i fear that they will grow up spoiled. how should i handle
    this? -- genuinely concerned'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    since travel season is upon us, i''d like to offer a suggestion as well as seek
    your advice. for the host and hostess who are having houseguests: please spend
    a night in your guestroom to judge its comfort level. we visit my in-laws in another
    state twice a year and stay in my husband''s childhood room. the sheets are so
    thin you can read a newspaper through them and the pillows are so musty it is
    difficult to breathe. the only light in the room is a tiny decorative child''s
    lamp, which does not cast enough light to tell what garments are in the closet,
    much less to read by. in addition, the closets are jammed with years of accumulation,
    making it difficult to find a place to put our clothes. it has been this way for
    years. when my in-laws stay in our home, i go out of my way to make them feel
    welcome. i always include small "extras" -- new magazines, an alarm clock, extra
    pillows, fresh soap, a couple of drinking glasses and even fresh flowers on the
    dresser. abby, i appreciate my in-laws'' hospitality and do not want to appear
    ungrateful, but it has reached the point where i dread staying in their home.
    it is not a matter of money for them or for my husband and me. i would gladly
    pay to "freshen" the room, if it could be done diplomatically. any suggestions?

    my mother had me when she was only 16. by the time i was 3, i also had a 2-year-old
    brother. my mom and dad split up and mom let dad take us to raise. dad was only
    24 and trying to raise two children on his own. my mom was very promiscuous. she
    had a total of four children -- none with the same father. she dumped the others
    on the fathers or the fathers'' families. my dad couldn''t handle raising my younger
    brother and me, so i was sent to live with my maternal grandparents. for some
    reason, my grandparents didn''t want my brother and me, so a family that dad knew
    adopted my brother. when i was 7, my mother''s sister got married, and then i
    was sent to live with her and her husband. my mother knew where i lived, but i
    only saw her occasionally -- once every couple of years. my father was always
    a part of my life, though. i spent almost every weekend with him. it wasn''t until
    i turned 17 that i found out that my dad wasn''t my biological father. he had
    met my mom while she was pregnant, and, because my biological father wanted nothing
    to do with my mom or me, my "dad" married her and gave me his last name and a
    lifetime of devotion. i almost lost my dad last year because of a cerebral aneurism.
    i love him with all my heart. however, i am also curious to know who my biological
    father is. should i ask my dad if he knows who my biological father is? or do
    you think it would hurt his feelings too much? if you think i should ask him,
    how should i go about it? anyone can father a child, but it takes a very special
    person to be a daddy. in my heart, my dad will always be my daddy -- now and forever.

    i desperately need some advice. i am a physician, married to a beautiful woman
    for 20 years, and we have three teen-age children. my wife and i are in our 40s.
    in 1995, my wife confessed she had a seven-year affair with my best friend. he
    would come to our house after i went to work and they would have sex in our bed.
    although my wife never showed me any affection during that period, i blamed it
    on the strain of raising three children, never suspecting her infidelity. she
    let word of the illicit affair slip when i teased her about her old boyfriends.
    i was devastated, but i didn''t let on. she apologized, and our marriage continued
    for the sake of the children. in the last two years, my wife has been especially
    loving and affectionate toward me. earlier this year, my married sister-in-law
    (i''ll call her marie) stayed with us for four months. she confided to me that
    she had an unsatisfactory sex life with her husband. one thing led to another,
    and we slept together several times. marie has since returned home. now i feel
    guilty and would like to confess this indiscretion to my wife to clear my conscience,
    but i am not sure how she''ll react. though it will even things out, i do not
    want to hurt my wife or expose marie''s behavior. should i tell my wife about

    the number of people who take the time to write a letter, address it, stamp it

    the lady who wrote complaining that restaurants don''t slice lemons the way she
    likes them for her iced tea flabbergasted me. maybe she should take a reality
    check. when someone or something starts getting on my nerves, i find that taking
    a moment to think about its importance in the grand scheme of things really helps.
    this may seem morbid, but i do so by imagining that i am on my deathbed. think
    about it: do i want to lie there and say, "i''ve had a wonderful life full of
    challenges, beauty and love," or do i want to say, "i should have worried more
    about that snotty salesperson, or the paperclip requisition form"? we can''t all
    be easygoing all the time -- and we shouldn''t be -- but the key is keeping things
    in their proper perspective. abby, the advice you gave the lemon-wedge lady was

    your reply to "outcast," who was good to his family, but was treated badly by
    them, was correct and true. my husband and i have had the same problems. we sacrificed
    and worked hard to be successful, but we paid the price. however, your second
    paragraph stating that perhaps the family will recognize themselves in your column
    and mend their ways won''t work, believe me. for years we were hurt and perplexed
    by unfair treatment by my husband''s family. we tried to talk about our feelings
    and were ignored, or else they would smile and say nothing. the problems began
    to escalate. we finally realized that the problem was family jealousy, and it
    was incurable. family jealousy and the pain it causes are the last dirty family
    secrets that should be exposed. after much consideration, we asked ourselves if
    we would be better off with or without family, and how it would affect our children.
    we decided we would be better off without them. so, without harsh words, and without
    any more energy devoted to "why are we ignored?" we purposely drifted away. it
    has been seven years since our last contact. our lives are better, and there are
    no more hurt feelings and anger. we allowed his family to have their shallow victory
    and moved on. we deliberately left no forwarding address when we moved. our children
    are now happily married. we spend our time in volunteer activities, enjoying our
    grandchildren and with many devoted friends. most important, we have each other.
    abby, there are some things that cannot be "fixed." my advice to "outcast" would
    be to get on with their lives. if they do not want to break off contact entirely,
    make the contact infrequent. in other words, take the "please kick me" sign off
    their rear ends. please discuss family jealousy in future columns. it is an ugly
    and destructive force that adversely affects children if not dealt with. that
    was our biggest worry as we began to understand why we were being mistreated.

    i''ve been dating this girl for a couple of months. when i first saw her, i liked
    her. when i got to know her, i fell for her. i wanted to spend every minute with
    her. we have so many things in common -- similar backgrounds, a love of books,
    authors and the theater. i like everything about her. the only concern i have
    about this relationship is that i can''t afford to pay for everything whenever
    we go out. even though she only works less than part time and i work full time,
    i''ll be broke soon with the way we''re going. i don''t want to ruin a potentially
    terrific relationship over money. what can i do? -- broke in san francisco'

    i have an 8-year-old son who was disagnosed with diabetes last year. a few months
    ago, i took him to a matinee at a theater. i took some dietetic sugar-free wafers
    and dietetic sugar-free chocolate candies with us. when the young lady at the
    ticket counter saw that my son was holding some food, she very loudly read the
    sign that was posted on the wall: "no outside food permitted." (as if i couldn''t
    read.) i was embarrassed and quite upset. i explained that my son has diabetes
    and she just repeated to me, "sorry, ma''am, no outside food permitted." i thought
    she was very rude. abby, couldn''t they bend the rules a little bit? my son can''t
    eat the candy they sell. i understand the rules about bringing in outside food

    you advised "feeling guilty in the desert" to allow her mother to live with her
    temporarily if the mother and father separate. well, let me tell you why that
    is not good advice. how do i know? i''m speaking from personal experience. i owned
    my own home and was still unmarried when i foolishly allowed my mother to live
    with me. she stuck like a leech and insulted every man i dated. i had to fight
    for every idea i wanted to implement in my own home. it was a miserable fight
    all the way. mom worked and was capable of having her own home, but she was terrified
    of living alone. finally, in desperation, i sent all her belongings to my brother''s
    home while she was visiting him. i caught hell from him and his family because
    they knew it wouldn''t work for our mother to live with them. she begged to come
    back to my home, saying it would be temporary, only until she could find a place
    of her own. i weakened and allowed her to return. she lived with me and made my
    life pure hell until the day she died. abby, please retract your advice to "feeling
    guilty." encourage her to stick to her guns and not allow her mother to take advantage
    of her. -- learned the hard way p.s. i married after mother died, not before.'

    my husband and i are having a major disagreement concerning our two sons'' inheritance.
    when we die, our sons will inherit everything 50-50, with the exception of our
    family business, which is worth a considerable amount of money. my husband has
    already turned the business over to our eldest son, "donald." my husband feels
    that donald has earned this because "he stayed with us." donald and his family
    have enjoyed a very prosperous life because of the family business. "steve," our
    younger son, started his own business in a different field. he has always struggled,
    and his family has never known the same level of comfort as donald''s. this troubles
    me. i am trying to convince my husband that we should give steve at least part
    of his inheritance while we are alive. he needs the money to enlarge his business.

    a member of our family recently graduated from college -- finally! this woman
    is in her late 40s. for the past four years, she has spent all her free time and
    money on studies when she should have been spending more time with her husband,
    children, grandchildren and ailing parents. she stopped socializing with friends
    and occasionally missed family parties because she had "work" to do. she often
    visited with callers at her door or on the porch because she put her studies before
    housekeeping and, boy, was it ever obvious! her house was an unholy mess. it''s
    a good thing her husband is a patient man -- otherwise, he would have booted her
    out and found a real wife. during her last year of school, she lost her 4.0 average
    when a family member became ill. she actually cried over it, even though her grades
    are never going to matter to anyone. now that she''s a college graduate, she seems
    hurt that no one has made any fuss about it. when she offered tickets to her graduation
    ceremony, there was a dead silence. her own kids didn''t even want to attend.
    i can understand making a fuss when young people graduate because they are at
    the beginning of their careers, but a degree in "the classics" won''t help this
    woman with the job she''s held for 25 years. she''s now nearing retirement age,
    so she doesn''t need a new career. abby, do you think we should have made a big

    the main course, he brought the fortune cookies and the bill and placed them on

    at the same time, another employee began vacuuming around us and the other couple

    i have carried this resentment for two years and would like to ask you if i am
    right or wrong to feel hurt and angry. on thanksgiving 1996, which was our 53rd
    anniversary, my wife and i invited our children and grandchildren and a few close
    friends to our home for dinner. we received many nice gifts from all. abby, the
    following day my wife passed away. it was completely unexpected. thank goodness
    all my family was here. one couple, whom my wife and i had known for many years,
    immediately asked me to return their gift. i was shocked, but of course i complied.
    my children were angry at me for giving in to their request. was i wrong to return
    their gift? please don''t identify me, as the couple lives nearby. -- still hurting

    i participate in a support group for families of teens in residential treatment.
    many of our teens are making new choices. among them is the choice of chastity

    teens are glowing and radiant in their newfound personal power. we are helping

    where in the "book of love" does it state that one partner in a relationship must
    embrace all of the interests of the other? if "gwen" doesn''t like hunting wild
    turkeys, her fiance should hunt the gobblers with his buddies who do. given gwen''s
    culinary abilities, she may derive far greater pleasure from roasting the bird
    than killing it. "turkeyless" states that gwen is good-looking and can cook. now
    there''s an unbeatable combination that should form the foundation for lasting

    this is in response to "hurt bride in texas," who was upset because her future
    sister-in-law "selfishly" became pregnant after agreeing to be a bridesmaid in
    her wedding. when i was planning my wedding, my 18-year-old sister tearfully announced
    that she was pregnant after we had already ordered the bridesmaid dresses. i,
    too, was upset, thinking, "how could she do this to me on my special day?" i hurt
    my sister when i asked another sister to step in for her. i will never forgive
    myself for being so self-centered and thinking the whole world revolved around
    my wedding. my adorable nephew was born a few months after my wedding and is now
    in college. i''m so proud of him, and of my sister who faced many challenges as
    a young single mother. a wedding day is just that -- one day. family is forever.

    our daughter is in her late 30s. she''s been married and divorced and has two
    sons. she is now living with a leech, a man who does not contribute to the household
    rent or food, and treats the boys like dirt. she provides for all his needs from
    her spousal support, while her kids walk around with holes in their shoes and
    unkempt clothing. when i was a child, my mother abandoned me. she gave me away
    to my aunt to raise. my aunt worked at menial jobs to keep me clothed and fed.
    my mother did not contribute to my upkeep. she left the town where we lived. my
    aunt saw to it that i graduated from high school. she could not send me to college,
    but she planted the education seed, and when i became self-sufficient, i went
    to college, worked and graduated. my aunt, god bless her soul, was the best mother
    until her death a few years ago. now i have been abandoned a second time, this
    time by my daughter. my wife and i discussed with her the living arrangment she
    now has, told her she should get rid of this leech and provide a more stable home
    for her boys. we''re not telling her not to have any friends or lovers, only not
    to let them live off her and mistreat her sons. based on your advice to others,
    as i recall, if i ask you what to do, you will tell me to leave her alone and

    this concerns "hurt brother in ohio," who has been given power of attorney by
    his mother. i would ask the brother who has the power of attorney to be broadminded
    in regard to his older, smarter (his words) and angry brother. i suspect a long-standing
    anger has affected the mother herself, and perhaps all her children. the angry
    brother may be silent, but i''ll bet he has a story to tell. if the mother is
    90, these brothers are not kids. both of these men have possibly spent years being
    compared to each other, and it has served neither of them well. it''s way too
    late for the mother to sort it out, if what i surmise contains a seed of truth.
    dutiful brother asked for a suggestion. i have one: would it be possible for the
    dutiful brother to force objectivity on the situation by hiring a service to handle
    the bill-paying and accounting? the service can send statement copies to any and
    all parties. the dutiful brother could then avoid further hostility by sincere
    refusal to regard the power of attorney as other than a formality that he need
    not act upon. -- a reader who has been there in denver'

    i''m 51 and never married. i''m not bad-looking, and i am not gay. i just got
    dumped by another girlfriend, which is nothing new. what turns women off are the

    home almost every day, especially on weekends. dad is dead and there are no other
    siblings, so i''m the one always on call. "mary," the lady who just called it
    quits, says mother is abusive to me because i have been trying to get her approval
    all my life and she never gives it. mother "almost" gives me kindness and love,
    but then she manages to say something ugly or belittling that devastates me. i
    slam the door and leave in a rage. then i go back and we repeat the same scenario.
    every time i go back, i think this time it will be different. mary said i act
    like a battered wife returning over and over to her abusive husband. she said
    i''m just as addicted to being abused as my mother is to abusing me. at first
    i was furious and refused to believe it, but now i''m getting scared that she''s
    right. i''ve been waiting for mother to die for the last 10 years. she is not

    the letter from "exhausted in tacoma," who was perturbed with her hospital roommate''s
    visitors, disturbs me. first she said how sick she had been at the hospital and
    how rude her roommate''s visitors were; then she was well enough to get up and
    go home. abby, just how sick was she? as a registered nurse with 30 years'' experience,
    i can tell you she doesn''t sound very sick to me. if she had been in the hospital
    as many times as she claimed, why did she go to the emergency room instead of
    having her own physician admit her? also, she should have known enough about hospital
    procedures to have the floor nurse quiet the visitors down. she should also have
    known to ask for another gown to cover her backside, or how to use a robe or sheet
    to drape around herself to go to the bathroom. i can''t be sure without all the
    facts, but i''m guessing that "exhausted" is a typical hypochondriac trying to
    get a few days in the hospital complete with "maid" service by her nurses, while
    her insurance pays for this "vacation." no one who is truly sick gets up and leaves
    for the reasons she gave. and if rest at home was better than what she could get
    in the hospital, why didn''t she just stay home in the first place? -- fred holt,

    my problem is, in recent months i''ve been taken advantage of more than once.
    some wealthy relatives insisted that i play the organ for their son''s wedding.
    when i offered to play as my gift, they insisted that if i didn''t accept payment,
    they wouldn''t let me play. the wedding came and went; everyone else received
    a thank-you note, but i haven''t received payment or a note of thanks. in another
    incident, a couple in my church who have a limited income decided to get married.
    since i''ve known them for quite some time, i offered to play at the wedding for
    free. to date, i have not received a thank-you note for this gift either. at the
    risk of appearing immodest, i am a very good musician, and the music at both weddings

    the range of $100 to $300 or more for a wedding. the issue i''m bringing up is
    not so much the money as the fact that the couples seem to have had so little
    appreciation for what they received. apparently my years of practice, experience
    and expertise are not worth their time to say "thank you." the very least the
    couples could do when they receive a gift is to send a note of appreciation. don''t

    i have been engaged to a wonderful man for more than two years, and cannot seem

    he works two jobs so we don''t go without anything. sounds perfect, right? the
    problem is, i don''t think i love him. i say that i do, but i don''t feel it in
    my heart. he is all a woman could ask for in a husband, but is that enough to
    replace love? or have i read too many romance novels? he wants to get married
    as soon as possible. i am 29, have never been married, and i feel my daughter
    needs a father. i am also afraid i won''t find a man who will ever love me as
    much as he does. can i find a man whom i love, who accepts my daughter as his

    please correct me if i am wrong, but i believe my cousin, "lenore," is the most
    selfish person i know. lenore is getting married in an evening ceremony and has
    decided to dis-invite our grandfather, pop-pop. pop-pop was so excited about attending,
    he bought a new suit and showed it off to everyone who visited him. pop-pop''s
    health is failing and he goes to bed early -- 8:00 p.m. the wedding is at 6:00
    p.m., and lenore and her mother (my aunt) have decided it would interrupt the
    "perfect wedding" if pop-pop were to leave early, so he has been told to stay
    home. this means grandmom will attend her first grandchild''s wedding alone. also,
    my grandparents will have to pay for a nurse to stay with pop-pop. many people
    have volunteered to take pop-pop home when he becomes tired, but my cousin and
    her mother say the decision has been made. what do you think, abby? isn''t it
    awful to exclude pop-pop just because he is old? -- appalled cousin'

    i never laughed so hard as i did when i read about "gwen" in the letter from "turkeyless
    in arkansas." i like that girl! i''m sure there are a lot of "hunting widows"
    out there who would love to have done the same thing (yell, "run, turkey, run!")
    my response to gwen: you can do one of two things if your man decides to confront
    you about your "insensitivity" to his hunting: 1. "run, gwen, run!" you will always
    be second to his hunting. it may be the turkey season now, but next on the list
    will be deer, bear, elk, moose, rabbit, squirrel, pheasant, duck, etc. if you
    should marry this guy, expect to wake up alone from late october to early april.
    so, if snuggling in the morning is what you like to do, get a teddy bear. don''t
    make any plans without asking his schedule because morning isn''t the only time
    they go hunting; late afternoons are popular, too. if dinners and movies are what
    you enjoy on saturday evenings, take a girlfriend instead. and be sure to keep
    his "if i go hunting one more time my wife is going to leave me ... god, i''m
    gonna miss her" t-shirt handy at all times. or, you could: 2. join him and have
    fun! that is what i finally did after four years of griping and nagging. when
    i did, i got the opening-day prize -- a 10-inch bearded gobbler! my husband and
    i have fun hunting together, although i don''t go all the time. it taught me to
    respect his favorite sport, his hunting buddies and him more! my suggestion to
    "turkeyless in arkansas" is: if you care enough about gwen, don''t try to force
    her to love what you do. has she considered ditching you because you break out
    in hives whenever she asks you to accompany her to the mall? if you dump her,
    watch out! your friend, who has a much better sense of humor than you, may snatch
    her up, and next year you''ll be hunting alone. -- talking turkey in florida'

    my wife, "stella," and i have just returned to the united states after having
    lived abroad for 15 years. she and i come from very different backgrounds. i have
    only one living relative. stella, on the other hand, comes from a large extended
    family of brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, assorted cousins and grandparents.
    family gatherings, especially around the holidays, are large, festive and noisy.
    here is my dilemma: i am asthmatic and allergic to cigarette smoke in any form,
    even on people''s clothing. needless to say, i try to avoid it as much as possible
    and don''t go out to eat very often, unless there is no smoking at all in the
    establishment. neither stella nor i smoke, nor do our sons. however, stella''s
    sister and her husband (as well as other family members) are heavy smokers. her
    sister''s daughter is also slightly asthmatic and has other respiratory problems.
    while i, as an adult, can avoid this smoke, the child can''t. my closest friends
    and associates know about my health concerns and are very considerate of me, and
    the ones who smoke refrain from doing so in my presence. the few times that we
    have visited my sister-in-law, everyone smokes around me. stella has mentioned
    my condition to her family many times, yet no one seems to care or understand
    how this affects my health. now i am faced with two choices -- avoiding these
    people and creating tension among my wife''s family, or jeopardizing my health.
    recently, stella''s family has been asking her why we have been avoiding them.
    how can we best handle this without hurting feelings and alienating family members?

    it may seem unfair for a fourth-grade boy to be shunned by the boys in his new
    neighborhood, but i see another course of action for his mother to take that might
    provide a possible solution. at this child''s age, it is important for his parents
    to become acquainted with his potential playmates and their parents. why not suggest
    to the mother who wrote you that the newcomer parents take the initiative and
    invite the neighbor boys to come to his home to play? i am the mother of five
    (now grown) children, who are less than seven years apart in age. after school,
    playtime at our home (or elsewhere) had rules and limits for the children''s safety
    and my sanity. shortly after moving to texas, our youngest, "betty," who was in
    the third grade, asked if she could accept an invitation to play at "donna''s"
    house. donna didn''t live in our immediate neighborhood and i didn''t know her
    parents, so i suggested that donna come to our home to play. i phoned her mother,
    who insisted that the girls play there. the invitations pingponged several times
    before both of us admitted that we were just cautious about unfamiliar households.
    i don''t remember who went to which house first, but donna and betty became good
    friends -- and my husband and i have enjoyed knowing donna''s family. the mother

    i am 72, and this is my first letter to you. i''ve been recalling memories and
    entering them in a family-tree program on our computer. the letter from the lady
    who shared the idea of putting a business card in a child''s pocket for id in
    case he or she got lost in a crowd brought back a good memory. we did the same
    thing in 1958 before our trip to the hudson''s department store in downtown detroit
    to see santa claus, and our son was instructed to show his father''s business
    card if he got lost and someone asked his name. we had forgotten about it until
    santa asked, "and what is your name, young man?" our 3-year-old son reached into
    his pocket and, without a word, handed the card to santa. santa just chortled
    and turned to all of us, "how do you like that! the kid carries his own business
    card!" so thank you, abby, and your reader for jogging this memory that is going

    this is in response to "confused in arizona," a man who has the courage to admit
    that he is a victim of domestic violence. this is more pervasive than people think.
    my personal saga began several years ago, when i went from one violent marriage
    into another. in my case, i filed charges and restraining orders against both
    violent individuals. at each point in the process, i have been subjected to ridicule
    and scorn. after all, only women are abused in this society, aren''t they? at
    one point, when i was in court on a domestic violence oomplaint against my wife,
    the judge, the defense attorney and the prosecutor all actually laughed out loud
    in open court at the idea that a man would file a domestic violence complaint.
    my wife got off, as you might expect. yes, i did end both relationships, but the
    damage has been severe. counseling for men is woefully unavailable. there is a
    cultural bias that only women are abused in this society. all of the literature
    available for domestic violence victims refers to "he," "him," etc. as the perpetrator
    of the crime. it''s no wonder we''re embarrassed to report it. hang in there,
    "confused." get out and find a safe place -- but realize that you won''t be believed,
    you will be laughed at, and there will be roadblocks at every crossroad in your
    recovery process. thanks for allowing me to vent, abby. we need outlets for our

    "brian" and i fell in love at first sight as teen-agers. we married very young,
    but he was the most wonderful, caring, loving man i''d ever known. he treated
    me like a queen. we moved far away from our hometown, and i was homesick. i didn''t
    give married life a chance. i acted like a baby instead of the married woman i
    was and returned to my parents. brian begged me to stay, but i refused to listen.
    i planned on going back to brian and our life together "sometime." besides, i
    was having fun being single and partying -- so when brian flew home to talk to
    me, i brushed him off. two months after that he moved in with a woman and filed
    for divorce. when i received the papers, i realized i''d made a mistake. i wrote
    brian a letter apologizing and begging for another chance. he never wrote back.
    that was 20 years ago. i have been married to "charlie" for 15 years. we had some
    good times together, but about three years ago we started drifting apart. neither
    of us cared enough to do anything about it -- and it''s to the point where we
    don''t even sleep in the same room anymore. it''s only a matter of time until
    we divorce. i''d be gone already, but i need to pay off some bills before i go.
    on a recent trip to my hometown, i ran into brian while i was shopping with my
    mother. i was stunned at the strength of the feelings running through me. my heart
    stopped and i was completely in love again. i could barely speak. my mother did
    all the talking. i feel like a love-struck teen-ager. brian is on my mind 24 hours
    a day. we never had a "last talk"; we never said goodbye. i recently ran into
    brian again. (yes, it was a planned "accident.") he was very nice. he''s not married,
    but he''s living with someone. i wrote him a long letter, apologizing for everything
    i did and thanking him for all he did for me. in it, i said if there''s ever a
    time he''d be willing to talk to me, i''d like to. i didn''t tell him i love him
    or want him back in my life, but the point comes across. i want him to know that
    if there ever could be a chance, i want it. should i give him the letter? please
    help me. tell me right from wrong. i have no one to talk to and nowhere to turn.
    -- in love with brian'

    my husband, our 6-year-old daughter (i''ll call her marcia), and i recently drove
    to my sister-in-law''s, several states away, for a visit. at dinner, i was introduced
    for the first time to her new boyfriend, "joe." the man was sloppily dressed and
    didn''t look very clean. after dinner, joe and several of the other male guests
    who had been drinking during dinner went out to continue drinking. marcia asked
    to spend the night at my sister-in-law''s, but i was reluctant to let her stay
    in a home where these men would be returning later, no telling how intoxicated.
    i was concerned for marcia''s safety and put up a fight. i got pretty ugly in
    front of her and my husband. marcia was crying and my husband was yelling. nobody
    cared to listen to my reasons for not wanting her to stay. abby, i grew up with
    an alcoholic father. he used to come home drunk and get very mean with my siblings
    and me. i didn''t want the same thing to happen to my little girl. marcia ended
    up staying there for the night, and joe did come back drunk. he finally passed
    out on a couch near my daughter''s bedroom. the next day, marcia said joe and
    my sister-in-law were talking loudly for hours after he returned, and she didn''t
    get much sleep. now my sister-in-law won''t speak to me, and my husband and mother-in-law

    "needed his space." we got back together, and then about a month after that he
    began to slowly slip away from me again. each week he would distance himself more,

    people come to you with every conceivable problem, so i''m encouraged to present
    one that''s so touchy i''ve never seen it mentioned in your column. how do you
    get people to wash their hands after using the bathroom? in our home, the bathroom
    is right off the kitchen, and when the water is turned on, it can be heard in
    the next room. guests have gone into our bathroom, used the toilet (i can hear
    the toilet being flushed), and then come out without having turned on the faucet,
    so i know they haven''t washed their hands. then after supper, they offer to help
    me dry the dishes! (i always say, "no, thank you!"). there''s no telling what
    kind of infection could be transferred to my dishes from those unwashed hands.
    worse yet, where i work there''s a cafeteria, and i''ve seen some cafeteria employees
    walk out of a bathroom stall and go straight out to serve the people without having
    washed their hands. some of them even wipe and dry the dishes as they come out
    of the dishwasher. can you imagine the disease risks a diner faces when he uses
    these "freshly washed" dishes? abby, please explain how dangerous this is. if
    you print this, i promise to frame it and hang it above our toilet. -- please

    everyone has heard about teen-age girls who think they''re fat when they''re not.

    attractive. parents and teachers try to tell girls that size doesn''t matter,
    but most teens think it does. magazines, television and even our peers recognize
    only thin people as being beautiful, so how can you blame girls for wanting to
    be thin? i''d like to give some advice, especially to other teen-agers. girls,
    if you are with someone who is heavier than you or uncomfortable with her body,
    don''t complain about your own. it will only make them feel worse. believe me,
    i should know -- i have been hurt many times by behavior like this. guys, let
    a girl know she doesn''t have to have a perfect body or look like a model for
    you to like her. one reason a lot of girls go on diets is so that guys will notice
    them. everyone: compliment others. make them feel loved, accepted and beautiful.

    i just finished reading your response to "confused about control." you may have
    overlooked a few key phrases in "confused''s" letter. this man has described warning
    signs of spousal abuse. his wife is definitely attempting to control him -- and
    the issue must be addressed quickly before the problem becomes intolerable. key
    to this conclusion: his wife, "anne," must approve his clothing purchases. abby,
    who is purchasing the clothing, and who will be wearing it? anne is not making
    suggestions; she throws hissy fits if he doesn''t go along with her. this is clearly
    intimidation, a major characteristic of spouse abuse, which is quite different
    from simply expressing dislike for some articles of clothing. she has already
    begun to complain about his eating habits, his cologne, his job and his bald spot.
    anne wants exclusive choice in what he wears, and more, and "confused" gives in
    to avoid his wife''s tantrums. next she will be dictating whom he can see, where
    and when he can go out, when he can use the telephone and whom he can call. this
    will include his family. and she''ll demand he tell her everything he says and
    does when they are not together. abby, please rethink your answer to this man
    and strongly suggest that he get some help before he becomes a prisoner in his

    this is in response to "anonymous, naturally," who complained about straggling
    shoppers who come in three minutes before closing time and expect to "shop the
    entire store." i encounter this situation at least once a week. i also work in
    a busy department store. we have a public address system like the one you suggested.
    at 8:45 p.m., we start announcing that the fitting room is closing, and then repeat
    the announcement every five minutes until 9 p.m. customers just keep walking through
    the store and continue shopping. when we remind them that the store is closed
    and offer to help them find an item, we get nasty, rude remarks or dirty looks.
    people complain about how rude clerks are in stores. well, maybe they should look
    at themselves. some of them are unbelievably insensitive. let them work one night
    in our shoes, picking up after their children, smiling while someone is in our
    face complaining that the lines are too long, or trying tactfully to let the customer
    know that the price tag they just switched to get a lower price is incorrect.
    i actually had a male customer tell me one night that he couldn''t believe i was
    smart enough to catch it! how do you get the message across to people like that,
    abby? i could go on and on, but why? most shoppers don''t really care. all we

    all my life, i''ve lived the way i was raised to live -- church every sunday,
    living those commitments during the week, and holding family and marriage above
    all else. i have waited on my husband hand and foot, taken excellent care of our
    family, done all of the housework and parenting (he was always too busy), and
    did nothing without first thinking how it would affect the family. after 25 years
    of my husband running around on me, i kicked him out. (my goal was to wait until
    the children were out on their own.) now, he has started the most malicious (and
    untrue) rumors about me. i''m sure it''s to cover up his escapades. people in
    this small town are having a heyday with the gossip. i can''t even go to the grocery
    store without someone making a snide remark or not speaking to me. i am crushed.
    for years i worked with every organization my children were involved in, held
    offices, cooked, baked, ran errands, raised money and supported all of their efforts.
    i came to know a lot of people this way -- and they came to know me. what happened
    to those friendships? why are people listening to the gossip and feeling sorry
    for him? his mother, sisters and brother have all had extramarital affairs, and
    it has been well known in this community. (his brother''s affair was plastered
    across the front page of the local newspaper as part of a murder trial.) why are
    people believing him now? please don''t tell me that time will fix everything.
    it''s been six months and the gossip is getting worse. obviously, i can''t sign
    my name or hometown -- i don''t want to even think about what gossip would result
    from it. my husband saw a psychologist and a psychiatrist for two years. they
    urged me to throw him out because they felt he was dangerous. i''ve talked with
    them both, and they tell me to just hang in there and ride it out. abby, that''s
    much easier said than done. please help me. i have talked with my husband''s ex-aunt
    at length. she tells me his uncle did the same things to her, and she feels the

    in the wedding party. she said there would be no problem and assured me that if
    she did start trying to get pregnant, her due date would not coincide with the

    be positive she wasn''t due in november. well, surprise, surprise! she is now
    pregnant and is due 10 days after the wedding. needless to say, my fiance and

    i am in a situation similar to the one described by "can''t forget in l.a.," whose
    parents lied about the date of their marriage. i recently learned that my family
    is caught up in the same scenario. my sister had told me she believed our family
    had a secret -- and she suspected it was our parents'' date of marriage. until
    then, i''d never questioned this, so without telling anyone, i did a little detective
    work. when i received a certified copy of my parents'' marriage license, it indicated
    that they were married nearly four months later than they had told us all these
    years. this means that my mother was pregnant when they married. my parents have
    had a long and happy marriage, so i was neither horrified nor "damaged" to learn
    that they, too, were somewhat less than perfect in their younger years. abby,
    should i tell them i know the truth? -- glad to know the truth'

    recently you printed a letter from "dorothy," who was pleased that people with
    unwanted babies bring them to a hospital or police station, rather than leaving
    them to die. that letter appeared in the sunday paper on april 5. on the same
    sunday, at 4:30 p.m., a newborn baby girl was found abandoned at the coffee lounge
    in front of the main doors of legacy emanuel hospital''s family birth center in
    portland, ore. i don''t know if this was a coincidence, but we had never heard
    of a baby being left at a hospital before. the infant immediately received the
    medical care she needed and is doing fine. we nurses loved taking care of her,
    and we named her star. more than 200 people called regarding adopting her. because
    of star, attention was called to hundreds of other children in need of homes.
    several of them have found homes! star presently is in a loving foster home, and
    if her mother doesn''t come forward, she''ll eventually be placed in an adoptive
    home -- making some family overjoyed, i''m sure. we don''t know the mother''s
    circumstances, or why she felt she needed to leave her child -- but we are so
    happy her mom left her in a safe place. wouldn''t this be wonderful to read about
    more often? i hope dorothy''s letter and this one will encourage mothers in dire
    circumstances to seek help, or to leave their babies where they''ll be taken care
    of. -- jennifer bissett, r.n., legacy emanuel hospital, portland, ore.'

    my wife and i have read your column for many years, and we have learned a lot
    from you. never did i think i would have to write to you for advice. abby, my
    28-year-old son, a medical student and a very bright young man, met a young woman
    about a year ago. both of our daughters like this young woman, and so do we. i
    mention this because of the many women our son has brought home who failed to
    hit it off well with our daughters. our son and this girl decided to get married
    in late march. invitations were mailed, plans were finalized, and everything seemed
    to be ok. seventy-two hours before the ceremony was supposed to take place, we
    were notified by our son that the wedding was canceled. despite this cancellation,
    we drove to see them in the city where the marriage was to take place. our son
    was distraught, as was his bride. he wanted to get married and then get counseling.
    (the counseling condition was made by her.) she insisted they get counseling first
    and then get married, if that was still feasible. she had her reasons -- he had
    his. our problem is, the wedding gifts from her friends, and our friends, had
    arrived. we expected that those gifts would be returned promptly, but neither
    she nor our son has shown any urgency. personally, we don''t care what she does
    with the gifts from her side of the family. but we are from the old school and
    cannot condone this behavior. both our daughters are telling us to stay out of
    it. as things stand, there is a possibility that they might marry later. what
    do you suggest? how do we act toward our friends? please help us clear up this
    mess and please don''t print our name or location. -- red-faced parents'

    i am writing in response to "upset in tennessee," who refuses to recognize her
    son''s "live-in" because the two are not married. i have a slightly different
    twist to the story. i am a gay man in my 40s and have been in two long-term relationships.
    the first was for 12 wonderful years and ended in 1990 when my partner died. when
    he and i visited my parents at the same time my brother and his live-in girlfriend
    did, my mother showed my brother and his girlfriend to separate bedrooms, but
    showed my partner and me to the same bedroom. my brother was upset and asked,
    "mother, why are you making us sleep in separate rooms and letting ''jim'' and
    ''doug'' share the same room?" mother responded: "if jim and doug could be married,
    they would be, so in my eyes, they are married. you, on the other hand, choose
    not to be married and therefore, under my roof, you will abide by my rules." abby,
    i wish the law and society were as wise and understanding as my parents. i agree
    that people who love each other and have a committed relationship should be married,
    and i wish i could marry the person i love and have lived with for six years.
    but until society can accept our love, i guess we will have to be without benefit
    of the "cheap piece of paper." as it stands, if he becomes ill and hospitalized,
    i may not even be allowed to visit him. thanks, abby, for hearing me out. i wish
    i could "make it legal." -- married in my heart'

    the homes in my neighborhood are very close together. last year a family moved
    in next door, and they have terrible fights. off and on throughout the summer,

    and painful things. winter weather and closed windows have brought some relief,

    abby, i know -- i''ve lived through situations like that. thankfully it was a

    hurting to say those awful things. i have two questions: if they start fighting
    again this year, is there an appropriate way of asking them to keep the volume
    down? and what, if anything, can i do for their children, who bear the brunt of
    all this yelling? i have never seen any evidence of physical abuse, but i know
    all too well the verbal abuse they are receiving can be just as damaging. i know
    that low-cost family counseling is available in this community. should i mention
    it to them? i don''t know them very well, and i''m hesitant to do anything that
    will make the situation worse. some people might consider an offer of information

    my boyfriend (i''ll call him timothy) was in special education classes all through
    school. he is very intelligent, but has a slight learning disability. because
    of the way the educational system was set up, he was put into classes with students
    who had severe learning disabilities. he wasn''t even taught addition and subtraction
    until his senior year. despite the odds against him, timothy enrolled in community
    college. the lowest-level college classes are a huge jump from his high school
    classes and too fast-paced for him. he has talked with the counselors and tutors,
    but no one can help him. he has put much time and effort into classes, but still
    has made only failing grades. he blames himself for this, although it isn''t his
    fault. it breaks my heart to see timothy''s self-esteem dashed and his ambitions
    crushed. he is terrified of what his future holds if he cannot get an education.

    our bridge group has been together for more than 30 years. our members have always
    been very supportive of each other. we do more than play cards; we socialize and
    travel together. in short, we''re good friends. for the last year or two, we''ve
    had a serious problem with one member of our group. she causes discord and irritates
    the rest of us. so far, we have avoided a direct confrontation with her. some
    of her annoying habits include constantly interrupting, repeating her own thoughts
    on what has just been said by others, complaining constantly about her neighbors
    and her health, loud belching, irritating loud laughter, keeping us waiting while
    she uses our phones without permission, and embarrassing behavior in public. i
    could go on and on, and her behavior is getting worse. we have tried to solve
    the problem by joking about it, mildly insulting her or just ignoring her. but
    it doesn''t seem to register, and she makes no effort to alter her behavior. aside
    from this, she is a very generous, good-natured individual, and we care about
    her. we feel she is "fragile," and several members of the group suspect she''s
    mentally ill. we''d like to salvage our relationship with her, but she''s pulling
    the group apart. we avoid getting together because of her. we must do something

    i''ve never written to you before, but i think you blew it in your answer to "in
    the middle in tucson." her sister was so upset about the "tacky gifts" her daughter
    had received from their brother and his new wife that she severed the relationship
    with her own brother. what is this world coming to when we are so shallow that
    we value gifts over our own flesh and blood? my advice to her would have been:
    "lady, wake up! tell your sister that life is too short to hold a grudge for something
    as trivial as what kind of a present someone gives." the wife may not have been
    deliberately rude; perhaps she was trying to be thrifty. the brother may not even
    realize where the gifts came from (most men have little to do with gift-buying);
    maybe their family finances aren''t in quite as good shape as she thinks they
    are. there could a lot of other "maybes" -- and the sister just doesn''t realize
    it. if something were to happen to her brother before she was able to make things
    right between the two of them, she would never forgive herself. if she doesn''t
    like the gifts her daughter received from this auntie and uncle, she should shut
    her mouth and give them to someone who could really use them -- or simply throw
    them away. but don''t destroy a relationship that is a god-given gift. abby, i
    don''t mean this letter to be a put-down to you, but your answer seemed to encourage
    the sister to drive that wedge in more firmly. family is far too precious to throw
    away because of something so meaningless. -- also a sister in north carolina'

    i must respond to the letter from "eileen drew, melbourne, fla.," whose husband
    wears a safety helmet while using his riding lawnmower. you took it a step further,
    saying roofers, pool men and all workers with any risk of head injury should wear
    helmets. all well and good, abby, but i think you should have gone even further.
    there are many hazards around the home and in recreational pursuits from which
    we all need protection. for example, take the shower: do you realize how many
    people are injured by falling while showering? i have taken to wearing a safety
    helmet while in the shower, just in case i should slip and fall. you may be wondering
    how i wash my hair. i''m in the process of solving that by hanging the harness
    of a wwi parachute from the shower ceiling. from this i will be suspended, in
    order to avoid falling while my helmet is removed for shampooing. i love to swim,
    but i fear that i may strike my head while diving, so i also wear a helmet while
    swimming. i get lots of funny looks, but that''s ok; i''m safe and those other
    guys are not! another hazard i''ve recently been made aware of is hitting my head
    on the nightstand should i fall out of bed at night. also, at my age, i have to
    get up frequently during the night to use the bathroom; what if i should trip
    and fall in the darkened room? to avoid these hazards, i wear my safety helmet
    to bed. i am currently working on an invention that will provide ultimate safety
    to everyone, everywhere, 24 hours a day: full body armor. the air-conditioning
    unit for summertime wear has me baffled right now, but i''ve resolved to keep
    working on it. in the meantime, next month when we go to hawaii, it is my intention
    to see to it that every person walking on waikiki beach wears a safety helmet.
    i know i''ll be wearing mine. -- norm totey, everett, wash.'

    i have never written to you before, but "josie," my daughter-in-law, does something
    that really bothers me. she frequently tells "sammy," her 3-year-old, to "shut
    up." that phrase seems so ugly. i am afraid it will undermine my grandson''s self-confidence.
    children should be made to feel they are important and loved, and that what they
    have to say is of interest to adults. they need to be supported. i also think
    josie should be more consistent with her discipline. how is sammy to know if mommy
    means it this time when last time she threatened but never acted on her words?

    i recently married a wonderful, unselfish man who was willing to take my last

    that his family had other sons to continue their family name; mine is a family
    of daughters. in order for him to assume my last name legally, we have been told
    he will have to go to court and request the name change. isn''t this discrimination?
    from the time a woman marries, she can begin signing her new last name without

    from time to time you print a letter about overcoming shyness. i would like to
    share some wonderful advice my mother gave me many years ago. as a teen-ager,
    i was desperately shy and dreaded school parties and dances. one day my mother
    said to me, "you know, dear, being shy is really being selfish. you are spending
    too much time thinking, ''what kind of impression am i making? am i saying the
    right thing? do i fit in?'' the next time you go to a party, instead of thinking
    about yourself, look for someone else who seems shy and make an effort to talk
    to that person." it worked. however, my life didn''t change overnight, and there
    are still times when i walk into a roomful of people and my heart pounds. but
    now instead of standing alone, i reach out to someone who is also alone. i''ve
    made some wonderful friends that way -- and i overcame my shyness. -- robin skone-palmer,

    my oldest daughter (i''ll call her "alexis") is being married this year. she is
    planning a very large, expensive, fairy-tale wedding. her father and i recently
    divorced after 29 years of marriage. i have told alexis and my ex-husband that
    i don''t have a lot of money for this occasion because the divorce wiped out most
    of my savings. my daughter claims she doesn''t want to hear it. i have offered
    to pay for her wedding gown. my ex insists that he expects me to pay for half
    the wedding, even if i have to take out a loan from him to do it. i have tried
    to be upfront, but no one is listening. i''m 50 years old and need to save toward
    my retirement. i can''t possibly afford to risk my entire future. also, we have
    two more daughters -- so it''s likely there will be more weddings in the future.
    please keep in mind that it won''t be possible for me to volunteer to pay for
    only "my" invited guests. almost everyone on the bride''s side will be mutual
    friends and family both of my ex and myself. give me some desperately needed advice

    the letter signed "examining life in ohio," from the woman who was married to
    a decent man but didn''t consider him her "soul mate," prompts this letter. i
    met my soul mate, and on our first date we both knew it. i figured it was the
    greatest love in the history of the world. i would have died for this man. we
    were the perfect match! we had our ups and downs, and his family threw barbs at
    me every chance they got, but i withstood it because i knew i had his love. so
    what happened? after 38 years, i finally admitted what i had been denying for
    decades (and he still denies): my husband is a more or less functioning alcoholic.
    he absolutely refuses help, and things are getting worse. the clues have been
    there for a long time. now i am envious of older couples enjoying their later
    years, while i live with a man who is dishonest and lies constantly. i cannot
    trust him. i dread holidays with our children and grandchildren. i''m embarrassed

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have just read with disgust a letter in your column from a clergyperson giving
    a specific time when the clergy should be paid for performing a marriage. the
    writer is concerned that if payment is not made preceding the ceremony, he/she
    will have to ask for payment at a later time. ministers in most churches receive
    a salary that should include the performance of any service done in the church.
    i cannot help but wonder what the tab would be for a baptism or a funeral. in
    my denomination, services such as those are considered sacraments of the church.
    to even think of charging for any of them is nothing short of blasphemy. certainly,
    i have received gifts from brides and grooms for performing their wedding ceremony,
    but to expect or to ask for payment is simply not acceptable. it is crassness
    such as this that gives the church and its ministers much bad press. do you suppose
    that this person sends statements proclaiming "service rendered" that carry a
    monthly service charge if not paid promptly? hopefully, this individual will remember
    that the role of a minister is primarily that of a servant. -- the rev. ralph

    why is there no place for people to safely leave unwanted children and babies?
    shouldn''t there be a law stating that a child left at a police station or hospital
    would be immediately available for adoption? abby, so many children need time,
    effort, prayer, money, and visible, vocal adults to help them. i''m referring
    to the many little ones who are abused, maimed, brutally tortured or left to die
    horribly alone every year. this happens often with unwanted, resented or hated
    children. the parents or other legal guardians feel there is no other way to get
    rid of them. the deaths are not always intentional, but the abuse is. the stories
    haunt me: a baby girl, unwanted by both parents, whose burned body was left in
    a garbage dump in the desert; a well-dressed baby pulled out of san francisco
    bay; a newborn infant left beside an infrequently traveled road; another baby
    left in bushes near a playground. and a mother who buckled her children into car
    seats and rolled the car into a lake! these are not predators who take children
    from their homes, out of yards or off the streets. they are mothers, fathers,
    or the lovers of the legal guardians who do these terrible things. what of the
    teen mother who can''t cope with being a child herself, let alone being a mother?
    the abusive father who can''t cope with his own life, let alone the demands of
    a child? the grandparents who, having raised their own children, find themselves
    in the twilight of their lives trying to raise a grandchild? these are people
    who don''t want to admit to themselves or to society at large that it''s easier,
    sometimes even a relief, to destroy the baby in their care. if parents or caregivers
    could leave these children at a "safe place" with no questions asked -- and no
    effort to prosecute them for abandonment -- perhaps fewer children would die.
    as it is now, law enforcement is compelled by law to track these people down.
    it''s left for strangers to grieve for these children. i know this letter is unprintable,
    but i just had to give vent to this. the burned baby left in the desert haunts
    me like no other. -- dorothy l. miller, pittsburg, calif.'

    they said the other sons "needed" what they were giving them, and my husband didn''t.
    since when do you not need love and acknowledgement from your parents? we are
    comfortable financially because we work hard and sacrifice. if we don''t have
    the money for something, we wait and save for it. i feel we are being punished
