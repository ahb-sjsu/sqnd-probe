    for several years a young woman (she''s now 29) has been coming to my home to
    trim my three poodles. she would drive to our place in the country after work,
    so i paid her very well, adding a generous tip. i always had a lovely dinner for
    her and she enjoyed being with my husband and me. i''m 68, but the age difference
    didn''t matter--we became good friends. i was invited to her bridal shower. at
    first i hesitated, knowing all her friends were younger women, but i finally accepted,
    took an expensive gift and had a wonderful time. then came her wedding invitation.
    written across the top--in her own hand --was: "fifty dollars minimum for the
    gift, please." i nearly had a stroke! i could not believe it. i studied it for
    a week, then wrote her a note saying that her suggestion of a $50 minimum for
    a gift was the maximum in poor taste, and i would not be attending her wedding.
    when she received my note, she called crying, "it was supposed to be a joke. i
    thought you had a better sense of humor!" then she hung up on me. a few days later
    she returned my shower gift by u.p.s., so i phoned her and told her i had given
    her that gift in good faith and was sending it back to her. i also said i had
    discussed her invitation with several friends who all agreed it was in terrible
    taste. am i old-fashioned, behind the times and lacking in a sense of humor? or
    have good taste and manners gone out of style? poodle lover.'

    i am the mother of four lovely daughters. the eldest is 11. i''ll call her agnes.

    the parents of my first husband take agnes for a month. their son was their only
    child, and agnes is their only grandchild. so far agnes has been to disneyland,
    hawaii, mexico and europe. my husband and i cannot afford to take our other three
    children on trips like that, and they are understandably envious and resentful.
    i''m sure with all the divorces, deaths and remarriages, this is a common problem.
    if you or any of your readers have a solution, i''d appreciate knowing it. torn.
    "dear torn: what are your alternatives? to deny agnes those exotic trips with
    her grandparents in order to avoid being envied by her half-sisters? not fair

    "torn" seems to expect that agnes'' grandparents treat her (torn''s) three younger

    does she take all her children to visit them, and refer to them as "grandma and

    and sent to them? are the girls encouraged to make presents for them on birthdays

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i confess to having felt a certain trepidation before viewing lou ferrigno in
    "arsenic and old lace." after all, ferrigno''s previous acting work has been confined
    mostly to the tv series "the incredible hulk," and i envisioned something like
    this in his drury lane south debut: martha brewster: "would you care for some
    tea, dear?" lou ferrigno (flexing prodigiously): "uuuuuuunnnnggghhhhhh!" the elements
    were in place, then, for a bizarre evening, and i wondered briefly what had lured
    me here. simple enough. i knew just enough about ferrigno to wonder if he could
    handle the role of the monstrous murderer in this classic joseph kesselring farce.
    and the price was right. that''s the secret behind drury lane''s long run of star-vehicle
    theater. the actor has some name recognition, the play promises to be entertaining
    enough, and the ticket price, at a $7.75 top (and as low as $6), makes it a financial
    gamble most viewers can afford to lose. in this instance, the viewers don''t lose.
    drury lane''s "arsenic and old lace" is far from flawless, but the performances
    are good and the humor, for the most part, rings true. no, ferrigno does not portray
    mortimer brewster, the role of the good brother in the play''s bizarre family
    that was made famous by cary grant in the film version. ferrigno, instead, plays
    jonathan brewster, mortimer''s murderous brother, and in so doing updates a terrific
    bit of theater humor. mortimer, you see, is the victim of a particularly slipshod
    job of plastic surgery. in the original play, the characters are supposed to say,
    "you look like boris karloff," which infuriates him--a line made funnier because
    karloff himself created the role of mortimer on broadway. but at drury lane, everyone
    says (what else), "you look like the incredible hulk," at which ferrigno displays
    outrage and, at one point, actually does say, "uuunngghhhh!" there are other "hulk"
    bits strewn here and there, all carried through fairly well. surprisingly, none
    of this really intrudes. this is a highly silly comedy, and a bit of external
    silliness doesn''t hurt. ferrigno poses no threat to the memory of karloff or
    raymond massey (who took the role in the film). his well publicized speech impediment
    upsets the cadence of a few lines: but in portraying the maniacal jonathan, an
    awkward delivery is no real hindrance. and ferrigno''s imposing physical presence
    makes jonathan menacing in a very real sense. the rest of the cast does an excellent
    job of support. particularly enjoyable is jane maciver, delightful as the sweet
    but equally murderous martha brewster, and barbara woods, as an appealing elaine
    harper, mortimer''s girl friend. dennis kennedy, who takes dr. einstein to hysterical
    comical heights, steals scene after scene. vernon schwartz'' direction is brisk.
    in the end, the patrons of drury lane south get just what they''re after: a recognizable
    tv star in a funny, inoffensive play. they get to see if lou is as big as he seems,
    and if he can act a little. he is and he can, and the price is right. "arsenic
    and old lace" a comedy by joseph kesselring, directed by vernon d. schwartz, with

    are wrong with him: he''s always late. we have missed the beginnings of stage
    plays, concerts, weddings, parties and sports events because he is never on time.
    he procrastinates. he keeps putting things off until it''s too late. he promises

    without me, which tears me apart. he''s well- fixed financially and could easily
    take me. otherwise, we get along fantastically well. we do silly, impulsive things

    what is wrong with psychiatrists? i''ve been searching for a good one for 22 years.

    i said to my last doctor, "i need a compliment," and he said, "well, compliment
    yourself." the question that seems to be the favorite of all psychiatrists is,
    "do you really want help?" i told my last one, "would i be spending $90 an hour
    if i didn''t really want help?" there is even a joke out about this. it goes like
    this: question: how many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? answer:
    one, if the light bulb really wants to change. the only one i found that was any
    good lives 200 miles from me, so i call him up and we talk on the phone. i purposely
    stay behind on my bill because i''m afraid if i get caught up, he''ll drop me.

    my dear departed mother felt the same way, so she decided to hold a "wake" while
    she was still around to enjoy it. mother contacted all her relatives and told
    them she was having her "wake" early, and if they came to this one, they could
    skip the real one. the whole family showed up, and it was the best wake i ever
    attended. my mother also had the time of her life (at the first one, that is).

  body: 'dear readers: tomorrow will mark the ninth annual great american smokeout,
    an upbeat, good-humored, one-day campaign to encourage smokers to quit smoking
    for 24 hours--ust to prove they can do it. the idea was conceived by the american
    cancer society, which insists that anyone who can live without a cigarette for
    24 hours can quit forever. so, if you''re hooked on cigarettes (or cigars) and
    you really want to quit, why not start tomorrow--for just 24 hours? the following
    information may motivate you: according to dr. william g. cahan, attending surgeon
    at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center in new york, lung cancer is the single
    largest contributor to the total cancer death rate. it accounts for 25 percent
    of all cancer deaths in the united states. it is estimated that 85 percent of
    all lung cancer cases are due to cigarette smoking. as a smoker, you are 10 times
    more likely to die of lung cancer than a non-smoker. this year there will be 98,000
    lung cancer cases among men and 48,000 among women. of these, 87,000 men and 38,000
    women will die of the disease. the number of women who will die of lung cancer
    is increasing at an alarming rate. breast cancer used to be the biggest killer
    for women--now it''s lung cancer! a word about smoking-related diseases--emphysema,
    chronic bronchitis and heart disease. this year an estimated 350,000 will die
    from one of these. this total exceeds the number of u.s. deaths in world war ii;
    it is eight times as many people who die in automobile accidents. a congressional
    study has just reported that health costs from the adverse effects of smoking
    have reached a new high of $65 billion a year in increased medical bills and lost
    productivity. the loss in death and disability cannot be measured. (and how does
    one measure the amount of heartache, remorse and guilt suffered as a result of
    a preventable, self- induced tragedy?) what about "secondhand" smoke? is it actually
    damaging to non-smokers to be in the presence of those who are smoking? according
    to dr. cahan, the answer is yes. furthermore, studies reveal that the children
    of smokers are more prone to lung problems and allergies than children of non-smokers.
    for years i have begged my young readers, "if you smoke, quit now. if you don''t
    smoke, don''t start!" yet, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 kids light up for the first
    time every day. why? peer pressure, no doubt. "how about the rights of smokers?"
    you ask. of course they are entitled to smoke if they wish. but they will have
    to find a place where they can smoke to their hearts'' content without offending
    those who can''t tolerate it. "quitting cold turkey" is the hardest way to quit,
    but my readers have told me it''s the most effective, and in the long run, the
    easiest way. cutting down is less traumatic, but the temptation to smoke is often
    too powerful to resist while smoking just one, two or three cigarettes a day.
    those who are heavily addicted may require professional help to break the habit.
    so, if you''re hooked on cigarettes or have been telling yourself, "one of these
    days i''m going to quit," why not start tomorrow--for just 24 hours? it won''t
    be easy, but i can promise you, it will be the best thanksgiving present you can
    give yourself--and those who love you. the american cancer society has put together
    a wonderful booklet, "how to stay quit through the holidays." it''s free. pick
    one up at your local american cancer society office, or write for one, and please
    include a stamped, self-addressed envelope. the address is in your telephone book.
    p.s. a favor, please? if you quit tomorrow even for 24 hours, i want to hear from
    you. then write again and let me know how long you were able to stay clean. good
    luck. problems? write to abby. for a personal, unpublished reply, send a self-
    addressed, stamped envelope to abby, p.o. box 38923, hollywood, calif. 90038.

    my husband and i just received a letter that threw us for a loop, and we don''t
    know what to do about it. it was from our daughter, married for a short time and
    living in another town. she tells us that she knows we plan on giving her and
    her husband something for christmas, so if we really want to give them something
    they need, to give them the cash! she went on to say they don''t need "things,"
    but they are in debt and could use the cash to help pay off some of their obligations.
    we are, of course, distressed to learn that these newlyweds are so hard up, but
    our idea of a christmas gift is not cash. now we are sorry they were so frank
    with us. i think this was very nervy of them. a gift is one thing, but helping
    them pay their bills is something we had not planned to do. should we ignore their
    request and give them gifts as we had intended? or should we just send them a
    check to help pay off their bills? they both have jobs, if that will help you
    tell us what to do. can''t decide.'

    they do not necessarily sow, nor do they reap. how can their accomplishments be

    i read your column only as an appeasement to my wife of 43 years. you and mr.
    ed of richmond may make light of mule appreciation day to honor the hybrid who

    differently, no doubt, when he accepted a pair of jackasses as a gift from king

  body: 'dear readers: by popular demand, here is my traditional thanksgiving column:
    thursday is thanksgiving day, so take a few minutes to think about what you have
    to be thankful for. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived
    this long. a lot of people haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands--maybe millions--are
    hurting more. (have you ever visited a veterans hospital? or a rehabilitation
    clinic for crippled children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear
    the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast
    table on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise the lord!
    a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world
    is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security.
    in fact, one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are
    you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, call someone.
    go out of your way to do something nice for somebody. it''s a sure cure for the
    blues. are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our system has
    been saved by such concern. concern for fair play under the law. your country
    may not be a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds. freedom rings!
    look and listen. you can still worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret
    ballot and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head
    or a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different
    system, you are free to go. there are no walls or fences--nothing to keep you
    here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will
    want to use it at your table thursday: o, heavenly father: we thank thee for food
    and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank
    thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember
    the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service, that thy gifts to us
    may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving, and may god bless
    you and yours. love, abby. p.s. want an instant high? the surest cure for the
    post-holiday blues is to do something nice for someone. why not call someone who
    lives alone and invite him (or her) over for dinner or leftovers? better yet,
    call and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." (many
    older people don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out alone after
    dark.) try it. and let me know the results.'

    him, he goes on an assignment--usually out of town for a few days. he told me
    all about his previous marriages. he married no. 1 at age 22. five years into
    that marriage, he fell for another woman and divorced no. 1 for no. 2. that marriage
    ended seven years later when he fell in love with another woman, who became no.
    3. that lasted until he met me. he cheated on no. 3 (with me) until he divorced
    her. now that we are married, i am very nervous. i can''t trust him. when his
    boss calls him to go out of town, i wonder if he is really working or seeing another
    woman. he used to pull this on his third wife so we could be together. when he
    calls me from out of town to tell me he "loves" me, i remember him doing that
    to his third wife when he was holding me in his arms. i want this marriage to
    last. how can i be sure he isn''t cheating on me? i am desperate. insecure'

    a very dear friend of mine has been a widow for many years. then she met this

    when nude photographs of madonna appeared in two national magazines not long ago,
    there seemed to be more comments about the hair under her arms than about her
    lack of clothing. some said it was a turn-on. others said: "yechhh, ugh, and totally
    gross." why do people feel so strongly about body hair? why do some people think
    hairy is scary while others find it incredibly sensuous? why is there social pressure
    for women--but not men--to shave their legs and underarms? and what makes a man
    want a mustache? there are no definitive answers to any of these questions. science
    is still working on the comparatively easier problem: why do we fight over politics
    and religion? body hair, of course, is something all humans have in common. human
    beings have exactly as many hairs on their body as do gorillas--though not, obviously,
    as long and thick. humans have hair everywhere except the palms of the hands and
    soles of the feet. there are some racial differences. oriental peoples have the
    least amount of noticeable hair; southern european and mediterranean groups, the
    most. black people have more hair than orientals but less than northern europeans
    and scandinavians. there are also sexual differences. men tend to be hairier than
    women, and have the ability to grow a beard. all very mysterious. as are the differences
    of personal choice. take beards. the average man''s beard contains 15,500 hairs
    and grows about 5 1/2 inches a year. clearly, mother nature intended man to have
    a hairy chin, yet most men are determined to foil mother nature. eighty-six percent
    of american men shave. shaving is not new. pictures of beardless men have even
    been found on the walls of prehistoric caves even though, in those days, to even
    get down to stubble level meant scraping the face with a sharpened clamshell or
    animal tooth. no shaving cream, of course. why would they bother? maybe they wanted
    to avoid having bugs nest on their chin (sanitation wasn''t great in those days).
    maybe--this is said to be true of the ancient egyptians--the caveman rid himself
    of whiskers so that an enemy could not get a hand-hold on his face in one-on-one
    combat. or just maybe, they--or their wives--simply didn''t like beards. this
    desire to shave has led man on an endless quest to find easier ways to do it.
    the clamshell was replaced by the sharpened flint, which was replaced by various
    metals. the undisputed hero of modern-day shaving is king c. gillette who, in
    1895, invented "the safety razor"--a removable blade in a holder that, for the
    first time, reduced the danger of shavers slitting their own throats. beards,
    of course, have been in vogue at various times. after the hairy goths overran
    the beardless romans, anyone who shaved was considered a wimp. but, despite the
    hazards, shaving kept coming back in favor. when alexander the great decided to
    shave his beard, all male macedonians followed their leader. men who grew beards
    in the united states in the ''60s were considered radicals. some were even fired
    for refusing to shave. just this year, the u.s. navy issued a ban on beards. but
    one really can''t be sure how individuals will react to a given beard. even very
    conservative types never objected to the idea that god and santa claus are always
    portrayed with beards. joe veasy, owner of the south square supermarket in philadelphia,
    says some customers'' attitude toward him changed when he grew a beard a few years
    ago. veasy wasn''t very happy with the beard because it came in gray, rather than
    red like the hair on his head (beards are usually the first to go). but while
    he had it, he says, some women shoppers who had formerly been very formal, even
    distant with him, were now willing to stop and chat. he can''t explain it. so
    much for beards. let us proceed now to the issue of women shaving their underarms
    and legs. it is not known whether cavewomen borrowed their husband''s clamshells,
    but it is known that the ancient greeks believed that women''s limbs should be
    as smooth--and hairless--as marble. the ancient roman poet ovid compared hair
    on women''s legs to that of a goat. yet in europe, until only recently, women
    with body hair were considered sexy. in tolstoy''s "war and peace," princess bolkonskaya
    who had "downy hair on her upper lip" was described as a great beauty and the
    toast of st. petersburg. in america, female body hair is widely considered as
    unsexy and unsanitary. not to everyone, of course. but shaving in america boomed
    after the 1920s when women began wearing shorter shirts, silk stockings and otherwise
    revealing clothing. some modern-day feminists claim that pressuring women to have
    hair-free armpits and legs is a plot to keep women childlike--since hair begins
    to grow at adolescence. they argue that women should refuse to shave as a protest.
    but according to the gillete company (which sells 70 percent of all razors, 60
    percent of all blades in the country) 85 percent of american women today--feminists
    included--aim for that old greek ideal. as you might imagine, going against majority
    custom is not always easy. a connecticut waitress was fired because her boss thought
    that diners would lose their appetites at the sight of her unshaved legs. (she
    later got her job back by agreeing to wear opaque stockings.) a woman wrote to
    dear abby to complain that she was tossed out of a swim club because of her body
    hair. according to dr. frank johnson, chairman of the department of anthropology
    at the university of pennsylvania, human beings use hair as a means of non-verbal
    communication. but then, it is common in the animal kingdom to send messages via
    hair. when monkeys are threatened, for example, the hair on the back of their
    necks stands up. the idea is to make them look larger, more scary to the enemy.
    fur coloration is very important to animals in recognizing or hiding from each
    other. and, speaking of fur, why, you might wonder, is ours so sparse? pennsylvania
    state university evolutionist dr. robert eckhardt says that because hair and skin
    do not turn into fossils as bones do, actual evidence of how human hair evolved
    does not exist, but there are some theories. his own is that when apes came down
    from the trees somewhere around 10 million years ago, they found themselves in
    a shrinking tropical forest. because the forest was shrinking, some of the apes
    became hunters of meat to supplement their leafy diets. and because the forest
    was tropical, the hunting apes had to shed their hairy coats to keep cool while
    chasing prey. (one might add that, of all animals, humans have the largest number
    and density of sweat glands, which also act to cool them when they run.) hair
    on the head remained, so it is thought, to provide insulation for the brain. that,
    of course, does not explain why so many brainy men go bald. hair grows longer
    in the underarm and pubic areas, goes another theory, to amplify odors that attract
    males to females and vice versa. men supposedly have hair on their chin to signal
    their difference from boys--and at a distance, from women. or maybe men''s chins
    needed insulation at some point in time? there are several beliefs that people
    have about body hair that science knows are not true. for example, many people
    believe that having hair on your chest makes a man more virile. "there is no proof
    at all of that," says dr. paul gross, head of the section of dermatology of pennsylvania
    hospital and director of the institute for cosmetic enhancement. there is also
    no proof, he says, that bald men are especially sexy. "that belief may originated
    with the fact that eunuchs do not grow bald," he comments. and it is also not
    true, says dr. gross, that shaving makes hair grow back faster or thicker than
    before. "women say to me, ''i wish i had never started shaving,'' but it makes
    no difference at all." caption: photo: modern-day shavers can thank king c. gillette

    our daughter was married recently at a formal church wedding, which we arranged
    to have videotaped at a considerable cost to us. i heard that several people were
    planning to bring their children (several under 3 years of age); so we made arrangements
    to have the church nursery opened, and we even paid two licensed nursery workers
    to look after the children during the wedding. the ushers were instructed to politely
    ask those who brought children to take them to the nursery. i was astonished at
    the number of guests who pushed past the ushers, ignored their request and took
    their children to sit with them during the wedding. some children became restless
    during the ceremony and started to talk and whine. instead of being taken out
    of the church, they were "shushed" and scolded, all clearly audible on the tapes.
    these same children were permitted to crawl around on the floor during the reception!

    one big joke, and, abby, those were the most painful years of my life. i am an
    adult now and want to put those painful memories behind me, but how can i when
    they keep repeating the same stories every year? oh, i''m a good sport, and i
    laugh right along with them, pretending it doesn''t bother me, but it does. my
    husband just hates it when they bring up stuff that hurts my feelings. he doesn''t
    care too much for my family for this reason. i try not to let these things get
    to me, but it gets harder every year, and i now dread going home for the holidays.
    is there a practical solution? anonymous, please.'

    it was wonderful to see my late father''s poem, "the man in the glass," in print
    again. i am happy to identify the author. he is dale wimbrow. that poem was printed
    initially in the american magazine in 1934 as the response to a young boy''s question,
    "does it pay to be honest?" i find it hard to understand how a person could claim
    the work of another, especially when the theme is "honesty." over the years, "the
    man in the glass" has gained wide popularity. it was copyrighted in 1934, but
    appeared numerous times as a poem whose author was unknown. my father has written
    a lot of poetry. he also founded the indian river news in sebastian, fla., a weekly
    publication that won the first editorial award ever presented by the florida press
    association. sally wimbrow, sebastian, fla. confidential to r.n.: to put it another
    way, i saw a bumper sticker in harrisburg, pa., that read: "make love, not war--but
    be prepared for both." every teenager should know the truth about sex, drugs and
    how to be happy. for abby''s booklet, send your name and address clearly printed
    with a check or money order for $2.50 and a long, stamped (39 cents) addressed
    envelope to dear abby, teen booklet, p.o. box 38923, hollywood, calif. 90038.'

    my older brother recently married a divorced woman with a 10- year-old daughter.
    my brother has always been attracted to little girls. his stepdaughter (i''ll
    call her mary) is well-developed for her age. lately she''s been asking for a
    lock for her bedroom door. this is all she requested from her grandmother (my
    mother) for christmas. i don''t like to think bad things about my brother, but
    i have bad feelings about the whole thing. you hear so much these days about adults
    molesting kids. should i ask mary any questions? she doesn''t seem to like to
    be alone with my brother. i once saw mary in such a depression (no one noticed
    it but me), and when i asked her what was wrong, she nearly burst into tears.
    i feel helpless, but i want to help her if there is something wrong with the family
    situation. to give you a little background about my brother: he has lived with
    many women before (all with little girls). he spent a lot of time with an uncle
    who was caught molesting his young nieces. please tell me how to deal with this,
    or should i mind my own business? if my brother is guilty and i bring it out in
    the open, i''m afraid my whole family will hate me. i don''t want to give my name,
    so please answer in the paper. i will be reading you faithfully every day looking
    for an answer. heartsick in maine.'

    my brother and his wife (i''ll call her dora) left town to attend the wedding

    i received a telephone call from dora''s mother who lives in europe. she told
    me that her son (dora''s brother) had died suddenly, and asked me to please notify
    dora. i phoned dora immediately, thinking she might want to make plans to fly
    to europe right after the wedding to attend her brother''s funeral and console
    her mother. as it turned out, dora didn''t go to europe at all. since then i have
    received a lot of criticism from other family members for passing along the message
    and "spoiling the wedding." i was told that i should have waited until after the
    wedding to give them the sad news. it seems to me that i would have been criticized

    i recently received a wedding invitation that included a card and a stamped, addressed
    envelope for my reply. the card had a place to fill in the name and a box for
    "number of persons." there was no place allotted for any other information such
    as "sorry, i cannot attend." rather than put a "zero" in the box for "number of
    persons attending," i didn''t return the card at all. i feel a little guilty about
    not responding. what would have been the correct thing to do under the circumstances?
    abby, please comment about people who send wedding invitations to business acquaintances
    (or clients) of the parents of one of the couple. as the wife of a professional
    man, i am getting fed up with receiving wedding invitations from people whose
    names i''ve never even heard! colorado communique.'

    as i write this, my head is splitting! the reason? too much perfume and cologne.
    i can hardly breathe. a fragrance is a very personal statement. i use it myself,
    but you can smell mine only if you get within three inches of me. my coworker''s
    fragrance can be smelled from five feet away, and i am not exaggerating! i have
    already asked this coworker to please tone down the stuff, and he did (yes, the
    offender is a "he"), but in a few days, he''s back at his old level. waiting for
    it to wear off during the day doesn''t help. by that time, i already have a headache.

    had too much class to '' utter such a remark. in the sixth book of his “confes

    in 1740 15 years before marie antoinette was born: "at length i recalled the ''
    thoughtless remark of a great prin cess. who, when she was told the peasants had
    no bread. replied. ‘let them eatcake. '' " in the dictionary of misinformation,
    author tom burnam notes the writing of alphonse karr, who in 1843 explained that
    a duchess of tuscany supposedly uttered the remark in 1760. karr contended the
    quote was used to discredit marie antoinette. serious biographers of the queen
    do not even grace the remark with a comment. as a newspaper editor, i hate to

    i''ve been reading with great interest the letters from women who are upset because
    their husbands forget "special" oecaslons such as birthdays. anniversaries. valentine''s
    day, etc. i used to he that ,way until i realized that my husband gives me "gifts"
    more often by the little things he does for me than by the things he buys for
    me. i nearly lost this wonderful man by my childish insistence that he give me
    cards-and gifts on special occasions. (a gift that’s begged for is not really
    a gift, is it?) when he rolls down the car window to let me hear the beautiful
    song of the meadowlark, that is a ''gift! when he takes me for a ride in the mountains
    to get me out of town, that is a gift because he is a long-haul trucker. when
    he takes me to a movie he knows i want to see when he’d rather stay home and watch
    a football game on tv. that is a gift! i could go on and on. but i think . you
    get the picture. now. after 24 years. i don’t need cards or flowers or "things"
    because i have precious memories that are with me always. only a very insecure
    person like i once was needs tangible reminders. i am thankful that i am secure

    recently you printed a true-ialse quiz titled "how much do you know about homosexuality?”
    you said all the statements in the quiz were false. i believe one statement is
    true: “if a person is gay. no amount of therapy or motivation can change him."
    my own study of bisexual or homosexual husbands (to be published soon) is the
    only study of married. gays with a six-yoar iollow-up.not one of the married men
    in our sample. despite years of "normal" married sex. has overcome the desire
    to be with men. if you have information with which i am not familiar, i would
    like to see it. if not, please eliminate that question, as it encourages homosexuals
    to seek useless therapy from counselors who have not carefully reviewed the research.
    and perhaps because of their'' own homophobia, or just from ignorance, try to
    ”help” the homosexual. the effect is (besides loss of time and money) to delay
    accepting (hopefully affirming) a gay identity. —david matteson ph.d. dear dr.
    matteson: you are oorrect.’1‘he statement in the quiz should have read: "if a

    dawn delivering newspapers. then come home for breakfast before going to school?
    “saddened” felt that a 10-hour day was out of line. many young people today are
    so involved in sports they spend at least four hours outside their school day
    either practicing or participating in one sport or another. this requires more

    their kids walk to school. . i lived a mile from school. my mother drove, but
    she didn''t drive me. she insisted that i walk. my friends'' mothers drove them
    and i thought my mother was being mean by making me walk, so i asked her why she
    didn''t drive me to school. she put her arms around me and said, "if i drive you,
    how will you learn, and have time to think? walk; and learn dear ” well i walked.
    and learned to love the smell of rain in the air and the feel of it on my face.
    i learned the feeling of snow crunching under my feet. i did a lot of thinking
    while i walked. it helped me to think things out instead of making quick decisions.
    i also met some nice people on the way. the lady who gave me a flower for my mother
    from her garden, the old man who was always waiting-by his mailbox for a letter
    or a card from his children. (none came, but cards for every special occasion
    did come from me.) i am 17 now, and i still walk whenever i can because i enjoy
    it. my mother was right. i learned a lot by walking. glad i walked reproduced

    recently a friend of mine (whom i’ll call john) bought four theater tickets—one
    for himself, one as a birthday gift for me, and two for friends of his. it was
    my understanding that john’s friends were going to pay him for their own tickets.
    about two hours before the performance, j ohn called and asked if i knew anyone
    who would like to come along because one of his friends had canceled at the last
    moment. i found a friend who was glad to go, and we all enjoyed the evening. afterward,
    i was astonished to learn that j ohn expected payment for the ticket! it was my
    impression that the ticket would have gone to waste if it hadn’t been used. who
    should pay for the ticket? john? the friend who canceled? 01: my friend who came
    along at the last moment? sticky situation dear sticky: if john’s two friends
    agreed to pay him for the tickets. then the friend who canceled at the last moment
    should have paid john whether he used it or not. when john called and asked if
    you knew of anyone who wanted to ”come along," you had every right to assume that
    john was offering the ticket at no charge, since there was no mention of money.

    my husband and i have been married less than a year and we really do love each
    other, but whenever we are out in public he "eyes” every attractive woman he sees.
    he''s very handsome, and of course these women look back at him, which irritates
    me. i feel unattractive and inferior, although i know i’m not. we have talked
    endlessly about this. he says it''s “normal” and i am nuts. abby, i don’t check
    out other men. in restaurants, his eyes are everywhere but on me. when we''re
    shopping his head is always turning to get a better look at some pretty woman.
    he blames my attitude on the fact that my mother divorced my father because he
    was a girl—watcher and philanderer. do other women feel this way? what do they
    do? can my husband change? should he? should i try to change? if so, how? i hate
    myself for hating my husband for making me so miserable. and finally, does girl-watching
    go hand in hand with infidelity? he’s never been unfaithful as far as i know.
    if you advise counseling, where can i go if i can''t afford a psychologist once
    a week at $50 an hour? please help me. except for this one fault, he’s a wonderful
    man, but i can’t live like this. watching him watchin g her dear watching: a man
    who eyes strange women in a way that causes them to look back is either consciously
    or unconsciously sending a message. i agree. you can’t live like thati nor should
    you. do other women feel this way? yes. what do they do? some of them go on making
    themselves ( and their husbands) miserable, but the smart ones realize that they
    can’t change anyone except themselves, so they contact a local mental health facility
    and arrange for low-cost counseling at a price they can afford to pay. also, some
    husbands can—and do—change. but not those who insist that giri-watching is “natural"
    and their wives are “nuts" to resent it. e]'

    you asked if male nurses were discriminated against. where have you been? during
    world war ii, male nurses were not commissioned in the military services, but
    females with exactly the same training in the same schools were! males weren’t
    commissioned until after 1954—— thanks to a lady named bolton who ramrodded it
    through congress. as a male nurse i soon realized that i had to find another approach
    if i wanted to advance, so i chose to parachute to downed air crews where i rendered
    medical care. i soon earned a commission and became a medical administrator. _
    . . male nurses have always been discriminated against. no one cares if a good
    samaritan is a male or female. but after the emergency is taken care of, we hear,

    i have this problem that has been on my mind for quite some time. i am married

    respectable, well-to-do, 74-year—old gentleman who has a living wife. he clearly
    loves me, and we get together for a few hours at his friend’s apartment at least
    one afternoon a week. i accept no money or gifts from him, but he told me that
    in his will he is leaving me his fine home and all the furnishings. i am now wondering
    how this will go over with his family if he should die before his wife? wouldn’t
    they wonder why he is being so good to me? his wife knows nothing about us. and
    this could be a terrible shock to her. i don’t want to ask him to leave me out
    of his will because i could sure use whatever he wants to leave me. ——worried

    my husband is one of fdur married brothers. all his brothers have beautiful homes,
    lovely furniture, new automobiles and certificates in the bank. my husband makes
    $20,000 a year. he could earn more. but he loves his job because it''s so rewarding
    in other ways. he''s a fine person and loves to help people. i work part time
    as a waitress. we aren’t foolish with our money. we pay our bills on time and
    save little or i nothing. . . the problem is his family get-togethers. (i have
    no family. i was raised in a children''s home.) his brothers and their wives always
    discuss what new item they’ve acquired—their new car. vcr, motorcycle. etc. his
    parents have started to ask us when we are going to buy a house. (we save all
    year to buy them nice christmas gifts.) his brothers have children. we have none.
    and it haunts me to think that if we do have children, they will wonder why they
    can''t have all the things their cousins have. , . i feel out of my league at
    these reunions with the sisters-in-law with big diamond engagement rings. designer
    clothes and their talk of what they have and the tlri)ps they take. (my husband
    isn’t bothered by this at al . we have a warm, loving relationship, and i never
    feel “poor”-— until i’m around his relatives. abby, i don''t want to attend the
    august family reunion. i‘ve asked my husband to go without me, but he says if
    he shows up alone, they might think we''re having marital problems. however, i
    don‘t want to subject myself to all the feelings of inferiority that surface.
    our financial situation is not apt to change. what do you think? poorest of‘ all
    dear ”poorest”: if you consider yourself “poorest” because you lack the material
    things your husband''s relatives have, that could be your problem. a warm. loving
    relationship with one’s mate and contentment with your lot are more precious than
    designer clothes, diamonds and trips. you could be the "richest" at the reunion.
    so please don’t measure your wealth in dollars and cents. i say. go. hold your
    head up. .and don‘t be blinded by the ''diamonds. reassess what you have and don’t
    sell yourself short. this may be a tall order. if it''s too tall at the moment.
    . it''s your privilege to avoid situations that are too painful to handle. good
    luck and god bless. el'

    i must comment. did you know that male nursing dates back to 1190 when the teutonic
    knights were founded to care for the wounded during the crusades? also, during
    biblical times, the knights of st. lazarus were founded to tend the lepers. i
    have had to face a great deal of prejudice while practicing my chosen profession.
    (no, i didn’t ever want to be a doctor. and yes. i care for female patients just
    as a female nurse would.) i feel that i am rendering a humanitarian service regardless
    of whether the patient is man or woman, rich or poor. black, white or yellow.
    my wife, who is also a registered nurse. has been very supportive. i realize that
    i am not alone and must do my part to bring the male nurse to an equal footing.
    until recently, the armed forces did not grant equal rank or pay to male registered
    nurses although our training was identical. (female nurses enjoyed officer status
    automatically. male nurses did not.) so here i stand. heterosexual and proud to
    be a nurse and a man. physicians. god bless them, spend a relatively short period
    of time with their patients. but nurses are there arot''md the clock, faithful
    advocates of the patients'' rights and needs. thank you, abby. for an opportunity
    to air my thoughtsraymond earl stanford rn savannah, ga. dear nurse stanford:
    well said. my mail these last few weeks has been filled to overflowing with kudos
    for the male nurse. read on iona letter that says it all: \'

    thanks to your column in the fresno bee. i became aware that you were able to
    help an american soldier return the identification papers taken from the body
    of a dead german soldier during world war 11. perhaps you can solve a similar
    dilemma of 41 years'' standing. i would like to return a sterling silver id bracelet
    to the family of a young sailor whose body my husband helped to prepare for burial
    at naval base hospital no. 18 on guam in 1944. the bracelet was engraved: michael
    hudzy 33773514 (his serial number). some time later, my husband was horrified
    to find this id bracelet in his jumper pocket, where he must have dropped it to
    free his hands for other things. he was afraid to turn it in for fear of being
    accused of theft. as he truly didn''t remember putting it into his pocket. he
    kept it all these years, hoping that somehow, someday, he could return it to the
    boy’s family. through the years i have written to the veterans administration
    and the department of records in washington. asking for the boy’s address through
    a gi insurance policy—anythlng—but my letters were never answered. not long before
    my husband‘s death in 1978. he mentioned again his desire to return this bracelet,
    feeling it must mean something to someone, some where. i still have it. can you
    help me return it to the family of mlchael hudzy? mrs. j.p.w.. fresno, calif.

    i am jewish. 33. was raised in the jewish faith and had the bar mitzvah when i
    was 13. however, i do not attend services except on the high holy days once a
    year. last year i fell in love with a wonderiul gentile girl. connie is 19 and
    an atheist. i want to marry her, and out of respect to my parents i want to be
    married in our synagogue by the rabbi who has been a family friend for many years.
    the problem is. the rabbi can''t marry us unless connie converts to j udaism.
    she is willing, and even agrees to raise our children in the jewish faith providing
    i become a practicing jew. she says if she takes the jewish faith she will follow
    it. but she''s not going to be the only jew in the family. this means attending
    services every friday night and observing all the holidays. 1 what do you think?

    i lost my beloved wife three''months ago to cancer. she was 65. i am 66. we had
    been married for 45 years and loved each other very much. during her illness i
    became reacquainted with a girl i knew in high school. ( we became roacquainted
    at the hospital while visiting our spouses.) her husband died of cancer five days
    after my wife. our friendship quickly blossomed into love. and we want to marry.
    my question: out of respect to our deceased mates, how long must we wait before
    marrying again? -—lif‘e is short dear life: the time to show respect is while
    your spouse is living. and if you have done so, you need not be concerned about
    how long you should wait before remarrying. however. you would both be wise to
    give yourselves sufficient time to work through your respective grief. having
    just been through an emotionally draining experience. it''s easy to confuse consolation.
    comfort, understanding and even relief with "love." give yourselves a little more
    time before making a legal commitment. el'

    a friend gave me these definitions of the various forms of government, and i thought
    you might want to share them with your readers: communism: you have two cows.
    the government takes both of them and gives you part of the milk. socialism: you
    have two cows. the government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. fascism:
    you have two cows. the government takes both cows and sells you the milk. nazism:
    you have two cows. the government takes both of them and shoots you. bureaucracy:
    you have two cows. the government takes both of them. shoots one. milks the other,
    then pours the milk down the drain. capitalism: you have two cows. you sell one
    of them and buy a bull. abby, what happens in a democracy? -mrs. j . mcc. dear

    suicide looked pretty good to me too. my husband and i had two beautiful children,
    ages 2 and 3. our own home, good jobs and lots of nice things. but i had to leave
    to "find myself.” leaving was especially easy when i found out that a couple of
    my "good buddies" at work wanted to he more than good buddies. i was queen of
    the may and it was party time. my husband filed for divorce and i went along,
    figuring it was what he wanted. (i found out later that it wasn''t.) fun time
    became less and less fun. and a year later i was living with one of my good buddies
    who wanted to get married, but i didn''t. what a mess i’d made of my life! i''d
    left a wonderful husband and babies for what? i wanted to go back. but i was too
    ashamed. i considered all the different methods of suicide i’d ever heard of,
    trying to decide which would be the least difficult for someone to clean up. and
    what if i failed? i could be paralyzed, have half a brain or be permanently damaged
    somehow. if i succeeded, what was waiting for me after this life? who would find
    me? my boyfriend? someone in my family? a stranger? my children''s precious faces
    kept popping into my head, and i saw people pitying them and whispering to one
    another, “their mother killed herself, you know." worst of all, my adorable babies
    would always think it was their fault because children feel guilty about anything
    that goes wrong in their family, and mine already had my divorce to contend with.
    i had to tough it out for them. i’d always believed in god. so i prayed. i told
    him: "god, i''ve messed up my life, so from now on i''m not going to do anything
    unless you tell me to do it. please, just take over my life and do what you want
    with me.” maybe you’ve never believed in god. but if you have just the faintest
    idea that he exists. give him a try; that''s all he needs to get you started.
    how he answered my prayer is another long story, with an enormously happy ending.
    i married again. to the most terrific guy in the world. we’ve been married for
    eight years, and it''s getting better all the time. (it was only nine years ago
    that i wanted to end my life.) we have a beautiful 14-month-old daughter. and

    i suppose my problem is a common one; but it doesn''t make me feel any better.
    you see, i''m'' a 25-year-old male, and i''ve never been out with a woman. it''s
    not that i don''t like women; it''sjust that i can''t seem to get up the courage
    to ask one out. i have no trouble talking with the women at work, but asking one
    of them out is a major problem. any advice you can give me will be appreciated.
    —depressed in astoria dear depressed: there''s more than one way to communicate.
    why not write one of the women a note inviting her to a movie. concert, dinner.

    will you please, please discourage high school and college graduates from sending
    graduation invitations to every distant relative they and their parents ever heard-of?
    we all know that sending “invitations" to people we hardly know is a ﬂagrant,
    shameless bid for a gift. and if, in a moment of weakness, one does send a gift,
    a bar''rage of birth announcements and invitations to weddings, showers and more
    graduations is sure to follow. i am a 75-year-old widow, living on social security
    and very little else. i just received a high school graduation invitation from
    the granddaughter of a third cousin whom i have not seen in so long i wouldn’t
    even recognize her. (i have never even met her granddaughter.) i have many relatives
    in this town, but i never hear {rem them unless they. are celebrating something
    that requires a gift. i have no car, yet they “invite" me to every imaginable
    event, knowing full well i can''t possibly attend. this is just shameless begging.
    i am not cheap. ijust sent a generous graduation git“ t to a neighbor girl who
    used to stop by every day to bring in my mail and newspaper, and ask if i needed
    any errands run. don’t suggest that i send “a nice card" to the relatives who
    send me invitations to events they know i can''t attend. we both know a card is
    not what these spongers want. " '' dear sick: judging from my june mail, you speak
    for many. don’t blame the graduates. in most cases, their parents send those “invitations.”

    my mother recently passed away. a cousin who was especially close to her since
    childhood asked if he might have some kind of memento as a keepsake. his request
    astonished and offended my brother. i said i thought the request was in good taste
    and reflected the love and closeness our cousin felt for our mother. such gifts
    have been offered to me. in two instances. and i was deeply appreciative of them.
    my husband’s favorite brother died many miles from us and his widow sent no keepsake
    to my husband. my husband wouldn''t presume to ask for anything. but i know he
    was both saddened and hurt by the oversight. what is your opinion about the practice
    of giving such keepsakes. and of relatives and close friends requesting same?
    '' never written before dear never written: grieving people have their minds on
    other things and should not be faulted should they overlook the giving of keepsakes
    to close friends and relatives. most people would rather do without than ask for
    one, but i think to make such a request is a compliment to the deceased—unless,
    of course, one asks to be remembered with the loved one ’s valuable stamp collection
    or diamond brooch. e]'

    last sunday i prepared an especially good company dinner and invited my mother-in-law.
    after dinner, my husband and three sons helped clear the table. while my mother-in-law

    heard my mother-in-law say to my husband, “what’ s taking her so long?" ‘ it took
    me an hour and a half to straighten up, and just as i was finishing, she came
    in the kitchen to say she was leaving. i said, “can''t you stay a while so we
    can visit?” she said. "no, i’m tired. and by the way, don''t you have a dishwasher?"
    i do. abby. but the dishes have to be scraped, all the edibles put away, floor

    my boyfriend and i want a big church wedding, but we can’t afford one, and it
    would take us four years to save the money, so we have come up with this idea.
    we would like to have a dutch-treat wedding. we could charge $32.60 a couple or
    $16.30 a person to cover food, drinks and a portion of the other expenses. like
    the hall, the music, flowers, table decorations. wedding cake, etc. i am 18 and
    so is my boyfriend. we are both virgins and want to stay that way until we’re
    married. we wouldn’t expect any wedding gifts other than pitching in for the dutch-treat
    wedding. i don’t know how much longer we can wait, abby. don’t you think a lot
    of folks would pay $32.60 a couple toward getting two good christians married?

    you missed the boat in your answer to "bewlldered,” the couple who were sure that
    if they left thelr conslderahle estate to their only daughter. she would spend
    it all on her "no-good” husband. you said. "there is no way you can control the
    way your daughter spends her inheritance." thls ls not so. you should have suggested
    that they consult a lawyer experienced in wills and trusts. and consider leaving
    the inheritance in a trust for the benefit of thelr daughter for her lifetime.
    the trustee (probably a bank) could be directed to distribute the money, from
    the income or principal. only for the daughter''s benefit, as the trustee decides
    is approprlate. while the son-ln-law would probably benefit lndl rectly from thle

    was beautiful and talented. but never seemedlnterested in boys the way most girls
    were. after her freshman year of college, she told me she had fallen in love with
    another womanl my world fell apart, abby. if she had had a normal heterosexual
    relationship, i would have overlooked everything else. i still pray that some

    abby aids: what it is and how to avoid it by abigail van buren dear readers: if
    you have no interest in aids, what it is. how people get it. how widespread it
    is. and how to protect yourself from becoming a victim. skip this column. in an
    effort to get. the facts, i consulted dr. michael gottlieb. the eminent ucla immunologist
    who discovered the aids syndrome in 1981. the information in this column was confirmed
    by an information officer at the centers for disease control in atlanta. what
    is aids? it is the name for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a virus that
    attacks and destroys the immune system, leaving its victims vulnerable to infections
    and innumerable diseases, including types of cancer. how widespread is aids? the
    epidemic is almost worldwide. since 1981. over 12,000 cases have been diagnosed
    in the united states alone, of which half have died from it. it is epidemic in
    central africa and haiti, and has also spread to europe and australia. it is estimated
    that 500,000 to 1 million people have already been exposed to the virus. all individuals
    exposed do not necessarily suc— cumb to aids, but they do have an increased risk
    of developing it. there can be an incubation period of several years between exposure
    to the virus and the development of aids, but the exact period of time is not
    known. . everyone should be concerned how is aids transmitted? the most significant
    route is by anal sex. oral sex and "oid-i‘ashioned" sexual intercourse with a
    person who has been infected by the aids virus. while most cases have occurred
    among homosexual or bisexual men who have had multiple partners. aids is not exclusively
    a homosexual disease. an increasing number of cases is being found among heterosexual
    (straight) men and women. all sexually ac tive men and women, gay or straight.
    should be concerned. the .virus is also spread by shared contaminated needles
    among drug abusers. also through blood products given to hemophiliacs and other
    recipients of blood. some good news: transmission through blood is expected to
    decrease since the screening of blood donors to detect the aids virus began in
    early 1985. how aids is not spread: there is absolutely no evidence that aids
    is spread by casual contact with infected individuals. it cannot be spread by
    sharing towels, food or eating utensils with a person who has aids. neither can
    it be spread by touching. hugging or body contact other than sexual intimacy.
    . search for a vaccine what can be done about aids? a massive national program
    of public education as well as continuing research for a vaccine is now under
    way. all sexually active people should avoid sex with multiple partners. they
    should also avoid contact with semen. (condoms, for example, may offer some protection.)
    it is important for all of us in the human family to show compassion and understanding
    to the victims of aids. they should not be avoided or ignored. i repeat. aids
    cannot be “caught" by touching or contact other than sexual. and although about
    70% of the aids victims are homosexual men, it is not strictly a homosexual disease.
    aids victims should be visited by their friends and relatives. there is no danger
    to anyone who visits or cares for a person who has aids. i repeat, aids is transmitted
    by sexual interaction with a person who has it. hugging, caressing. holding, shaking
    hands with or being in close contact with a victim will not put one at risk of
    being contaminated. don''t assume that every person who has aids is sexually promiscuous.
    one contact (even years ago) with someone who has it is sufficient to infect a
    person. a wife can get it innocently from a bisexual husband who had been infected
    years ago by an aids victim. how can one obtain more information about aids? a
    national hot line with an informative recording can be reached by calling (800)
    342-aids. many cities have a local aids information hot line. your telephone operator
    can advise you. now. you know as much about aids as i. and if you know someone
    who can use this information, please pass it along. reproduced with permission

    is either consciously or unconsciously trying to punish you. his having quit smoking
    may or may not be related to his sudden change in personality and behavior. this

    is something either physically or psychologically wrong with him. el'

    what do you think of a married man who''s in love with another woman, yet shares
    a home and bed with his wife and takes her on planned vacations? his wife is not
    well mentally and practically lives on medication. the question is. should a man
    who is in love with another woman, be taking his wife on vacations? is he doing
    it out of duty, obligation or guilt? family functions i could understand, but
    planned vacations? '' please help the other woman to understand. hurting dear
    hurting: the man in question could be taking his wife on planned vacations because
    he wants to. (he could even “love" her.) what you should “understand" is that
    if he had intended to leave her for you. he probably would have already done so.
    understand also that your wishes will always come second because you are only
    the “other woman" and she is his wife. do you hate to write letters because you
    don’t know what to say? thank-you notes, sympathy letters, congratulations, how

    1n the 73 years of my life. 48 of them spent with my wife. who died three years

    and they licked the dish clean. this past year i became acquainted with a pennsyl

    and said only people of "slum caliber''i did that. in my neck of the woods. neither
    of these two practices were thought to be so terrible. i''ve been a farmer most
    of my life, and i''ve never found anything that wouldn''t wash off. do you think
    i should stop giving my dog a bath in the kitchen sink and refrain from letting

    —frank dear frank: the lady''s criticism is less troubling than the way she phrased
    it—"people of slum caliber." a lot of nice middle-class people bathe their dogs
    in the kitchen sink, which is all right as long as the sink is well cleaned afterward.
    letting a pet lick the ice cream dish clean is another matter, however. boiling

    she doesn’t eat right and she cries for hours every day. when i was a kid growing
    up, dad would come home from work. take his shoes off and read your column. so.

    recently my 16-year-old son was a ?gllbearer at the funeral of his friend. juan
    carlos. also juan was a fine boy. clean-cut. courteous. an honor student (second
    in his class of 132) and an altar server of his church. he was an only child—his
    mother was 45 and father 51 when he was born. they loved this boy so much—he wasn''t
    spoiled and had many friends. j uan was driving a small car. a birthday present
    from his parents. he changed lanes and was speeding to pass a "slow" car. he was
    killed in a head-on collision with a truck. he never had a chance. it could have
    happened to my son. or any other boy who took a chance and drove too fast. please
    run your article “please, god. i''m only 17.” it may save a young life. beverly
    graham. brownsville. tex. dear beverly: here it is. with my heartfelt sympathy
    to the family of juan carlos: please. god, i''m only 17 the day i died was an
    ordinary school day. how i wish i had taken the bus! but i was too cool for the
    bus. i remember how i wheedled the car out of mom. "special favor," i pleaded.
    “all the kids drive.” when the 2:50 bell rang, i threw all my books in the locker.
    i was free until 8:40 tomorrow morningl i ran to the parking lot, excited at the
    thought of driving a car and being my own boss. free! it doesn’t matter how the
    accident happened. i was goofing off—going too fast. taking crazy chances. but
    i was enjoying my freedom and having fun. the last thing i remember was passing
    an old lady who seemed to be going awfully slow. i heard a deafening crash and
    i felt a terrible jolt. glass and steel flew everywhere. my whole body seemed
    to be turning inside out. i heard myself scream. suddenly i awakened; it was very
    quiet. a police officer was standing over me. then i saw a doctor. my body was
    mangled. i was saturated with blood. pieces of jagged glass were sticking out
    all over. strange that i couldn’t feel anything. hey. don''t pull that sheet over
    my head! i can''t be dead. i''m only 17. i''ve got a date tonight. i’m supposed
    to grow up and have a wonderful life. i haven''t lived yet. i can''t be dead.
    later i was placed in a drawer. my folks had to identify me. why did they have
    to see me like this? why did-i have to look at mom’s eyes when she faced the most
    terrible ordeal of her life? dad suddenly looked like an old man. he told the
    man in charge, "yes, he is my son.” the funeral was a weird experience. i saw
    all my relatives and friends walk toward the casket. they passed by, one by one.
    and looked at me with the saddest eyes i’ve ever seen. some of my buddies were
    crying. a few of the girls touched my hand and sobbed as they walked away. please—somehody—wake
    me up! get me out of here! i can''t bear to see my mom and dad so broken up. my
    grandparents are so racked with grief they can hardly walk. my brother and sisters
    are like zombies. they move like robots. in a daze, everybody! no one can believe
    this. and i can’t believe it. either. please don''t bury me! i’m not dead! i have
    a lot of living to do! i want to laugh and run again. i want to sing and dance.
    please don’t put me in the ground. i promise if you give me just one more chance.
    god, i’ll be the most careful driver in the whole world. all i want is one more
    chance. please, god. i’m only 17! reproduced with permission of the copyright

    i’ve lived in this home for 25 years and have always used gas to heat it. last
    year my next-door neighbors decided to switch to wood. the wood-burning continues

    of burning wood. my eyes burn, my nose is stuffy and my sinuses hurt. wood-buming
    is allowed in this township. so i was advised to speak to my neighbors about this
    annoyance. i even offered to pay them $500 a winter not to burn wood, but they
    told me they didn’t want the money. i tried to seal my house up to keep the odor
    out, but it creeps in anyway. i can’t afford to move, and i’m uncomfortable with

    an activity is permitted by law does not make it moral, ethical or acceptable.

    a friend gave me these definitions of the various forms of governinent, and i
    thought you might want to share them with your readers. communism: you have two
    cows. the government takes both of them and gives you part of the milk. socialism:
    you have two cows. the government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. ''
    fascism. you have two cows. the government takes both cows and sells you the milk.
    nazism: you have two cows. the government takes both of them and shoots you. bureaucracy:
    you have two cows. the govern— ment takes both of them, shoots one, milks the
    other. then pours the milk down the drain. capitalism: you have two cows. you
    sell one of them and buy a bull. abby, what happens in a democracy? —mrs. j .
    mcc. dear mrs. mcc.: in a democracy, everyone has two cows, then a vote is taken
    and whatever the majority decides to do, you do, and that''s no bull! did i get
    letters! read on: dear abby. our founding fathers did not establish a democracy;
    they established a republic. let’s use the two cows to illustrate the difference:
    in a democracy, you have two cows. a vote is taken among all the people, 99% of
    whom never saw a cow; they think milk comes from the supermarket. whatever the
    majority decides you should do with your cows, you do—unless the government pays
    you not to raise cows, shoots one, milks the other one, and pours the milk down
    the drain in a republic you have two cows. you can sell one and buy a bull, have
    one or both out up into steaks or sell both and move into a condominium because
    under a republic each person has the inalienable right to do whatever he darn
    well pleases to do with his property. and that’s no bull either. around here,
    we call it liberty. —jon a. holiday. hollywood. calif.'

    the letter you published recently from a healthy man asking why he must die before
    donating one of his kidneys brings to mind my own recent experience. i am a relatively
    healthy middle-aged man who recently went through two emergency major surgical
    procedures. my organs.1 assume. are in fine condition. and i would have been willing
    and happy to sign an organ donor certificate. although my life was in imminent
    danger. neither my surgeon. my family physician, nor anyone at the hospital made
    such a suggestion. during my recuperation, i saw a group of people on a television
    talk show who were anxiously awaiting kidney donors in order that their lives
    could be saved. why can''t the medical community he more cooperao'' tive to those
    organizations handling organ transplants so that in situations such as mine, the
    opportunity to gain healthy organs is not lost? ‘ —anonymous attorney dear anonymous
    attorney: good question. but it would seem inappropriate, and downright ghoulish,
    to suggest to one whose life is in imminent danger to sign an organ donor card.
    although millions of people carry donor cards indicating that immediately after
    their death their usable organs may be harvested to help the living. the majority
    do not. thank you for giving me the opportunity to remind others to become organ
    donors. there is absolutely no cost to the donor or the recipient of any organs
    donated after death. this little essay, written by robert n. test. brought a windfall
    of new donors each .time it was run. let’s hope history will repeat itself: “at
    a certain moment a doctor will determine that my brain has ceased to function

    has volunteered to pay to have my son’s cat neutered, but i resent having my cat
    singled out for neutering. i say as long as this cat lover feeds that wild stray,
    she’ll stay, right? what should i do? '' cat crazy in murray. ky. dear cat crazy:
    as long as your son’s cat stays with you, it’s your responsibility to keep him
    locked up. and if you can''t do that, he should be neutered. contrary to your
    son’s fears, neutering will not alter the cat’s personality. because stray (wild)
    animals that forage for food frequently fall victim to diseases (rabies, for example).
    putting children and pets at risk, your humane society should try harder to catch
    the wild female and put an end to her reproducing all over the neighborhood. and
    unless you keep your romeo from the neighborhood j uliet, you are compounding
    a “feliney.” (sorry.) el'

    i’ve been dating “doug” off and on for four years. during a time when we were
    "off,” he had a little vacation romance with a california girl he met in aspen.
    i’ll call her sheila. then he started dating me again. five months ago sheila
    came to visit him. he felt that since she made the trip, he. owed her a few evenings
    alone. he hoped i''d understand his situation. well. i didn’t understand. he refused
    to introduce us. which upset me terribly. we broke up for about a‘ month, then
    resumed our relationship more in love than ever. he even started talking marriage.
    now i learn that sheila is pregnant, and she told doug that the baby is his..there''s
    a question in his mind because she had been dating another guy at the same time.
    she is now five months along. doug says he loves me and doesn’t want this mess
    to come between us. he says that even if the baby is his, he won’t marry her and
    wants nothing to do with the child. all he wants is me. what should i do? i really
    love him. in deep in denver dear in: i think he’s shown his colors; and there''s
    more yellow than true blue. a man who has sex with a woman, whether he "loves”
    her or not, should take responsibility for his actions. if he’s man enough to
    make a baby, he should be man enough to shoulder the financial (if not the emotional)
    responsibilities of fatherhood. i’d lose this loser. reproduced with permission

    i am trying to decide whether i should elope or have a big wedding. years ago.
    weddings weren''t as expensive as they are today. the cost of putting on a wedding
    has gone up, but the amount of money people spend on gifts has not. on the average
    it costs $15 per person for food and $5 for drinks—that''s $40 a couple, right?
    so unless each guest gives a gift worth $20—$40 a couple— —you won ’t even break
    evenl years ago, weddings were put on to give the new couple a good start. nowadays,
    people are so cheap, the couple would be better off eloping. i would like your
    input on this. —bride to be dear bride: i have always believed that the purpose
    of a wedding was to exchange vows before friends and relatives with whom the couple
    wanted to share their joy. whether the eouple''“broke even" or not didn’t occur
    to me. but since it occurs to you, i think you should play it safe and elope.

    too few people are concerned about one of the world’s most serious problems: overpopulation.
    at least 10 years ago. the father of six daughters wrote to ask if there was a
    foolproof way for him to get a son. and you replied, “adopt!" your one-word response
    was followed by a wonderful letter about a couple who finally had a son after
    four daughters. please run it again. that message needs to be heard again and
    again. mac in montana '' dear mac. i found the letter, and here it 13: dear helen
    and bill: so you finally had a boy? the only thing you can be congratulated on
    is your perseverance. .you can''t be congratulated on i your morality or unselfishness.
    adding three "extra" children to a world already reeling under its population
    load can’t be called either moral or unselfish. you can’t be congratulated on
    your fertility. after all, any clam, chicken or small furry animal can beat you
    at that. you can’t be congratulated on yourfine-famlly. a fine family is one that
    sets an example. and your example may kill us all in a few generations. you can’t
    even be congratulated on being able to afford five children, because you''re not
    paying for them. oh, you provide their food and clothing and shelter,but the rest
    of the world pays for their roads, schools. hospitals, air, wa-i ter. i o 0 you
    can''t be congratulated on being patriotic citizens, for if any thing destroys
    the united states it will be our "growthmania" spiral through which this country
    even . now gulps over 50% of the world’s resources. _ you can''t be congratulated
    for carrying on the family name. family names mean little unless people mean much,
    and your kind of growth rate guarantees that people mean less and less. unless,
    of course. three of those children are adopted? in that case,‘ congratulations.

    the letter from the man who worries whether thestaples used in his vasectomy might
    trip an airport''s security alarm reminds me of my problem. i''ve been single-breasted
    since my 1964 mastectomy. though i‘ve tried various prostheses, the one i’m most
    comfortable with—don’t laugh—is a plastic bag filled with birdseed. tightly closed
    and encased in a little cotton pouch. (i buy parakeet seed from the supermarket.)
    the birdseed shifts with my move— ments, as my natural breast does. but since
    i’m an a-cup, it isn’t heavy enough to keep from riding up, so i accepted my husband’s
    suggestion and added about a teaspoon of birdshot for added weight. query: if
    i wear this gadget when i fly. will the birdshot trip the security alarm? it would
    be most embarrassing if it did, so i leave it home, and wear a silicone prosthesis

    cliff has kept in touch with her all these years. he’s especially close to ellen''s
    son, who is being married next month. cliff plans to go to the wedding and says
    i am welcome to go with him, but i don’t really want to go. this has me so upset
    i can’t think straight. i’ve always wondered why cliff has taken such an interest

    a very dear friend of mine is having an affair with a married man. she divorced
    her husband of 14 years to be free for "joe." j as lived with my friend for a
    few months, then moved back home because his children "needed” him. joe goes to
    my friend''s place three or four mornings at week for coffee and sex. the rest
    of the time he is with his wife. j oe has given my friend some expensive gifts
    and takes her on some business trips. which is all she lives for. she’s beautiful
    and smart and has everything going for her. i’ve tried to tell her she’s wasting
    her time, but she says she loves joe and he’s worth waiting for. i know you get
    lots of letters from women who are waiting for married men to leave their wives.
    can you send me a few dozen? if i show them to my friend, she may see the light.
    thanks. all talked out in dallas dear talked out: a thousand letters wouldn’t
    convince your friend. she’s‘in love. and love is a mental condition; it doesn’t
    respond to logic. a woman in love cannot learn from the experiences of others
    because she perceives her love as uni.que-''-unlike any other. . occasionally
    a married man will divorce his wife ahd marry the other woman. so what does the
    other woman get? a man who cheats on his wife. el'

    i hired a self—employed contractor to install a swimming pool in our backyard.
    he arrived on the job with two helpers. one was his son who had brought along
    his child, about 3 or 4 years old. neither the contractor nor his son knew where
    the little boy was or what he was doing half the time. and they spent a lot of
    time looking for him. meanwhile i was paying $40 an hour for services that i did
    not receive. i couldn’t even go shopping because i was asked not to lock up the
    house because the child needed access to the bathroom frequently. a friend of
    mine had a similar experience. she called a plumber who arrived with a small child,
    who proceeded to take the house apart while the plumber was busy under her kitchen
    sink. these men would not be able to take children with them if they worked in
    a factory or office, so why do they take them on jobs at homes? (the plumber''s
    excuse: “i want to give my wife a break. ") abby, what would you have done in
    my place? timid in louisiana dear timidas soon as the contractor arrived with
    the child. i’ d have told him to please take the child home and leave him there.
    he had no business bringing the boy in the first place—it was unfair to the child
    and unfair to you, but'' he had nothing to lose by trying. moral: the timid will
    be taken advantage of unless they learn to speak up. reproduced with permission

    begin— ning to “circle the drain.” our friends, “ed and angie," have an only child
    i’ll call sue, who was conceived after 12 years of marriage. (they tried all that
    time.) sue is now 2 years old, and it’s impossible to carry on a normal conversation‘with
    angie without her bringing sue into the conversation. changing the subject doesn''t
    help. as angie always finds a way of getting back to sue. (ed isn''t as bad as
    angie, but he‘s had enough.) angie stays at home. she says she waited so long
    for sue she’s making a full-time career out of motherhood. i realize she is thrilled
    with motherhood. but that doesn’t give her the right to bore everybody to death
    with what sue said'' and .what sue did. talk of sue is getting on everybody’s
    nerves. my husband and i are beginning to avoid these old friends, and so are
    other friends of theirs. we really like them, but we have had all we can take.
    is there a solution? maybe if you print this, they’ll see it and take the hint.

    your advice to “ready to scream,” whose good friend came to visit with two undisciplined
    youngsters, sounded good, but have you ever tried it? ( you suggested having plenty
    of toys and coloring books to keep the kids busy so they wouldn''t tear the house
    apart. ) ‘ ‘ i tried that years ago, and this is what happened. although toys
    and coloring books were attractive and plentiful, the kids still preferred to
    pester their mothers, whining. interrupting, showing off, wander— ing around,
    pulling desk drawers open. asking for a drink of wateruanything to get attention.
    ’ eventually my problem solved itself. the kids grew up, got married and are now

    our son recently returned from a bible camp sponsored by our local church where
    the following incident occurred: it was late evening when 25 to 35 kids. aged
    13 and 14. were in the main dormitory with the lights out. suddenly a dozen or
    so men in camouflage uniforms burst into the dorm with lanterns. one was armed
    with a shotgun. another had a rifle. they said they were an anti-christian organization.
    no one was allowed to leave and several children were shoved and cuffed to indicate
    that they meant business. at first some kids laughed. then they became terrified
    and began to cry. several children managed to slip out through a side door and
    duck into a school bus where they hid under the seats. two girls were known to
    be held by the man who was carrying the rifle. two shots were fired. and some
    of the kids assumed the girls were dead. meanwhile. three other girls ran to a
    nearby cabin inhabited by some locals who became frightened and called the police.
    the police arrived and contacted the camp counselor who. by the way. was a respected
    teacher and wrestling coach. he admitted it was a mock raid to show the kids what
    could happen to christian children in some non-christian countries! my wife still
    thinks this was a good “educational '' experience" for our son. and that i missed
    the point. i am angry. to say the least. would you say this was educational? your

    when he subjected your children to an act of terrorism to make a point. although
    the raid was mock. the emotional impact of that horrifying experience was very
    real to those children. who may later need therapy to recover from recurring nightmares.
    your anger is justified. your wife missed the point. i think the counselor should
    be psychiatrically examined and if he'' 1s as sick as i think he'' 13. he should
    be relieved of his responsibilities as a teacher and counselor until he 15 treated

    in aless than sober condition to become a potential highway murderer. my damage

    behind the wheel of a car is an unquestionably greater hazard to greater numbers.

    have kicked the habit and are now determined to frustrate my enjoyment. i can
    assure you that as a recovered alcoholic, i have no inclination to deny the pleasures

    we have a mother''s day, a father''s day and now someone has proposed a wife''s
    day. therefore, why not a ”bachelor’s day”? there is a long list of bachelors
    who have made worthwhile contributions, and i think it’s time the state of bachelorhood
    was appropriately honored. some famous bachelors: saints paul, luke, francis of

    i''m an attractive, 24-year-old, outgoing woman with a problem that sounds simple.
    but it isn’t. when a man asks for my telephone number, how can i get out of giving
    it to him without hurting his feelings? when i meet a man that i have no interest
    in dating and he asks for my telephone number, i find myself giving it to him
    because i don’t know how to refuse without hurting his feelings. afterward i''m
    angry at myself, but i still don’t know how i could have avoided giving it to
    him. i’m not the type who would give a man a wrong number. often stuck dear stuck:
    when someone asks for your telephone number and you don''t want to give it to
    him, tell him you are all booked up at the moment, but if he will give you his
    number, you will call him when you have some free time. further reproduction prohibited

    in a recent column you said that stuttering is the only physical handicap that
    people laugh at and ridicule. i disagree. people who suffer a hearing loss are
    also ridiculed. in fact, deafness, especially in older people, has been the focal
    point of many comedy skits over the years, and always seems to get a laugh. i
    have tears in my eyes as i write this. after numerous ear operations, i am now
    wearing two hearing aids, and have done all i can to hear. some stutterers are
    cured, but my hearing will never improve. please print this. it might make some
    people think twice before they say (laughingly). “what’s the matter? you deaf

    costly fire tragedies can be prevented van buren, abigail l05 angeles times (1923-current
    file); oct 7, 1985; proquest historical newspapers: los angeles times pg. e3 dear
    abby costly fire tragedies can be prevented by abigail van buren dear readers:
    last year in the united states. 5,240 people died in fires. the total loss in
    property alone came to $6.71 billion. this is fire prevention week. and although
    fires occur throughout the year, each season has its own special fire hazards.
    here are some tips for all seasons: fall: if you enjoy camping, select a tent
    made of flame-resistant fabric. pack a reliable flashlight with plenty of extra
    batteries to light the inside of your tent—never use matches or candles. when
    building a '' campfire, place it downwind of your tent. and never try to hasten
    the burning by using gasoline or other f lammable liquid starters. if you use
    your fireplace, have your chimney professionally cleaned in the fall to make sure
    it’s in good condition for the coming season. winter: more fires occur during
    winter than in any other season. the reasons: home heating and the holiday season.
    keep careful watch if you use a portable heater, be sure it is placed away from
    combustibles—draperies, furniture, paper, etc. remember, the surface heat of some
    portable heaters may reach 500 degrees, so keep a careful watch on your children
    and warn them to keep away from heaters. hospitals are treating an increasing
    number of patients with burns resulting from contact with the‘ outside surface
    of some portable heaters. for a merry christmas, choose a christmas tree that
    does not have shedding needles, and keep it standing in water while it is in the
    house. if you choose an artificial tree. choose one that is flame-resistant. after
    holiday parties, before retiring, check your ashtrays for smoldering cigarette
    butts, and carefully examine all upholstered chairs and sofas to make sure that
    no “live” cigarette butts have fallen between the cushions. remember, most house
    fires occur between 8 pm. and 8 a.m., when people are sleeping. spring: take spring
    cleaning seriously—clean out your attic, basement. garage and workshop. throw
    out trash, especially combustibles such as rags. newspapers, magazines, boxes
    and scraps of wood. never smoke while fueling gas-powered lawn mowers or chain
    saws. if you must store gasoline, store it in a ventilated area in a can designed
    especially for that purpose. and store oily rags and paint in a cool place in
    tightly sealed metal containers. “dead” coals can reignite summer: when cooking
    out, never use flammable liquids near live coals. an explosion or flash fire could
    result. when you''ve finished cooking, soak the coals with water and make absolutely
    sure they''re out when you leave. smoldering coalsthat appear to be “dead" can
    reignite as much as a day later. if you use a propane gas grill, always have the
    lighted match in position before turning on the gas. some tips for all seasons:
    «~never smoke in bed. —never leave invalids or small children alone in the house—not
    even for "a few minutes." —never use flammable liquids for dry cleaning indoors.
    —i-iave periodic fire drills in your home to be sure everyone knows what to do
    in case of fire. —keep easy-to-use fire extinguishers in your kitchen, cottage,
    back bedrooms and on your boat. invest in smoke detectors, and be sure that they
    are kept dust-free and in working order. —-the telephone number of your fire department
    should be taped to every telephone in your house. if it isn''t, should a fire
    occur, don''t waste time trying to find it; get out, and call from a neighbor’s
    house. and once you are out, stay out. no treasure is worth risking your life
    for. it took less than three minutes to read this column. was it worth it? i hope
    so.—abby problems? write to abby. for a personal, unpublished reply, send a stamped,

    a reader wrote that she was going to a shower for a friend who was expecting triplets.
    hen question: “must i bring three presents, or is one gift acceptable?” your reply:
    “give three giftsﬂone for each baby; the cost of all three should amount to whatever
    you would have spent had your friend been expecting a single." abby. triplets
    are three children born together; had they been singles born a year apart, they
    would have been entitled to separate “whole value" gifts. neither the parents
    nor the children should be shortchanged at this time. the issue of multiples and
    gift-giving is far-reaching. when twins attend a birthday party, mothers should
    send them with two gifts of value that they would like to see reciprocated. since
    parents of singles often spend in the manner that you suggest, multiples "rarely
    receive a gift of similar value to what was given. in the reverse circumstances,
    when gifts are given to teachers, mothers of multiples should give the full amount
    per child because the teacher had the responsibility for two (or three) children.
    the perchild gif t acknowledges that the teacher had two hands to hold and two
    noses to wipe. friends and relatives could help by understanding that the circumstances
    of the birth should not affect the value of the gift. each child should be treated
    as an individual. diane weiss, president, nassau county mothers 0f twins club
    dear mrs. weiss: you are absolutely right. every child should receive a “whole”
    gift, but did you overlook the fact that the letter was signed “over budget”?
    in the interest of treating each child as an individual, i recommended three individual
    gifts instead of something all three could” share, such as a box of dusting powder,
    a record album or a game. read on for another point of view.'

    six girlsnno boys. the doctor told him that the mumps had fallen on his "boy side.”

    understand that willing one''s organs after death in order to improve the quality
    of life for the living is one of the most noble and generous acts a person can
    perform. besides. you own your body—your husband doesn’t. the possibility that
    some “scalpei-happy" surgeon might “murder" a patient for his parts is unrealistic,
    as a patient must be pronounced dead by two doctors before a death certificate
    is signed. and as for “needing" all your organs for the resurrection, the benevolent
    act of willing one''s organs after death has been approved by most religions,
    so should you return to live again in the body of your previous life, trust the
    good lord to miraculously restore or replace the missing parts. please give my

    those who presumably worry about their children who are out trick-or-treating
    on halloween should take a lesson from my mother and her friends. they never had
    to worry. we stayed home because she and her neighbors would toss the best party
    of the year—next to christmas. they did this with little effort, permitting the
    children to do most of the work and planning. hot dogs. hamburgers, soft drinks,
    cookies and cakes were in bountiful supply. we played games, bobbed for apples
    and received prizes for our costumes. growing up in a small town (population about
    9.000). i never heard of trick or treat until i moved to washington. d.c. we didn''t
    have to worry about poisoned candy, pins and razor blades in apples or the threat
    of being lured into the home of a stranger to be molested. i personally despise
    the custom of trick or treat and refuse to condone it by encouraging children
    to come to my door. call me scrooge. fortunately, more parents in my part of the
    country are beginning to see the sense in block parties on halloween. i hope it
    catches on and replaces the deplorable custom of setjding children out to beg
    for treats. concerned mother dear concerned: you hit upon something that has troubled
    me for a number of years. the very principle of trick or treat is pure and simple
    blackmail: “if you don''t give me a treat, i will play a trick on you"—the “trick"
    being anything from overturning garbage cans to soaping (or breaking) windows,
    or doing even more serious damage to property. this kind of vicious and antisocial
    behavior should not be tolerated. most police departments must call in extra hands
    on halloween to patrol the streets in an effort to protect private and public
    property. what began many years ago as a harmless holiday, celebrated by telling
    children scary ghost stories about imaginary witches. goblins and spirits, has
    turned into legalized blackmail. halloween has become scarier than ever. and i
    vote for abolishing the custom of trick or treat. dear readers: a few weeks ago

    file); oct 28, 1985; proquest historical newspapers: los angeles times pg. e3
    dear abby advice for kids left alone after schooi by abigail van buren dear readers:
    i havejust read a wonderful book titled “alone after school” by helen swan and
    victoria houston. it’s a complete self-care guide for latchkey children and their
    parents. now that more than 60% of american mothers work outside the home and
    about 10 million children under 12 years old are coming home to an empty house,
    this book is a timely treasure. it tells children what to do about accidents—bumps,
    bruises, burns. cuts, nosebleeds, poisoning, electric shock, stomachaches, etc.
    it covers every imaginable _ emergency, including what to do if somebody tries
    to break in; it stresses the importance of having the phone numbers of police,
    firemen, paramedics, neighbors and the 911 emergency number taped on every telephone.
    it tells a child how (and how not) to answer the door and telephone. there are
    simple recipes for children, and guidelines for parents on how to set up rules
    to keep peace between siblings. a single chapter titled “is my child ready?" is
    well worth the price of the book. it contains a checklist for parents to test
    a child’s readiness to be left alone. (age is not always the determining factor.)
    “alone after school" should be in every home where children are left unsupervised—if
    for only a few hours occasionally. it’s available at your local bookstore for
    $8.95. if it’s sold out, it can be ordered directly from the publisher by calling
    this toll-free number: (800) 238-2333. or send a check or money order to prentice-hall,
    englewood cliffs, nj. 07632 (add a dollar for postage). you’ll be glad you did.

    i hope i''m not too late to tell “going bananas” that there is definitely a correct
    way to eat a banana. i learned it in the late ’505 when i was a graduate student
    at smith college. one evening when the dessert consisted of a fruit bowl. including
    unpeeled bananas, our art instructor selected a banana and showed us how to eat
    it. (she said she learned it in switzerland.) the banana is placed on one''s fruit
    plate, concave side up. with the aid of a fruitlknife. the stem edge is notched,
    then the uppermost strip of peel is removed. making the banana look like a “boat."
    the banana is then eaten from the “boat” with a teaspoon. marian w. werner. rochester.

    last year. you alerted more americans to the hazard of liver disease than any

    king thiel. president american liver foundation dear thelma: i‘ll try. fellow
    americans! (with apologies to paul harvey): about 50.000 men. women and children
    die of liver disease every year. you may have liver disease and not be aware of
    it. because liver diseases show few symptoms until the damage is far advanced.
    there are no treatments or cures for most liver ailments except liver transplants.
    and livers are hard to come by. the liver is a miraculous organ; it manufactures
    blood, vitamins, bile. protein and amino acids. if it is mistreated. overworked
    or damaged. it will close down. and so will you. _ your liver has the job of "detoxing"
    all the poisons you take in—drugs. environmental pollutants, alcohol and other
    chemicals you eat. breathe and absorb through your skin. the clotting factors
    that stop the bleeding when you out yourself while shaving or peeling an apple
    are created by your liver. this is fair warning. and it could be the only one
    you will ever get. because your liver cannot tell you that it is going until it''s
    almost gone. liver damage can be prevented—if you know how. for a free booklet
    on how to care for your liver, send a long. self—addressed. stamped envelope to:
    the american liver foundation, 998 pompton ave. cedar grove. nj. 07009.'

    may i offer a few possible solutions to “henry." whose second wife (edith) refused

    a third. this would not have bothered me so much if he had not told me otherwise.

    i''m a 16-year-old girl. recently i went into the hospital for some minor surgery.

    most of the questions i would have truthfully answered no to. but my parents were
    in the room at the time, so i just said “no” to all those questions so as not
    to be grounded for the rest of my life. then i worried all the way up to the time

    or whatever they used to "put me under.” luckily, everything went well. abby,

    when i married sheldon (not his real name), we were very much in love. but he
    was a poor struggling college student, and my parents never thought he''d amount
    to much. i wasn’t exactly an heiress. but my grandparents had left me a little
    money. so my father thought i should have a prenuptial agreement—in case my ''marriage
    didn''t work out. that way i wouldn’t have to share my “inheritance” with sheldon.
    we had a lawyer draw up an agreement stating that what was mine would be mine.
    and what was sheldon''s would be sheldon’s. we both signed it. to make a long
    story short. it’s 19 years later and we have two great kids. as you probably have
    guessed. sheldon has become a very successful businessman. (he just paid $120,000
    in income taxes.) my problem is obvious. now i regret having signed that prenuptial
    agreement. don''t get me wrong, we have a very good marriage and i’d never consider
    leaving him. but what if he gets crazy a few years down the road and decides to
    leave me? would that prenuptial agreement prevent me from sharing in whathe has?
    —nervous dear nervous: your question is a good one. much would depend on which
    state you''re living in. talk to your lawyer today. you''ll sleep better tonight.

    as one who was rescued by alcoholics anonymous, i have long appreciated your continu
    ing public support of aa. however. i was deeply disturbed to read the letter in
    your column from "had my say." who was sick and tired of hearing that alcoholism
    is an "illness." and went on to call it a vice. a weakness and a lack of self-control.
    while i respect your policy of allowing people of divergent opinions to have their
    say in your column. i think you owe it to your readers to publish a responsible
    response. the american medical assn. does classify alcoholism as a disease. there
    is documented research showing that alcoholics have a different physiological
    makeup than non-alcoholics; their enzymes, genes. hormones and brain chemistry
    work together to create their abnormal reaction to alcohol. and yes. it is a hereditary.
    genetic disease. the alcoholic is never “cured." but by abstaining from alcohol
    one day at a time. he can escape the hell of compulsive drinking. although i had
    no choice of physiological makeup. today i do have a choice to stay sober a day
    at a time—or take one drink and spiral back into illness. i know that i will never
    be able to drink “normally" again. knowing that alcoholism is an illness has inspired
    me to seek the help i need to stay sober. had my say. t00 dear had: as a recovering
    alcoholic, you are well aware that the alcoholic goes through a period of denial.
    he tells himself. "i am a social drinker. . . . i can take it or leave it alone."
    when he finally reaches the point where he is taking more than he is leaving alone,
    and the taking becomes costly in terms of friends. family and job. then he must
    face the truth: he can''t drink at all. ever. alcoholism is a disease—not a disgrace.
    readers, if you really don''t know whether or not you have a problem with alcohol,
    i offer you this test: l—have you ever decided to stop drinking for a week or
    so, but only lasted for a couple of days? yes( );no( ). 2—do you wish people would
    stop nagging you aboutyourdrinking?yes( ):no( ). 3—have you ever switched from
    one kind of drink to another in the hope that this would keep you from gettingdrunk?yes(
    ):no( ) 4—have you had a drink in the morning during thv pastyear? yes( );no(
    ). 5—do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble? yes( ): no
    ( ). 6—have you had problems connected with drinking during the past year? yes
    i i: no ( j. 7—has your drinking caused trouble at home? yes ( ); no ( ). 8—do
    you ever try to get “extra” drinks at a party because you did not get enough to
    drink? yes ( i: no ( ). 9—do you tell yourself you can stop drinking anytime you
    want to. even though you keep getting drunk when you don‘t mean to? yes ( j: no
    ( ). 10—have you missed days at work because of drinking? yes ( ); no ( ). 11—do
    you have "blackouts"? yes ( i; no ( ). 12—have you ever felt that your life would
    be better ifyou did not drink? yes ( ); no( ). if you answered “yes" to four or
    more of those questions. you are in deep trouble. alcoholics anonymous is a fellowship
    of men and women who share their experience. strength and hope with one another
    so that they may solve a common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.

    it plans go according to schedule, i''ll be married next june. i met "julia" when
    i was a senior at college. she was a junior. after i graduated, i drove down to

    go steady, then i gave her an engagement ring. one night julia called me from

    john). but she promised she would never go near him again. she called me several
    times after that to say that john was still "after her." but she didn’t want me

    fought him off. i told her i was driving right down there to have it out with
    him. but she begged me not to, saying they have a lot of mutual friends and she
    didn’t want any awkward feelings. she asked me to forgive and forget. here’s the

    i have just returned from another shopping trip frustrated and empty~handed. all
    i want is one good-looking dress that i can wear for an evening out. i would like
    to ask the american fashion designers: for whom are you designing? each other?
    certainly not for american women. i am a 41-year-old professional woman who has
    worked hard to maintain a trim figure. and i''d like to show it off a little.
    today’s designers make that hard; their fabrics are lovely. but the styles range
    from frumpy to ridiculous. i can find nothing without a biousy waist (intended
    to hide at least 20 pounds around the middle). and dresses with shoulder pads
    that make me look like a football tackle. whatever happened to the classic little
    cocktail dress whose shape approximates a woman''s figure? i''m boycotting the
    dress market until the designers come up with something worth buying. and i’ll
    bet i have plenty of company. threadbare but resolute in virginia dear threadbare:
    don''t give up. figure-flattering dresses can be found if you know where to look.
    specialty stores. boutiques and catalogues carry fashions for every kind of figure—and
    department stores have plenty. too. far-out trendy fashions may be current. but
    you don''t have to buy them. should shoulder pads overpower you, they can be modified
    or removed entirely. if you can''t find something that pleases you. buy fabric
    and a pattern and make your own. you can’t sew? so what? find a dressmaker who
    can. el'

    her a note saying that her suggestion of a $50 minimum for a gift was the maximum

    note, she called crying, “it was supposed to be a joke. i thought you had a better

    gift by ups, so i phoned her and told her i had given her that gift in good faith

    am the main beneficiary in his will. my concern is his 22-year-old daughter from

    left her a token inheritance, could she still protest? i love him very much and

    for several years a young woma (she''s now 29) has been coming t my home to trim
    my three poodles. she would drive to our place in the country after work. so i
    paid her very well, adding a generous tip. i always had a lovely dinner for her,
    and she enjoyed being with my husband and me. i''m 68, but the age difference
    didn''t matter—we became good friends. i was invited to her bridal shower. at
    ''first i hesitated. knowing all her friends were younger women. but i finally
    accepted. took an expensive gift and had a wonderful time. then came her wedding
    invitation. written across the top—in her own hand—was: "fifty dollars minimum
    for the gift, please." abby. i nearly had a stroke! i could not believe it. i
    studied it for a week. then wrote her a note saying that her suggestion of a $50
    mini— mum for a gift was the maximum in poor taste. and i would not be attending
    her wedding. '' when she received my note. she called crying. “it was supposed
    to be a joke. i thought you had a better sense of humor!" then she hung up on
    me. a few days later she returned my shower gift by ups. so i phoned her and told
    her i had given her that gift in good faith and was sending it back to her. i
    also said i had discussed her invitation with several friends who all agreed it
    was in terrible taste. again she said she thought i had a better sense of humor,
    and perhaps because i was in a different age group i took it wrong. abby. am i
    old-fashioned. behind the times and lacking in a sense of humor? or have good
    taste and manners gone out of style? poodle lover dear lover: good manners and
    good taste have not gone out of style. you cannot be faulted for reacting as you
    did. the poodle groomer''s so~called “joke" was tasteless and devoid of humor
    for any age group. .-.'

    i applaud “kath'' erine from georgetown. texas” for wanting to donate her organs

    to sign her donor form as a witness. . i was legally blind for several years until
    somebody unselfishly donated his corneas to an eye bank. i am now 25 years old
    and can see. the gift of sight was the greatest gift i could have received from
    anyone. but it happened only because someone gave a part of himself to improve
    the life of a stranger. whatever excuses katherine was given by family and friends

    went together for two months, then had to break up because his ex-girifriend told
    him she was pregnant with his baby. i was really upset when we broke up because
    craig and i really love each other. he just started calling me again and comes
    to see me quite often, and i''m getting attached to him again. his girlfriend

    is onlyr interested in the baby. he told me this himself and i believe him. my
    mother thinks i should stop seeing him. but i love him so much that would be hard
    to do. can he get custody of his baby after it''s born? what are craig''s rights.
    if any? his girlfriend is 16. what should i do? i’ve been reading your column
    every day for three years and‘i''trust you. abby. please help me. confused in

    who is pregnant. apparently he was "in love” with her. prior to her becoming pregnant,
    and‘ although his focus now is on the baby, he seems immature and unable to accept
    the responsibility for his aotions. craig needs ”counseling, and it is available
    for unwed teen-age fathers. your mother is right. you should stop seeing craig.
    i urge you to consult planned parenthood so you will not find yourself in the
    same position as craig’s ex-girlfriend. craig needs to learn self-control and
    birth control. a 16-year-old boy can become a father, but until he is able to

    in reference to letters about the unfairness of giving one gift to a pair of twins
    to share. i want to mention another version of “half-gifts" that is equally unfair.
    most children whose birthdays fall around christmastime receive combination birthday—christmas
    presents. a teen-ager can usually handle such disappointments. but it''s hard
    on a younger child. i’ve known people born in november, january and february who
    have received "combo" gifts because their birthdays were so close to christmas.

    dollars worth a lifetime of disappointing memories for a child? i’m 32 and i still
    have some resentful memories. december baby dear d.b.: this letter should shake
    up an army of gift-givers who have made a practice of giving “combo-gifts." you

    times (1923-current file); nov 20, 1985; proquest historical newspapers: los angeles
    times pg. g9 dear abby a great american smokeout to enc '' urage the quitters
    by abigail van buren dear readers: thursday will mark the ninth annual great american
    smokeout. an upbeat, good-humored. one-day campaign to encourage smokers to quit
    smoking for 24 hours—just to prove they can do it. the idea was conceived by the
    american cancer society, which insists that anyone who can live without a cigarette
    for 24 hours can quit forever. so. if you''re hooked on cigarettes (or cigars)
    and you really want to quit. why not start thursday—for just 24 hours? the following
    information may motivate you: according to dr. william g. cahan. attending surgeon
    at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center in new york, lung. cancer is the single
    largest contributor to the total cancer death rate. it accounts for 25% of all
    cancer deaths in the united states. it is estimated that 85% of all lung cancer
    cases are due to cigarette smoking. as a smoker, you are 10 times more likely
    to die of lung cancer man a nonsmoiger. this year there wlll be 98,000 lung cancer
    cases among men and 48.000 among women. of these. 87,000 men and 38,000 women
    will die of the disease. the number of women who will die of lung cancer is increasing
    at an alarming rate. breast cancer used to be the biggest killer for women—now
    it''s lung cancer! . a word about smoking-related diseases—emphysema, chronic
    bronchitis and heart disease. this year an estimated 350,000 will die from one
    of these. this total exceeds the number of us. deaths in world war ii; it is eight
    times as many peeple who die in automobile accidents. a congressional study has
    just reported that health costs from the adverse effects of smoking have reached
    a new high of $65 billion a year in increased medical bills and lost productivity.
    the loss in death and disability cannot be measured. (and how does one measure
    the amount of heartache. remorse and guilt suffered as a result of a preventable,
    self-induced tragedy?) what about secondhand smoke? is it actually damaging to
    nonsmokers to be in the presence of those who are smoking? according , to cahan.
    the answer is yes. fur'' thermore, studies reveal that the children of smokers
    are more prone to lung problems and allergies than children of nonsmokers. for
    years.i have beg''ged my, young readers, “if you smoke, quit now. if you don’t
    smoke, don’t start!" yet, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 kids light up for the first
    time every day. why? peer pressure. no doubt. “how about the rights of smokers?"
    you ask. or course they are entitled to smoke it they wish. but they will have
    to find a place where they can smoke to their hearts’ content without offending
    those who can’t tolerate it. “quitting cold turkey” is the hardest way to quit,
    but my readers have told me it’s the most effective, and in the long run, the
    easiest way. cutting down is less traumatic, but the temptation to smoke is often
    too powerful to resist while smoking just one, two or three cigarettes aday. ''
    those who are heavily addicted may require professional help to break the habit.
    so, if you''re hooked''on cigarettes or have been telling yourself that “one oi
    these days l''m going to quit," why not start thursday—for just 24 hours? it won''t
    be easy, but i can promise you, it will be the best thanksgiving present you can
    give yourself— and those who love you. the american cancer society has put together
    a wonderful book _ let, “how to stay quit through the holidays.” it’s free. pick
    one up at your local american cancer society office, or write for one, and please
    inelude a stamped, self—ad— dressed envelope. the address is in your telephone
    book. p.s. a favor, please? if you quit thursday even for 24 hours, i want to
    hear from you.‘ then write again and let me know how long you were able to stay
    clean. good luck. keep me posted. i care. problem? write to abby. for a personal,

    i hope the controversy about whether or not to put a leash or harness on children
    is not closed. because i want to add my 2 cents: i am the mother of three sons
    who were very active and hard to keep track of every second of the day. when my
    oldest son was 20 months old, i was awakened at 4 am. by the smell of smoke. i
    thought the house was on fire, so i jumped out of bed to find my son sitting in
    front of the fireplace in his rocker with his teddy bear, watching the fire he
    had started with a newspaper and matches he had taken from a can that had been
    stored in an upper kitchen cabinet‘ that''s when i decided that for his own safety
    and the safety of the family, i should buy a harness for him. he wore one until
    he was 4 years old and didn''t seem to mind at all. his two younger brothers were
    just as bad when it came to climbing out of their cribs, high chairs and car seats,
    so i also kept them in harnesses until they were 4. today all three boys are in
    the marines, and to my knowledge none of them bears any "emotional scars" from
    having been restrained in a harness. mother of three men. paris.texas dear mother:
    my mail ran better than 100-to—onc in favor of harnesses for children. to those

    my problem is my dad, who is 65. he''s not ashamed to wear bifocals, but he refuses
    to admit he can''t hear. yesterday, the telephone rang and it was only 10 feet
    away, and he didn''t even hear it! worse yet, he drives a car and can''t hear
    the siren of an ambulance or fire engine until it''s practically on top of him.
    when my brothers and i try to talk to him about this, he gets belligerent and
    insists there is nothing wrong with his hearing and we should mind our own business!
    our mother has given up. she just repeats everything two and three times and yells
    at him. if older people aren''t ashamed to wear glasses, why are they ashamed
    to wear a hearing aid? a loving daughter. dear daughter: that''s a good question,
    especially since some of the newer-model hearing aids are practically invisible.
    nagging will only make your father more defensive and irritable, but don''t give
    up trying to help him. ask his physician to insist on a hearing test as part of
    his next physical. my mail tells me that a surprising number of people who suffer
    a hearing loss turn a deaf ear to those who try to help them. vanity? insanity!'

    ok. i asked, ''how about weekends and holidays?'' his reply was, ''today is saturday
    and i''m working!'' i suppose he meant that unless your neighbors tell you which
    days they work and which days they want to sleep, 8 a.m. is ok. well, my neighbor
    saw me in the grocery that afternoon and she said she could have killed me, as
    she had saturday off and wanted to sleep, but my lawn mower woke her up. so what

    my husband and i just received a letter that threw us for a loop, and we don’t
    know what to do about it. it was from our daughter. married for a short time and
    living in another town. shé tells us that she knows we plan on giving her and
    her husband something for christmas, so if we really want to give them something
    they need. to give them the cash! she went on to say they don''t need "things,"
    but they are in debt and could use the cash to help pay off some of their obligations.
    we are. of course. distressed to learn that these newlyweds are so hard up. but
    our idea of a christmas gift is not cash. now we are sorry they were so frank
    with us. i think this was very nervy of them. a gift is one thing. but helping
    them pay their bills is something we had not planned to do. should we ignore their
    request and give them gifts as we had intended? or should we just send them a
    cneck to help pay off their bills? they both have jobs, if that will help you
    tell us what to do. can''t decide dear can''t: a gift is something one gives freely

    a letter telling them that putting themselves in debt is no way to start a marriage.

    “ed p. in richmond, va." proposed we honor bachelors by having a national bachelor‘s
    day. and you said. "if congress can approve mule appremation day, why not bachelor''s
    day!" abby. what have bachelors done to deserve any form of homage or appreciation?
    they do not necessarily sow, nor do they reap. how can their accomplishments be
    compared to those of the mule? the mule has justified its existence many times
    over. it has plowed our fields. provided us transportation (you wanna ride a bachelor?).
    pulled our borax ore. helped us through gold claims, and carried us down the deep
    slopes of the grand canyon. i was amazed to learn that the bill was sponsored
    in congress by robert garcia, who is not from an agricultural community—he''s
    a democrat from new york and lives in an apartment house in the bronx. barry v.
    in coral springs. fla. dear barry: several of rep. garcia''s constitu ents wrote
    to inform me that the mule appreciation bill was not sponsored by garcia. i stand
    corrected. but since it was passed unanimously, it''s safe to say that he did
    not oppose it.'

    i read your column only as an appeasement to my wife of 43 years. you and mr.
    ed of richmond may make light of mule appreciation day to honor the hybrid who
    did man''s bidding in the expansion of this country. but george washington felt
    differently, no doubt. when he accepted a pair of jackasses as a gift from king
    charles 111 on oct. 27. 1785. and started breeding the mule. i will gladly condone
    a national wives’ day to honor women who work like a horse (especially mine).

    a family? perhaps one day a year should be celebrated to recognize the importance
    of the jackass (four-legged and two ). and that w0uld cover everything. bill wadley.

    i have a sister-in-law i''ll call daisy. her father died eight years ago. at which

    us a gift. she makes a contribution to her favorite charily. we are also irked

    my mother-in-iaw and i disagree on something that will probably seem petty to
    you. but i really need to know who is right into which shaker should the salt
    and pepper go? doesn''t the salt belong in the shaker with the greater number
    (but smaller in size) holes in it? my mother-in-law says the pepper should go
    into that one. i think she''s wrong. she''s coming here for thanksgiving dinner.

    when she tells me i''m wrong? all shock up in philly dear shock: in our house,
    the shaker with the larger (and fewer) holes contains the pepper because the pepper

    tlmes pg. f4 dear abby some things to consider and to give thanks for by abigail
    van buren dear readers: by popular demand. here is my traditional thanksgiving
    column: thursday is thanksgiving day. so take a few minutes to think about what
    you have to be thankful for. how''s your health? n at so good? well, thank god
    you’ve lived this long. a lot of peopie haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands—maybe
    millions—are hurting more. (have you ever visited a veterans hospital? 0:a rehabilitation
    clinic for crippled children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear
    the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakf
    ast table on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise the
    lord! a lot of peopie couldn’t. how’s your pocketbook? thin? well. most of the
    world is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security.
    in fact. one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are
    you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, call someone.
    go out of your way to do something nice for somebody. it’s a sure cure for the
    blues. are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our system has
    been saved by such concern. concern for fair play under the law. your country
    may not be a rose garden. but it also is not a patch of weeds. freedom rings!
    look and listen. you can still worship at the church of your choice. cast a secret
    ballot and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head
    or a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a differént
    system. you are free to go. there are no walls or fences—nothing to keep you here.
    as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will want
    to use it at your table tomorrow: 0. heavenly father: we thank thee for food and
    remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank
    thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember
    the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service, that thy gifts to us
    may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving. and may god bless
    you and yours. love. abby rs. want an instant high? the surest cure for the post-holiday
    blues is to do something nice for someone. why not call someone who lives alone
    and invite him (or her) over for dinner or leftovers? better yet, call and say.
    “i''m coming to get you. and i''ll see that you get home." (many older people
    don''t drive. and those who do don''t like to go out alone after dark.) try it.
    and let me know the results. do you hate to write letters because you don’t know
    what to soy? mank-yw notes, sympathy letters, congratulations, how to decline
    and accept invitations and how to write an interesting letter are included in

    we read you in the midway driller. taft. calif. as residents in a nursing home.
    we hope you will run again your column on what to give older people for christmas.
    it made a lot of sense, and people will listen to dear abby. thanks from all of
    us dear all: here it is with some minor revisions: dear readers: can you believe
    it''s time to prepare for the holidays again? well, it is. so do yourselves a
    favor and do your christmas or hanukkah shopping early. if you''re wondering what
    to give aunt jennie or grandpa, who don''t go out much. let me tell you what not
    to give them: forget dusting powder. after-shave and cologne. (they probably have
    several unopened boxes gather~ ing dust on their closet shelves.) grandpa doesn''t
    need another necktie, and aunt bertha doesn''t really want any more brooches,
    necklaces, bracelets or earrings. with the price of groceries so high. older folks
    who live alone on a fixed income would be delighted to receive a basket of goodies.
    include small cans of salmon. chicken. ham, tuna, vegetables, fruit, instant coffee.
    tea bags. crackers, cookies and instant soup mixes. older peeple who live in confined
    quarters do not need more “things" that are ornamental only. don''t send music
    boxes, statuettes or other bric-a—brac. a truly thoughtful gift: post cards and
    some lined stationery with envelopes and a generous supply of postage stamps.
    (enclose some felt-tip pens too.) a handy gift: an assortment of greeting cards
    for all occasions, so that they. too, can send birthday, anniversary, graduation,
    get-weli and condolence cards to others. (be a sport and affix postage to some
    of the envelopes.) don''t give a gift of clothing unless you’re absolutely sure
    the size is right. that goes for color and style, too. if you''re tempted to pass
    along a scarf, purse, wallet or some little doodad you received three christmases
    ago. please don''t; the recipient will probably find it just as useless as you
    did. (besides, you might get it back the year after next.) if you are aware that
    someone on your gift list is living on a pension. a check for any amount would
    be much more appreciated than some useless little trinket. another thoughtful
    gift would be a year''s subscription to a newspaper or magazine you are sure he
    or she will enjoy. if you buy a gift on sale, be sure it''s appropriate, since
    if the recipient tries to exchange it, he will be told. “sorry, sale merchandise
    is not returnable." never give a pet to anyone unless you''re absolutely sure
    a pet is wanted and will be properly cared for. and if you want to delight someone
    who considers his pet a “member of the family," include a tin or two of cat or
    dog food for the pet. don''t give wine or liquor unless you''re sure the recipients
    imbibe. candy, nuts and fruitcake make wonderful gifts for those who aren’t counting
    calories, but please have compassion for those who are, and lead them not into
    temptation. also remember that many older people have difficulty chewing hard
    candies and nuts. and nutritionists caution: “lay off sugar and salt." instead
    of giving someone a gift with permission to “take it back and exchange it ifit''s
    not what you want." save yourself (and them) time and effort by giving gift certificates
    in the first place. holiday time can be very depressing for people who are alone,
    so if you know someone who might be alone and lonely. give him (or her) the best
    gift of all—an invitation to have a holiday meal with you and your reproduced

    several months ago, our 59-year-old mother-in-law had to quit her job to stay
    home and care for our father-in-law, who had a massive stroke that left him totally
    helpless. they have six married sons and 11 grandchildren—the youngest is 4 months
    old and the oldest is 10 years old. the folks are on a limited budget. so all
    the sons must help out financially. we wives can''t care for pop because he has
    no control over his bowels or kidneys, and we do not feel like that is a job for
    a daughter-in-law. we are also very busy with our own families. we don’t mind
    our husbands helping their parents with money, but we think mom should repay the
    favor by keeping our kids every weekend. it would give each one of us a “vacation"
    from our kids every six weeks. our husbands don''t think their mother should be
    obligated to baby—sit. but we do. after all, we are obligated to give them $20
    a month. what do you think? dot in georgia dear dot: your mother-in-law already
    has her hands full caring for her invalid husband. and to expect her to baby-sit
    every weekend is the height of insensitivity. if you daughters-in-law need a vacation

    a question of ethics with regard to abortion: to whom is the family physician
    more responsible, the parents or the teen-ager? we sent our 16—year-old daughter
    to our trusted family physician for a complete physical. i phoned beforehand to
    ask that he include information on birth control because i suspected our daughter
    had made the decision to become sexually active. although she and i had talked
    about this from time to time, i didn’t want to make it appear that i condoned
    the pill at age 16. a month later, she promptly became pregnant and our doctor
    recommended an abortion clinic. we learned about this months later from an evil
    girlfriend out for some schoolgirl revenge. i feel betrayed by our physician and
    the medical system that can’t come up with a better solution than the "no-snitch
    rule” when treating teen-agers. sold out in maliibu dear sold out: the “no-snitch
    rule" was designed to protect teen-agers, the theory being that minors would not
    go to a public health or family planning facility for information and/or treatment
    for vd, birth control or any sexual concern if they thought their parents would
    be informed. ideally, parents build a relationship with their children when they
    are very young, so their children will feel comfortable discussing every aspect
    of sex before they even consider becoming sexually active. unfortunately, even
    the best of parents seem unable to talk to their children about sex. you are to
    be commended for sending your daughter to a physician and asking him to include
    information about birth control. perhaps he did, but it was either too late, or
    she didn''t follow his advice. i’m sure the "no—snitch rule” has saved many teen-agers
    from venereal disease and unplanned pregnancies. (many have told me that they
    would rather commit suicide than go to their parents with such problems.) so please
    don’t feelbetrayed by the doctor. he did what he felt was in your daughter’s best

    a child''s toy on the floor. “if we go to a restaurant. please read the menu to

    i have been a housewife for all our married years, never having held a job outside

    i found my way back, identified my attacker and pressed charges. we went to court,
    and he is now serving five to seven years. he was up for parole once and was denied.
    my problem: at the time of the attack, the police took all my personal belongings
    for evidence—including the‘ jewelry and clothes they took off me in the hospital.
    they told me i couldn’t have anything back until after the case was over. after
    the jerk was sentenced, i asked for my things and was told i would have to wait
    until the case was appealed. next they tell me that the case has to be typed up,
    the judge must read it, sign it, then it must be filed. they said they “lost”
    my things. two months later they found everything. i have been calling them once
    a month for three years, and i still don’t have anything back! i keep getting
    one stall after another; they say the courts are very busy now, and i will have
    to wait. ok, now that i have explained my predicament. i would like to forget
    this ugly incident once and for all, but i can’t get it out of my mind until i
    get my things back. can you help me? fed up in con n ecticut dear fed up: yes.

    you are always on your soapbox about cigarette smokers fouling the air. well.
    how about all those people who put on so much perfume, you could gag? everywhere
    you go lately you''re practically asphyxiated by the fragrances. it''s bad enough
    when women bathe in perfume, but now that men have also taken to smell— ing pretty,
    a person needs a gas mask to keep from fainting. you can edit this any way you

    this is the time for family get~togethers that will present a problem i don’t
    know how to handle. i am 30. with two small children, and when igo home (i live
    in another town), i''m treated like i''m still 14 years old. my brothers and sisters
    (all older than me). and my parents, too, keep telling the same stories about
    how dumb, fat, sullen and miserable i was as a child. they all laugh like it was
    one big joke—and abby. those were the most painful years of my life. i am an adult
    now and want to put those painful memories behind me, but how can i when they
    keep repeating the same stories every year? oh, i''m a good sport and laugh right
    along with them, pretending it doesn''t bother me. but it does. my husband just
    hates it when they bring up stuff that hurts my feelings. he doesn’t care too
    much for my family for this reason. i try not to let these things get to me. but
    it gets harder every year. and i now dread going home for the holidays. is there
    a practical solution? anonymous. please dear anonymous: yes. speak to each brother.
    sister and parent individually, explaining that you no longer want to be reminded
    of those painful memories. your husband''s support in this matter will be very
    helpful. state your objections firmly. and unless they’re being deliberately cruel,
    they will respect your wishes. if they persist. it is your right as an adult to
    absent yourself from future family get—togethers. d'

    it was wonderful to see my late father’s poem. "the man in the glass,” in print
    again. i am happy to identify the author. he is dale wimbrow. that poem was printed
    initially in the american magazine in 1934 as the response to a young boys question,
    "does it pay to be honest?" i find it hard to understand how a person could claim
    the work of another. especially when the theme is "honesty.” over the years, ”the
    man in the glass" has gained wide popularity. it was copyrighted in 1934, but
    appeared numerous times as a poem whose author was unknown. my father has written
    a lot of poetry. he also founded the indian river news in sebastian, fla., a weekly
    publication that won the first editorial award ever presented by the florida press
    assn. sally wimbrow, sebastian, fla. e] confidential t0 r. n .: to put it another
    way, i saw a bumper sticker in harrisburg, pa.. that read: “make love, not war—but
    be prepared for both." reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. further

    my older brother recently married a divorced woman with a 10-year-old daughter.
    my brother has always been attracted to little girls. his stepdaughter (i''ll
    call her mary) is well-developed for her age. lately she''s been asking for a
    lock for her bedroom door. this is all she requested from her grandmother (my
    mother) for christmas. i don''t like to think bad things about my brother. but
    i have bad feelings about the whole thing. you hear so much these days about adults
    molesting kids. should i ask mary any questions? she doesn’t seem to like to be
    alone with my brother. i once saw mary in such a depression (no one noticed it
    but me), and when i asked her what was wrong, she nearly burst into tears. i feel
    helpless. but i want to help her if there is something wrong with the family situation.
    to give you a little background about my brother: he has lived with many women
    before (all with little girls). he spent a lot of time with an uncle who was caught
    molesting his young nieces. please tell me how to deal with this. or should i
    mind my own business? if my brother is guilty and i bring it out in the open,
    i''m afraid my whole family will hate me. ’ i don’t want to give my name, so please
    answer in the paper. i will be reading you faithfully every day looking for an
    answer. heartsick in maine ‘ dear heartsick: if a child is being molested, it’s
    everybody''s business. and if your whole family hates you''for exposing a crime
    and rescuing a child, don’t let it bother you. try to get closer to mary. win
    her confidence, and let her know that you care about her and want to be her friend.
    if your suspicions are correct. confront your brother ''and tell him that if he
    does not get into specialized counseling for child molesters immediately, you
    will turn him in to the police and the proper authorities. do not let this go
    another minute. if you feel incapable of handling this situation yourself, please
    write again and give me your brother’s name and address, and i will handle ''it.

    when a person .checks into a hospital, there are forms to fill out and questions
    to answer. one question ”i prefer not to answer is about religious preference.

    question asked rou tinely? just asking dear just: many patients enjoy being visited
    by a member of the clergy of their own faith, and this is the way the visiting
