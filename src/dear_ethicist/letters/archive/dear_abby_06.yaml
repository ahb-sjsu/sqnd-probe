  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    "losing mine" wanted to know how women feel about balding or bald men. "can a
    man without hair be considered sexy, handsome and a hunk?" he asks. here is one
    woman''s view: baldness is not a "loss"-it''s a change. forget the toupees and
    transplants. the expense, pain and anxiety over strong winds are worse than any
    change in appearance. and whatever you do, don''t try to cover your baldness with
    foot-long wisps of hair parted an inch over one ear and draped around the head
    as many times as it will go. this looks ridiculous, fools no one and is the subject
    of more notice, derision and comment than baldness could ever be. gentlemen, please
    accept yourselves as you are-the way millions of bald men and those who love them
    do. laurie mitchell, wichita, kan.'

    i want to answer "losing mine": i''ve never seen hair on my husband''s head except
    in pictures. he was bald at 31 when i met him, and it didn''t make one bit of
    difference to me. if a man needs a hairpiece or a transplant for himself, fine,
    but if he''s doing it for the ladies, he''s wasting a lot of money. any woman
    who would reject a man because he''s bald isn''t worth having. i''m married to
    a handsome, sexy hunk. and his hair doesn''t tickle my nose when he sleeps with
    his head on my shoulder. to me, he''s not really bald. he just has more face to
    kiss. who needs hair in chicago?'

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    what do you think they''re talking about over here? the balance of trade situation?
    the technological competition with the united states? the value of the yen versus
    the dollar? come on. people in japan are like people anywhere else. they don''t
    spend their time discussing the issues that make the front page of the newspapers.
    instead they talk about . . . well, why generalize. let me give you a few examples.
    in nearby singapore ("nearby" is a relative term; singapore is a lot more nearby
    japan than it is nearby, say, south dakota) . . . blew that sentence. let''s start
    over. in nearby singapore, if a person forgets to flush a toilet, that person
    could be fined. apparently this has become a major problem in singapore-people
    are glad to use the toilet, but are too busy to flush it. so government health
    inspectors have been sent out to monitor the public toilets, and to issue fines
    to men and women who forget to flush. and the newspapers are dispatching reporters
    out into the streets to find "toilets of shame." the "toilets of shame" are then
    included on a "roll of dishonor" published in the papers. there is even a singapore
    telephone hot line-a special number that people are invited to call to complain
    about unflushed toilets in shopping malls and restaurants. the offenders are then
    made public. anyway, that''s what a lot of japanese people are talking about-the
    toilet situation over in singapore. also, japanese citizens seem a little concerned
    about the famous japanese work ethic. the catalyst for this was an event that
    was anything but humorous. an american baseball player who was the star of a japanese
    team was fired because he refused to leave the side of his seriously ill 8-year-old
    son, who was receiving medical treatment in the u.s. a newspaper columnist, wayne
    graczyk, wrote, "in japan, the job comes first, the family second." another commentator,
    noboru akiyama, said, "the foreigners drop everything if something happens to
    their families. if it was a japanese (baseball player), he wouldn''t stop playing
    even if his mother or a family member died in the middle of a game." in fact,
    in a recent survey among japanese schoolchildren, the question was asked: "what
    is most important to you?" the majority of the children listed computers and other
    such items. parents-and especially fathers-were way down the list. so in japan
    they''re talking about that. and they''re talking about things that many people
    in the united states might be able to identify with. advice columnist michiko
    fukazawa-sort of the japanese equivalent of our ann landers and dear abby-received
    a letter signed by "miss r.," from the city of kanagawa-ken. "miss r." wrote that
    she was a third-year high school student, and wanted to know "what to do about
    my relationship with my mother." she wrote that "a while ago my father was forced
    to shoulder a large debt. because of this debt, both my parents were required
    to work. from that time, their relationship soured. because my mother was exhausted
    after working all day, i became a target for her anger." the girl wrote that "when
    i take a big breath, my mother scolds me, saying, ''why are you sighing?'' one
    time when i had put my books neatly in order, she reproved me, saying, ''why are
    you throwing books away?'' " the sad tale got worse. "miss r." wrote that "if
    i don''t do the housework, she reproaches me, asking why i didn''t do the cleaning.
    i detest my mother completely, and nowadays can''t even share a conversation or
    laugh with her." in short, "miss r." felt awful because of the way her mother
    was treating her. michiko fukazawa-the advice columnist, remember?-advised "miss
    r." not to "take the cruel words your mother says to you seriously. it is your
    mother who has a problem for thinking as she does, and not you. . . . as you will
    be graduating from high school in a little over a year, try your best to make
    plans to live independently in the future. and polish your good qualities so that
    people will see you as a wonderful person in your own right." so here in japan,
    as everywhere in the world, it''s not the front-page news that people are discussing
    at the dinner table. it''s the toilets in singapore, and the survey saying that
    schoolchildren respect computers more than parents, and the complaints of a high
    school girl with a mean mother. that''s what they''re talking about. that, and
    the persistent rumor that elvis presley is alive and living in yokohama . . .

    i have never written to you, but want to tell you how i handled being ignored
    on my first mother''s day. my husband also said to me: "you''re not my mother!"
    (i was the mother of his adorable twin daughters, however.) the following mother''s
    day, i bought for myself a lovely pair of diamond earrings "from the twins," using
    my husband''s credit card. i wrapped them prettily and set the package out with
    a card, and with great fanfare presented it to myself in front of the babies and
    hubby. after i unwrapped it, i ran to the phone and called my mother and the rest
    of my relatives and friends to tell them of this wonderful "gift" i received for
    mother''s day, adding with each call that i couldn''t imagine how my husband was
    going to top this for next year! when he realized that he had paid for this costly
    gift, he changed his tune, and since then he has not missed one mother''s day,
    birthday or anniversary for the past 20 years. he correctly figured it was the
    cheaper way to go! gotcha! in illinois problems? what''s bugging you? unload on

    day gift, stating: "you''re not my mother." i, too, went through that for many
    years, and felt hurt until i read a letter in your column that said: "my husband
    never remembers anniversaries or special days. he seldom brings home gifts, but
    he''s a hard worker, doesn''t run around, he''s there when i need him, he''s a
    good father, takes us places, spends his days off with his family, and who could
    ask for anything more? his giving of himself far outweighs any gift he could buy
    me." i have never complained-nor have i ever forgotten that letter. j.b., independence,

    for telling him he was not weird or abnormal. here''s my story: when i was 10

    for five years i was with a wonderful man i''ll call "g." we got along very well
    and, despite several setbacks, we seemed perfect for each other. we even talked

    state, and we saw each other only twice in all that time. each visit was wonderful.
    we kept in touch, though it was very hard to be so far apart. over christmas this
    past year, g. came to visit me. it was great seeing him again, but we had grown
    apart, and the whole visit was rather strained. to save myself the pain of having
    him break it off, i did it first. since then, i''ve tried to forget him and see
    other people, but it hasn''t worked. i miss him terribly. so, i called him last
    week and we talked for a long time. i told him i wanted to come to see him, but
    he said he''d been living the bachelor''s life for the last couple of months and
    that several people wouldn''t like me to be there! he meant "women," and i could
    die from jealousy. i wrote to him, just to keep in touch. he didn''t answer my

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    mark shields is a political columnist and analyst and a commentator for network
    television. politics and journalism have in common that they are both occupational
    activities without any fixed professional standards for admission to their ranks.
    that''s not the case with a more selective profession, such as nursing or real
    estate. by simply announcing you are a pol or a writer, you can become one-or
    both, as we can see from this summer''s political conventions. among those american
    politicians with press passes doing commentary at atlanta were former senators
    gary hart and tom eagleton, former 1988 presidential candidate bruce babbitt and
    former vice presidential nominee geraldine ferraro. these midcareer switches were
    achieved, republicans will be thrilled to learn, without any federally subsidized
    job training program. all this raises a question: if american politicians can
    become media types, shouldn''t american media types be eligible for lateral transfer
    into the political and governmental world? simple fairness demands reciprocity
    between the two occupations. consider some interesting possibilities: william
    buckley writes books and columns. on his weekly tv show, he has elevated slouching
    to an art form. a single government job would hardly be enough for a man with
    such a full schedule. for buckley, a yachtsman and a yalie, a dual appointment:
    leadership of both the federal maritime commission and the federal panel on (quintessentially)
    select education. columnist carl rowan''s output is also prolific. a heavily in-demand
    public speaker, rowan offers his analysis on a weekly tv show. to the next administration,
    he represents an ideal match between the man and the assignments: director of
    the arms control and disarmament agency and chairman of the subcommittee on water
    and power. for 25 years, columnists rowland evans and robert novak have been the
    nation''s most enduring unbalanced ticket. on his television shows, robert novak
    is the unchallenged master of the snarl and scowl school of uncivil dialogue.
    bob novak at the peace corps would make about as much sense as gonzo journalist
    hunter thompson would at the food and drug administration. sam donaldson, the
    abc white house correspondent, is an equal-opportunity tormentor of chief executives,
    as jimmy carter and ronald reagan would willingly testify. a cabinet post could
    await donaldson. the best for the next president would be to name sam secretary
    of either energy or housing and urban development, high positions with low profiles.
    (anyone who can name the last three secretaries of both departments is probably
    smart enough not to admit the fact.) in a period of fiscal belt-tightening it
    could be necessary to lower the bureau of standards. who better to handle that
    assignment than morton downey jr. or geraldo rivera? the backlog in our federal
    courts could be unclogged by the imaginative nomination of a unique american journalist
    to the bench. endlessly wordy decisions and memoranda now consume too much time
    to write and to read. but what about either dear abby or ann landers on the court?
    decisions and judgments would be succinct and a pleasure to digest. to the undeserving
    appellant: get lost, buster. to the unwitting plaintiff: wake up and smell the
    coffee, mac. finally a judge would throw out illegal wiretaps with a single reproach
    to the prosecutors: mind your own business, charlie. of course, charles kuralt
    would make sense as federal highway commissioner. top show host john mclaughlin
    could ably lead either amtrak or the subcommitte on hazardous wastes and toxic
    substances. and fresh from its exclusive that elvis is alive in chillicothe, ohio,
    where he chairs the dukakis-bentsen campaign, the washington bureau of the national
    inquirer could easily handle either foreign affairs or public affairs. the press
    box fairly brims with qualified appointees to the bureau of prisons or the bureau
    of mines. the press has been generous and hospitable in opening its ranks to expatriates
    from politics and government. not it''s time to return the favor.'

    grandma created quite a stir among your readers concerning her usual $50 birthday
    gift to her selfish descendants who, after a while, thought they had it coming.
    did you know that it is a legally established fact that the practice of voluntarily
    giving gifts over a period of time implies an obligation to continue that practice?
    several years ago, when the mills of the american rolling mill co. in middletown,
    ohio, were really rolling, the company, out of the goodness of its corporate heart,
    began giving free turkeys to its employees at thanksgiving. then the company fell
    on hard times, and in the early 1980s it decided to discontinue the distribution
    of some 15,000 turkeys as an economy measure. the steelworkers union set up a
    howl and took the company to court. believe it or not, the court took the position
    that through the company''s generous practice over a period of years, it did indeed
    owe the employees their thanksgiving turkeys! small wonder they call them "gobblers"?

    this is in response to the letter from the postal employee who thinks that a 2
    percent error rate is not a bad record. that kind of attitude is ruining america.
    a 2 percent error rate is completely unacceptable! how safe would you feel if
    2 percent of the aluminum used to make our airplanes was flawed, or if one car
    in 50 was a lemon, or 2 percent of the answers in your column were wrong? no errors
    are acceptable! i attended a conference recently at stanford university titled
    "manufacturing in the ''90s." george fisher, president and ceo of motorola, stated
    in his keynote address that his company now counts defects a few per million,
    and by 1992 hopes to be counting defects per billion. the goal is 99.997 percent
    defect-free product. if america''s manufacturing industry condoned even a fraction
    of a 2 percent error rate, it would have even more problems than it has today,
    and would soon cease to exist. i submit that the u.s. postal service should rethink
    its quality program or its future may be very tenuous. abby, this is what we can
    expect if 99 percent is "good enough": - at least 200,000 wrong drug prescriptions
    each year. - more than 30,000 newborn babies accidentally dropped by doctors/nurses

    as an 18-year-old teenager, i would like to say something to all the kids in america,
    like myself, who smoke. when i first got into this rotten habit, i had no idea
    how uncontrollable the urge to smoke would get-and everyone out there who is a
    smoker knows exactly what i mean. the main reason i am speaking out on this subject
    is because of a note my mother, who is a heavy smoker, left in my room when she
    discovered that i smoked. she didn''t yell or lecture me. she just left a short
    note for me to think about. thanks to her, i realized that endangering your life
    is not only stupid, it is avoidable, and if there are other moms out there who
    cared as much as mine did, many teens would learn a valuable lesson. here''s mom''s
    letter: "dear sue: as a person who is addicted to cigarettes, i would like to
    stop, but i am powerless to do so. please, stop smoking before it''s too late!
    "your dad will bury me, because smoking does shorten one''s life. "did you ever
    take a good look at my face? i look much older than i should at my age, and i
    can thank cigarettes for this. i am not writing this as your mother, but as a
    cigarette smoker who knows that the habit starts with one cigarette at a time,
    then you get hooked and can''t do anything about it. love, mom" abby, please print
    my mom''s letter. maybe someone else will realize that life is too precious to
    throw away, and quit smoking. sue duffy, philadelphia'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    media-wise, this is going to be a tough campaign for barbara bush. her competition
    for first lady is kitty dukakis, who has quite a juicy story to feed the press:
    26 years of drug addiction and the possibility of being the first jewish first
    lady. how can barbara bush, that nice, warm, grandmotherly woman we''ve seen standing
    in reception lines for eight years, possibly compete for press attention? "well,"
    says barbara bush, arching an eyebrow, "the drug addiction was to diet pills,
    and i can''t do anything about not being born jewish. that''s not my fault." and
    then there''s the way the press is playing up mike and kitty dukakis'' relationship
    as though it were the love affair of the century. he mouths "i love you" to her
    at the democratic convention and holds her hand during interviews. george bush''s
    mother had to remind him that it would be nice if he let his wife exit first from
    airplanes. "we''re private about those things," barbara bush says. "maybe it''s
    more of a great love affair to be married for 43 years to the same person and
    really love them and not have to wear it on your sleeve. maybe that''s what love
    is all about." from the tight way she holds her mouth as she says it, bush leaves
    no doubt that to her, that is indeed what love is all about. leave the lovey-
    dovey stuff to the democrats. barbara bush is what she is: 63. sturdy. white-haired.
    (more about that later). handsome. (that''s the word that reporters, struggling
    for an adjective to describe a woman who dares not to be glamorous, have unanimously
    settled on.) organized. (her christmas gifts are already ordered: nearly 1,000
    of them for aides and friends who go back to her days as a newlywed.) loyal. (when
    a friend was having a baby, far from home, bush charged into the hospital, announced
    herself as the closest living relative and kept the woman company.) she''s funny,
    in a self-deprecating way. (in her standard political speech, she tells of recently
    standing next to her husband and having a photographer yell at the lady in the
    red dress to get out of the picture. she looked down, and in a horrible flash
    realized he was referring to her.) she''s frank. (it was she, don''t forget, who
    called democratic vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro a "$4 million
    . . . rhymes with rich" during the 1984 campaign.) she''s a warm, likable, no-nonsense
    woman. in some ways, she''s a dinosaur. she may be the last wife of a presidential
    candidate who gives interviews discussing how she likes her sheets (pressed) and
    her petit fours (coated in pastel frosting) and how she feels about doilies and
    tablecloths at tea parties (doilies, yes; tablecloths, no). she has spent her
    life as a homemaker, making 28 homes in 17 cities during 43 years while her husband
    kept switching jobs: businessman, congressman, ambassador to the united nations,
    chairman of the republican national committee, envoy to china, head of the central
    intelligence agency and vice president of the united states. she has devoted her
    life to the care and comfort of her husband and five children and has few regrets.
    "my life hasn''t been too bad, either," she says, sitting in the magnificent four-storied,
    gabled vice presidential residence in which two sets of guards check you in and
    servants bring iced tea decorated with fresh mint. "i''ve loved my life. i''ve
    had a very good, very selfish time. but have i thought about my children, worried
    about them, cared about them? of course. and my husband. and i don''t think i''ve
    given up one thing." - sixteen-year-old barbara pierce of rye, n.y., met 17-year-old
    george bush of greenwich, conn., at a christmas dance. he asked for an introduction
    to the girl in the red-and-green dress. she still hasn''t asked him why. all she
    knows is that she laid eyes on a man she describes to this day as "the handsomest
    i ever saw: 6 feet 2 inches tall, eyes of blue," with the "kindest, sweetest face."
    the next night he went to another dance looking for her and invited her to watch
    him play basketball. her entire family turned out. besides his blue eyes, she
    fell in love with what she calls his "caring." "his mother used to call him ''have
    half'' because he always offered half of everything he had. give him a banana,
    and he''d say, ''do you want half?'' " three years later she dropped out of smith
    college to marry him. after 43 years of marriage, she still gets gushy. "to know
    him is to love him, honestly," she says. "isn''t he good-looking?" she asks. "she''s
    his biggest fan," says their daughter, dorothy, 28. it''s not many women who can
    say along with barbara bush, "i married the first boy i ever kissed." - barbara
    and george bush both come from prominent, wealthy families, though she says she''d
    like to lead an expedition to her family home to show that it was not the estate
    that people think it was, just because her father was president of the mccall
    corp., the publishing concern. after marriage, life was treating them well: george
    was prospering in the oil business, and they had three children. then they faced
    every parent''s nightmare: their daughter was sick, and she wasn''t going to get
    better. robin bush died of leukemia in 1953, a few months short of her 4th birthday.
    "seventy percent of people who lose a child get divorced in the first or second
    year," barbara bush says. "it either breaks you or it strengthens you enormously.
    we worked well together. i was very strong when the child was sick, and then i
    just absolutely collapsed. george could barely look at her when she was sick-it
    killed him so, he loved her so, as did i-but i just made up my mind that no one
    was going to cry in front of her. she was going to be happy until it was over.
    and then i just could not face it. and george just put his arms around me and
    made me share and talk to him about it, and he made me see people. he would not
    let me go." losing her daughter made bush cling to the two children she had left,
    george and the infant jeb. "i wouldn''t let them out of my sight. one day i heard
    little george say to a friend, ''i''m sorry, mike, i can''t play with you. i have
    to play with my mother.'' and then i realized what i was doing to that poor little
    child." eight months after the death, barbara and george bush were in so much
    physical pain that they had checkups. they assumed they must have caught a bug,
    hanging around the hospital so much. the doctor told them they were fine; the
    pain was just heartache. bush is still a devoted mother. her son marvin, 31, had
    his colon removed after a bout with colitis last year-the hospital vigils brought
    back "enormous shades of those awful days in the hospital" to her-and marvin has
    become a spokesman for people with similar problems. abigail van buren (advice
    columnist dear abby) sat next to him recently when he was about to address a group
    about his experience. as he got up to speak, he turned to her, pointed to a small
    tape recorder and said, "would you please press this when i start? my mother wants
    to hear it." carol vander jagt, the wife of u.s. rep. guy vander jagt of michigan,
    has known barbara bush since their husbands came to congress together in 1967
    (bush as a representative from texas). every christmas, a group of friends get
    together for lunch, to exchange gifts and to discuss the last year. "when it''s
    barbara''s turn, all she talks about are her children and her grandchildren, not
    a word about her husband being vice president. those are the things that are important
    to her." there was a time in her life when it seemed like maybe those things weren''t
    enough. "for a while, you were made to feel like you were nothing (if you didn''t
    have a career)," barbara bush says. "for a brief period, when all the children
    were gone and george worked in the cia, i felt i should be doing something. the
    women''s movement made me feel i had done nothing, but that was wrong. "i''ve
    always been an active volunteer, and my husband had always shared with me when
    he could and made me feel needed. but for a while, i didn''t. now i feel as though
    the children have to be a priority. i''m one of the few people i know whose children
    all got married-to the opposite sex-had children and stayed married. knock on
    wood." and yet she impressed upon her daughter, dorothy, how important it was
    for her to finish college. "she always wished she had," dorothy says. - after
    43 years together, barbara bush says george bush is still "fabulous, fabulous"
    company. "we read, we eat dinner on the porch, watch the evening news, talk about
    the news." two of their children say they''ve never seen their parents quarrel.
    son george, 42, describes their relationship as "idyllic." son marvin says that
    politics has strengthened their marriage. "when you''re in the public eye, you
    end up relying a disproportionate amount on your family. i traveled with my father
    the other day, and when i got off the airplane, an aide said, ''you lifted your
    father''s spirits tremendously by being here.'' well, that''s what my mom can
    do on a consistent basis. reggie jackson once said he was the straw that stirs
    the drink for the new york yankees-that''s a good way to describe my mom in my
    family." "she provided a center," says janet steiger, chairwoman of the postal
    rate commission, whose husband also came to congress with george bush. "she gave
    him tremendous stability. with five kids, and him running around the world, moving
    from place to place, that was incredibly important. that was a great gift to him.
    it enabled him to sail into some very choppy seas." what did george bush give
    his wife? their children, all of whom are working in the campaign, say "love,"
    "strength," "support," "security." and yet, at times, he appears to be almost
    indifferent to her. she says he never noticed when her hair turned white, never
    noticed when she started to dye it, never noticed when she stopped. in his autobiography,
    "looking forward," published last year, their wedding gets one sentence. most
    references to her are of the "barbara and i lived here," "barbara and i lived
    there" variety. in 255 pages, he devotes not one paragraph to the woman with whom
    he has spent more than four decades. in the fallout of the gary hart scandal,
    george bush was the target of rumors about "other women." barbara bush chose to
    deal with them publicly through humor. "how can george bush have an affair?" she
    asked. "he can''t stay up past 10 o''clock." her son neil, 32, said he thought
    the republicans floated the rumors to add a little muscle to his father''s image.
    when asked about the rumors today, she calls them "malicious, vicious, ugly untruths"
    and dismisses them. "i don''t want to talk about it because it isn''t true." for
    a longtime political wife, bush has a remarkably thin skin. "she always advises
    me not to read the papers, but she does, and i do too," dorothy says. "sometimes
    it can be brutal." subjects barbara bush would rather not discuss: the "wimp"
    factor, her hair, her wrinkles. bush can''t understand why the world does not
    see her 195-pound husband as the war hero and tower of strength that she sees.
    she knows he doesn''t come across well on television, so she blames television.
    her hair-short, white, wispy-is another subject bush would prefer to skip. she
    calls it "boring," though it has been the subject of national press, political
    consultants and so much mail that she has two form letters, one she sends to people
    who like it, one she sends to people who don''t. she dyed it for years and hated
    it. it turned every color but the brown she wanted it to be, it felt awful and
    it restricted her lifestyle. "you couldn''t run your hand through it, and george
    sort of liked to run his hand through it. i had to go to the beauty parlor twice
    a week. i used to have to say, ''i''m sorry, i can''t do this, i just went to
    the beauty parlor.'' i don''t have to do that anymore. i exercised this morning
    and washed my hair. i like that. that''s how i want to live my life." another
    nonsubject: the way some people assume she''s george bush''s mother. "i can''t
    do a thing about it," she says. "people are so mean," dorothy says. "i think it''s
    the cruelest, meanest thing anyone could say. she''s a beautiful person. she accepts
    herself, and we''re proud of her. . . . of course, it bothers her." "george bush
    sees me through the same eyes he used 43 years ago," barbara bush says. "he doesn''t
    see me as i look today." people have called barbara bush her husband''s not-so-secret
    weapon in the campaign. she has become a confident public speaker who disarms
    a crowd with her warm, self-effacing manner. "people are always coming up and
    saying nice things about my mom," neil says. "it''s not that they don''t like
    george bush, but they love barbara bush." when she talks about her interests,
    especially literacy, she speaks from the heart. neil was dyslexic as a child,
    and he says his mother suffered through his reading problems with him. "she was
    always there. she kept my spirits boosted when i wasn''t feeling so great about
    myself." "it was never a case with my mother of, ''oh, let''s find a project for
    barbara bush,'' " dorothy says. "she''s involved with the same things she was
    involved with before my father ran for president." if her husband is elected,
    bush intends to continue to work for literacy, leukemia research, the homeless.
    she''ll work hard to see that he wins. but if he doesn''t? "would i fall on my
    sword? absolutely not. i''d be heartbroken for a week at the most. when you''ve
    had children who''ve been sick or who''ve died, life gets put in much better perspective."
    and then, barbara bush sees one advantage to her husband not getting elected:
    she can return to her garden, "while i can still bend." caption: photo (color):

    i am writing to thank you for an article you printed in the cleveland plain dealer
    in september 1987, telling your readers that the salvation army could help them
    find long-lost relatives. i immediately wrote, asking if they could locate my
    niece whom i had not seen since she was 13 weeks old. stella, who was named for
    me, was the only child of my brother, harry selavko, who was killed in world war
    ii. the salvation army sent me a form requesting specific information to help
    them in the search. i filled it out and mailed it promptly. i heard nothing for
    10 months. then out of the blue, i received a telephone call from a woman in austin,
    texas. she said, "hello, stella? this is stella." i nearly fainted! the salvation
    army had found my niece. she is now 45 years old, and the mother of three! stella
    said she was thrilled to know that someone in her father''s family had taken the
    trouble to look for her, because she had always felt that her father''s family
    didn''t care about her. abby, it''s a long story, but while my brother was overseas,
    his wife fell in love with another man, so she wrote harry a "dear john" letter,
    asking for a divorce. however, the divorce never materialized because harry was
    killed before he could answer her letter. his daughter, stella, who was 14 months
    old at the time, never knew her biological father or any member of his family.
    i am especially grateful because i am 66 years old, and have survived two cancer
    operations. my prognosis is good, but through it all, i kept praying that i would
    live long enough to find my niece so i could tell her about her father and his
    family. i hope and pray that in the future we can meet in person. we have a lot
    of catching up to do. thank you, abby, for all the good you do. may god bless
    you. stella gurkovich, cleveland'

    smile and who will ask (loudly), "how come you''re so quiet?" if just one quiet

    the dallas cowboys, once america''s team, are now herschel''s team. herschel walker
    wonders about that. "it''s strange," he said before the cowboys broke training
    camp here. "they haven''t given me any stock or anything." credit is what they
    gave him. herschel walker is so good the cowboys could afford to get rid of tony
    dorsett and imagine themselves better off. dorsett, now with the denver broncos,
    is the fourth-leading rusher in national football league history. at 34, he still
    has the speed that separates him from most backs. except herschel, no. 34, age
    26. walker is faster than dorsett. they haven''t raced lately, but walker is faster
    than almost anyone. not just anyone in football. anyone alive. maybe bo jackson
    could beat him. maybe dorsett. washington cornerback darrell green beat him in
    the nfl fastest man series, but that was in a 60- yard dash. at the nbc superstars
    competition, walker beat willie gault at 100 yards. "beat darrell green and willie
    in a hundred," walker said. "but it doesn''t really matter. just my day. another
    day, they would beat me." what matters is that walker can stay close. at 6 feet
    1 inch and 225 pounds, not even the world-class sprinters can embarrass him. so
    when herschel''s team practices monday night against the bears, in irving, tex.,
    on national television, dallas fans see it as a team that is improving fast. already
    against the chargers and the raiders in exhibition games, the cowboys have scored
    48 points. in all four preseason games last year, they scored 36. and herschel
    has yet to catch a pass. he will. the cowboys think no. 1 draft choice michael
    irvin can be a star receiver, but walker will be split wide at times, too. he
    is the only nfl player to gain more than 700 yards rushing and receiving during
    the last two seasons. herschel the versatile does not limit himself to sprinting,
    running and catching. he is the only nfl player besides gault to participate in
    the ballet. he performed in april with the ft. worth ballet in a piece choreographed
    by paul mejia, who had choreographed gault with the chicago city ballet. walker
    studied ballet for a semester at the university of georgia. and did tony dorsett
    ever challenge mike tyson to a fight? "i said i wouldn''t talk about this during
    football season, but i heard him say he was the best athlete in the world and
    then he said he''s the best boxer," walker said. "i said i would like to challenge
    him. people took it and just blew it all up. "i''d do it. it wouldn''t scare me.
    everyone is scared to do this, scared to do that. things don''t scare me. i''ve
    walked in the path with the lord jesus christ all my life, so things don''t scare
    me. so i''d like to do it because i''m a competitor. "during the off-season, if
    it comes up again and tyson says he''ll do it, i wouldn''t back down. i''d love
    to do it." why not? just because walker isn''t a boxer . . . "i never cared about
    boxing until during the olympics i watched a little bit," walker said. "i''ve
    seen (tyson) and i said: ''this guy is great. i love tyson.'' and i said, ''i''d
    love to compete against him.'' "people say, ''why don''t you challenge him in
    a race?'' that''s not the field i want to challenge him in. i want to challenge
    him in his field. i do a little boxing, but i do more martial arts. i just said
    i''d love to do it. people just blew it up like i''m ready to jump into the ring
    now. i said i''d love to do it sometime. i never said right now." walker hates
    limitations more than he loves boxing. the football field, the track, the stage,
    the ring are all too small for walker''s imagination. he''s part country preacher,
    too. "i want to do many things," he said. "i want to show people how much the
    lord has blessed my life and given me the ability to do more than play football.
    i ran track when people said a guy herschel''s size is not supposed to be able
    to run that fast. but see, i don''t know that. my mind doesn''t know that. "one
    thing little kids should never listen to is that you can''t do this. there''s
    no such word as ''can''t'' as long as you try, as long as you''re happy with what
    you''ve done." walker won his second overall title in the superstars competition.
    he won the 100 in 9.39, was second in the half-mile in 2:15.09, third in basketball,
    second in tennis, third in weightlifting, second in the bicycle race and ninth
    in the obstacle course after clinching the title over track''s renaldo nehemiah.
    when looking ahead to this season, walker first looks behind. the cowboys knocked
    off the rams and the cardinals in last season''s final two games while playing
    a lot of young people. "we got a taste that if we go out and play hard we can
    accomplish anything," walker said. coexisting with dorsett was not a problem for
    walker, he said. "i don''t think tony had a problem, either," he said. "we loved
    it, because it gave each of us the opportunity to take the pressure off each other.
    people forget neither one of us was ever healthy enough together so we could work
    on anything together." writing is another of walker''s talents. with help, he
    is doing an advice column for kids. "sort of like a dear abby," he said. "i did
    a book on physical fitness and got a positive response." walker does not hide
    his opinions. on food: "i eat one meal a day. when i was in georgia growing up,
    my parents worked all the time. my family realized when you eat lunch or take
    a break, you miss out on things. you don''t need that much food. so many people
    pile in food because they think they''re hungry." on workouts: "the biggest part
    is mental. so many people talk about losing weight. you can''t lose weight if
    you don''t believe you''re going to lose." on drugs: "so many kids go around and
    look at people on drugs and think they''re cool. there''s nothing cool about that.
    i can be rich, have all the money in my pocket, have the biggest car, the biggest
    house, but if i only live 15 years, that stinks. i tell people i''m going to live
    150 years and then i''m going to decide to turn old." but he''s herschel walker
    and you''re not. "people say it''s easy for me to say because i''m gifted," walker
    said. "but as a little kid i didn''t have that talent. i didn''t have that will
    to go out there and fight. i made my mind up. this is life. this is reality. this
    is the only world we''re going to live in. so you''ve got to make your mind up
    right now you''re going to work. "i had no athletic ability, but i started working
    out. sometimes you''ve got to get up early when you don''t feel like it. i remember
    watching my mother and father get up before it ever got light and come back and
    it would still be dark. they never complained. that''s all i know. there''s nothing
    cheap in life. "i''m never going to say i''m perfect. i make a lot of mistakes.
    but i don''t sit and linger on those mistakes. you''ve got to keep going, keep
    pushing." caption: photo: ap laserphoto. the cowboys rely on herschel walker,
    who says, "if we play hard we can accomplish anything." illustration photo'

    i''ve been dating a man for nearly a year. we are extremely attracted to each
    other, enjoy each other''s company and generally have a lot of fun. he''s a great
    guy in most respects and has professed his love for me. we have even talked about
    marriage. the problem: there are discrepancies between his actions and his words.
    some examples: he told me that he was dating only me, and i found out that he
    had been dating others. his excuse: "i was dating a lot of girls when we met,
    and i had to let them down easily." he told me he was going to work out at his
    health club one evening. i later learned that he and his old girlfriend went to
    her mother''s house for dinner. he told me he was going to a football game with
    "some guys." i found out he took his old girlfriend. (he keeps telling me that
    the relationship with her is strictly platonic, but i''m not so sure.) he can''t
    undestand why i don''t trust him. he accuses me of being insanely jealous and
    in need of counseling. i''m 30 years old and have had two long relationships-one
    for two years, and the other for six years. both men wanted marriage, but i wasn''t
    ready-or in love enough. i love this man i''m dating now enough to marry him,
    but i''m having problems with his "platonic" friend and his propensity for half-truths.
    i would appreciate your advice. what to do?'

    if you can solve this, you will be helping hundreds of organizations that raise

    books and the choice items at rock-bottom prices. the public never even gets a

    bring in the customers? this year i saw a museum-quality book of poetry "sell"
    for a dollar-before the sale started. i once baked and decorated a gorgeous cake
    for my club''s bake sale to raffle off. i''m sure they could have made $25 from
    it. it was snapped up by the head of the bake sale committee-for $5. i raised
    this issue once and got the cold shoulder. abby, the only organizations i know

    my problem is a couple of years old, but it still bothers me. i have a sister
    and a brother. all of us are married and only a few years apart in age. a couple
    of years ago, my mother had two very nice rings. one was her engagement ring from
    our father, and the other was her own mother''s ring. my mother asked my sister
    to choose the ring she wanted, then mother gave my brother''s wife the other one.
    i was overlooked completely. to make matters worse, my mother told everyone involved
    not to tell me. (i found out from a relative who didn''t know it was supposed
    to be a secret.) i am very hurt because my mother chose my sister-in-law over
    me to give something important to. the ironic part is that my sister-in-law and
    my brother are now getting divorced-and there goes the ring! every time i see
    my mother, i think of this ring business and feel hurt and resentful. i avoid
    going over to see her. i don''t know what to do. i have two faces-one feels guilty
    for not showing my mother the affection and attention a daughter should, and the
    other one can''t seem to get over the hurt i feel. it''s not really the ring;
    it''s the idea that i was passed over in favor of my sister-in-law. what should

    a mother dressed up her 7-year-old son like a pig, made him sit on the front porch

    pig nose taped to his head. she hung a sign around his neck that read, "i am a

    i''ve been in the u.s. navy for 13 years. last year i was a navy recruiter. my
    brother''s son was considering joining the navy when he graduated from high school
    last year. it is a well-known fact in our family that this nephew is a sleepwalker,
    so i told my brother and his wife that their son was not enlistment-eligible.
    his mom asked me to "overlook" the fact that her son was a sleepwalker, and i
    told her there was no way i would jeopardize my navy career and her son''s life
    by overlooking something like that. if my sleepwalking nephew were to join the
    navy without acknowledging that he was a sleepwalker, he could very well sleepwalk
    right over the side of his ship at sea, or if he were assigned to an aircraft
    carrier, he could walk into a piece of machinery and get killed. furthermore,
    if it became known that his recruiter knew of his condition and suppressed it,
    the recruiter could be court-martialed. my nephew was all for keeping his sleepwalking
    a secret, but i would have no part of it, so he''s not in the navy. my conscience
    is clear and i know i did the right thing, but my family has been very cool to
    me and my wife, and we feel terrible about this. now i hear that this sleepwalking

    i have an aunt who has been very close to me all of my life. she is nearing 80.
    about 15, maybe 20 years ago, auntie gave one of her nieces a large wooden table
    when she got married. since then, the couple has divorced. the niece has moved
    to another state, and her husband has remarried. auntie has asked me to get in
    touch with the ex-husband and ask him to send the table back to her! abby, my
    aunt has no room in her small apartment for this table. when i reminded her of
    this, she said, "i don''t care-and i will give it to the goodwill if i have to!"
    when i told my aunt that i would not feel comfortable calling this man and asking
    for the table and suggested that she call her niece and let her handle it, auntie
    said, "i''ll remember that you refused to help me when i needed help." she hurt
    me by this remark and left me totally confused. this aunt has always said, "if
    i give you something and you don''t want it, don''t give it away-give it back
    to me." if you were in my place, what would you do? puzzled in buffalo'

    this is in response to the letter from "rushed to death," whose husband was always
    in a hurry. when my husband and i read the letter, we howled with laughter because
    it accurately described him. after years of trying to change him, i realized that
    the only person i could change was me. so i told him that we could go shopping
    together, but if he was going to rush me, i''d stay home and save myself aggravation.
    i then used the time i would have spent shopping to do something i enjoyed. if
    he wants to eat fast-let him-just make sure that he doesn''t eat off your plate.
    since you know he doesn''t like to wait in line for anything, find places to go
    that don''t require waiting in line. we often go to 5 o''clock movies and eat
    only in restaurants where we can make a reservation. i will admit there are some
    advantages to being aggressive, pushy and in a hurry. my husband is the guy who
    gets on an airplane first so he can get all the room he needs to store our carry-on
    luggage in the overhead bin. we are the people who get the best seats in the house
    for a movie because he pushes to the front of the line. when i do go with him
    to the supermarket, he scouts out the fastest checkout counter. if he goes too
    fast, i just say, "you go ahead, dear-i''ll catch up." i hope this helps. roberta

    i strongly disagree with the doctor who told his patient, "if you don''t quit
    smoking, you can find another doctor." would a real friend say, "stop smoking,
    or find another friend"? of course not. i am a physician. some of my patients
    smoke. i know that smoking is not good for them, and so do they, but i''m their
    friend as well as their physician and i care about what happens to them. smoking
    is an addiction-one of the worst-and it''s very difficult to overcome, so i do
    everything within my power to help them quit. i take the sympathetic approach.
    i say, "my friend, i know how hard it is for you to quit smoking, but you are
    a strong person and i have confidence in you. we are in this together. if you
    don''t quit smoking, there is a good chance that you will develop cancer, and
    i don''t want that to happen to you. the best way to quit is cold turkey, so set
    a date, and with your strong willpower, i know you can beat this thing!" abby,
    most of them quit. and when they do, my whole office rejoices, and the patient
    feels like a real winner. if the smoker backslides, i try various other methods:
    stop-smoking clinics, support groups, nicorette gum. but abandon my patient-never!
    you were right when you said, "no doctor wants to lose a patient one way or the
    other," but you were wrong to applaud that doctor for his "courage and professional

    as the man hurried away. he looked inside the wallet long enough to see that there
    was more than $2,000 in it. john chased the man, caught up with him, and handed
    him his wallet. the man looked bewildered, didn''t say a word, not even a "thank

    he told them he kept none of the money, and the man didn''t offer him any reward.
    everyone told john that he was "nuts" for being so honest. none of them said they
    would have given the money back-let alone the wallet. when john came home and
    related this story to us, my husband and i told him he did the right thing. the
    guests in our house said he was "crazy" to give the money back. later, his friends

    and told my mother that there was the cutest boy in my class," she says. in the
    first place, he was 6 feet 2 inches. "i was 5 feet 9, and the girls were wearing
    higher hats then, so i needed someone tall," she says. violet was very shy, but
    something came over her a week later. she was coming out of a freshman meeting
    in the pouring rain, and she turned around and asked the tall, handsome stranger
    if he wanted a ride. he and a friend hopped into her mother''s 1922 oldsmobile.
    "i can just see him in my mind coming down the stairs and getting in the car,"
    she says. "when he introduced himself and was such a gentleman, i knew then and
    there this was the man i wanted to spend the rest of my life with." three or four
    weeks after they met they went to a fraternity dance and dated steadily for a
    year. then harry''s father died, and harry, who was religious, entered a year
    of mourning. parties and movies were out, so violet, who was only 19, got bored
    and decided to forget him. "i went out with a lot of men, but none of them compared
    with harry," she says. he didn''t forget her either. on valentine''s day a 3-pound
    box of candy arrived with a not very subtle note: "i hope this will sweeten you
    up a bit." it did. violet arranged to attend a party where she knew he''d be.
    they got back together and dated steadily for three years. they were married in
    the fall of 1927. violet and harry never went anywhere without each other. every
    day between 11:30 and noon she would call him to tell him where she was and that
    she loved him. they spoke again every afternoon at 3 or 3:30. they exchanged presents
    every year on the anniversary of the day they had become engaged (march 19). he
    never forgot a special occasion. "i was reading in dear abby that a lot of husbands
    don''t give their wives presents on mother''s day because they''re not their mothers,"
    violet says. "well, let me tell you, harry always did." they never had an argument.
    both of them were easygoing, violet says. their lives were active and full. they
    had a 50th-anniversary party, attended by friends and family from all over the
    country. on their 80th birthdays, only 10 days apart, their daughters gave them
    a beautiful brunch at a hotel. they were talking about how wonderful it would
    be to have another party for their 60th anniversary. then harry died. they had
    been married 59 1/ 2 years. after harry died, violet, who is almost 83 now, went
    through his things. she found a picture of herself as a 4-year-old girl in his
    wallet. she also found, neatly folded, a note her mother had written him in 1937,
    along with a check for his birthday. and she came across her autograph book from
    freshman year at college. eight months after they began dating, harry scribbled
    in that book that they had been the happiest eight months of his life so far.
    "i was a most fortunate and lucky wife to have all those years of happiness and
    good health," violet says now. "so today, as the saying goes, ''one can collect
    antiques and precious possessions, all very perishable and fragile, but wonderful
    memories are something we always have." violet is very grateful for her years
    of loving memories of harry. but no matter how full her life was, how much love
    she stored up for 59 1/2 years, it is hardest for her at around 11:30 every morning;
    that was when she would be making her first call of the day to harry. ----------

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    as the elderly woman tentatively steps from her car to the driveway, lee linklater
    knows the woman is struggling with a familiar problem: a stray cat has "just taken
    over" at her home, chasing her own cat and generally being a nuisance. can the
    stray join the other felines already in residence at linklater''s crystal lake
    home? linklater plays her part as a pet lover''s dear abby well. she tells the
    woman that she''s unable to take in another cat but assures her: "they''re just
    going through an adjustment period." the woman nods and says with a disappointed
    sigh, "if he''d only get along with peewee, i wouldn''t mind. . . ." many people
    do mind, and they solve the inconvenience by dumping stray animals and even their
    own pets. that''s where linklater steps in. the founders of a nonprofit animal
    welfare group called the assisi animal foundation, she and her mother, isabelle
    yarosh, share their own 10-room home with 152 cats and 8 dogs, many of them abandoned
    by their owners. "we''re keeping real good company," linklater says, listing winston
    churchill, gandhi, pythagoras and others who have befriended animals. linklater''s
    idea of an animal shelter is nothing new, of course; organizations such as the
    90-year-old anti-cruelty society in chicago have long been caring for abandoned
    animals. and several no-kill groups often care for such animals until they die
    naturally. care package what seems to set her apart is the packaging: when a permanent
    shelter next to linklater''s home is finished, it will be a formal pet retirement
    farm complete with brochure and a free pickup system within 100 miles of the shelter.
    perhaps an inevitable spinoff of the pet cemetery, pet retirement is aimed at
    people who can no longer take care of their animals. typical clients of linklater''s
    program would be like the first two cats informally admitted. "in both cases,
    they''re very old, and the owners had become allergic to them," linklater says.
    given the age of the cats, "adoption and placement under normal circumstances
    would be a very, very remote possibility." as with any retirement center, though,
    "their owners come and visit them once in a while," she says. for an annual fee-or
    one-time fee-not yet determined, linklater''s shelter will take care of a pet
    for the rest of its natural life. the program won''t officially start until the
    permanent shelter is completed. assuming that volunteer help and donated materials
    allow the shelter to be finished, crystal lake eventually will become host to
    what apparently will be the midwest''s first retirement home for pets. there is
    a sanctuary for beavers in upstate new york, one in california for horses and
    one in san antonio for monkeys and their relatives, called primarily primates.
    that''s according to people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), one of
    the largest animal-rights organization in the country. "what they''re doing is
    pretty unique, according to what we have in our files," says carol burnett, speaking
    for peta. the assisi foundation, also prefers "companion animal" over "pet." while
    chiefly acting as an animal shelter and adoption organization, is a no- kill group
    that supports animal-rights stances, including a ban against the use of animals
    in laboratory experiments. animal rights not too many years ago, such groups were
    considered a bit kooky, but that is changing as scholars and others get involved
    in the issue. for instance, the lead article in the august issue of harper''s
    magazine is a dialogue titled "just like us? toward a notion of animal rights."
    one of those included in the harper''s forum was arthur caplan, director of the
    center for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota. referring to linklater''s
    pet-retirement program, caplan says, "i like the idea of an arrangement that would
    allow people not to abandon or kill pets because their lifestyle or health does
    not allow them to keep them." still, he adds, "i wouldn''t want to see enormous
    amounts of social resources go to pets when we don''t do too well with human retirement.
    abandonment is the real ethical scandal." lee linklater doesn''t have time for
    ethical debates. she''s too busy feeding, treating and otherwise taking care of
    the 160 cats and dogs inhabiting more than half of her house. despite the numbers,
    the house is kept relatively clean by daily scrubbing and disinfecting. also,
    all of the animals, which go through 30 pounds of dry food a day, are groomed
    and checked for ailments each week. and every one of them has its own medical
    card and name-from clyde the enormous greyhound to mellie, a chihuahua dwarfed
    by most of the cats. pausing before the screen door of a basement room that is
    packed with cats, each with its own milk-crate "condominium," linklater says,
    "that''s what we lovingly call the main room." this wasn''t supposed to be an
    animal house. linklater, a chicago public school teacher, and her mother, both
    veteran city-dwellers, moved to crystal lake two years ago to make room for a
    shelter. the permanent shelter next to their home was to have been completed by
    now. then in march the original contractor for the shelter quit, saying that the
    internal revenue service had frozen his accounts. meanwhile, mchenry county building
    and zoning officials discovered building violations. linklater''s foundation has
    charged the contractor with breach of contract in a complaint that soon will be
    amended to include fraud, because "the amount of work done was totally substandard,"
    says the foundation''s attorney, bill hellyer. volunteers help the shelter is
    being completed with the help of volunteers and several businesses, including
    unity electric, a crystal lake firm that donated labor and materials to install
    the building''s electrical system. volunteers also help with the foundation''s
    "pet therapy" program, in which animals are taken to local nursing homes. to keep
    the foundation going, linklater looks for support from its members, which have
    grown in number to 400 since the organization was founded in 1983. it was named
    after francis of assisi, the 13th century italian saint known for his love of
    animals. - caption: photo: lee linklater (left) and her mother isabelle yarosh

    until the completion of a permanent shelter (above), more than half of linklater''s
    10-room home has been turned over to the cats-and eight dogs-cared for by the
    assisi animal foundation. illustration photos 3'

    abby, here it was 24 hours before mother''s day and she flatly refused to help
    me out. needless to say, my mother received a belated gift. soon after, my sister''s
    birthday rolled around, so i called my mother and asked if she would kindly get
    my sister a birthday gift. she graciously agreed to. later she told me she bought
    a rather expensive bottle of wine for my sister and i immediately sent mom a check.
    my sister never acknowledged the gift. abby, am i unreasonable to feel annoyed?

    may i reply to a reader''s comment regarding the unprofessional behavior of some
    "office nurses"? most physicians'' "office nurses" are medical assistants. those
    who act in an unprofessional manner are usually hired off the street by physicians
    who do not want to pay for qualified, educated medical assistants. the american
    association of medical assistants (aama) has been in existence for more than 20
    years and has been working for the education and certification of assistants.
    certified medical assistants (cma) are given similar education in handling delicate
    patient situations and law and ethics as registered nurses. the medical assistant
    must complete two years of training, which includes 90 hours of internship in
    a physician''s office. she must pass a nationwide certification exam that tests
    her knowledge in the administrative, clinical and general aspects of the medical
    office. cmas must also earn continuing education credits in order to keep their
    certification. i hope this explains why some "office nurses" behave in an unprofessional
    manner. j.m., cma, royal oak, mich.'

    three years ago i divorced a man who had little time for me and our 2-year-old
    daughter. the one serious relationship i had since my divorce recently dissolved,
    and now my ex-husband has been avidly pursuing me. he patiently waited for me
    during my love affair and was there to pick up the pieces. now he wants to remarry
    me. he has been to counseling and is sure that we can make a go of our marriage
    if he has another chance. what is the success rate of your readers who have remarried
    spouses they once divorced? i am very much interested in the response this may

    i''d like to respond to "c.b. in phoenix," who faced the dilemma about what to
    do with brandy and spice, the two cats who became old and sick. find a new home
    for them? or put them to sleep? first, cats have a strong sense of place. having
    lived for so long with you, they would very probably be disoriented and unhappy
    if they were moved into a strange environment at their age. second, if you, who
    loves them, can''t cope with their illness, what makes you think someone else
    can? if someone does impulsively take them, then finds the task of caring for
    them impossible-what then? (i have learned from sad experience that there are
    a lot of people who simply put old cats out, even though the cats have lost what
    ability they had to fend for themselves.) the thought of "putting them to sleep"
    may be painful, but having done it once, i would not hesitate to do it again.
    our big cat, riley, was not only old, he was dying of leukemia. we cared for him
    lovingly, but when his pain became too intense, we took him to the vet who had
    cared for him for years. i held riley in my arms so he would not be upset or frightened
    (never mind how hard i was crying at the time) while the doctor gently administered
    the fatal injection. riley laid his little head against my hand, and slowly stopped
    breathing. there was not a twitch or quiver. he was neither hurt nor frightened.
    of course, we missed our old friend for a long time, but i felt good about having
    spared him a painful, lingering death. i hope when my time comes, it will be as
    easy. nora in little rock'

    about your "tips" on tipping: how do you figure a bartender should get only 10
    percent? a bartender not only must serve the drink, but concoct it. a bartender
    is supposed to listen to people''s problems, entertain them and be aware of who''s
    had "enough." in between mopping up spills, cleaning ashtrays and slicing up fresh
    fruit, the bartender is expected to remember each customer''s drink, and what
    garnish he or she prefers. (the gentleman likes two olives in his martini; the
    lady wants one onion in hers.) i hardly think 10 percent is enough, but i''d gladly
    settle for that, as about half the customers "forget" to tip us. my advice: tip
    the bartender at least 10 percent for excellent service. also, if you can''t afford
    to tip, you really can''t afford to go out, so do us both a favor and stay home.

    i''ve been a mail carrier for a year, and after hearing so many complaints about
    the postal service, i would like to air a few of my own to the public: - why isn''t
    your house number clearly visible on your mailbox or on your house? - why is your
    mailbox hidden behind bushes and fences? - why do you park in front of your mailbox
    when your driveway is empty? - why is your dog out roaming the streets? - when
    you moved, why didn''t you file a change of address with the post office, and
    also send individual change of address cards to your utility and credit card companies,
    your magazine subscriptions, banks, etc.? - why do you send mail with incorrect
    addresses (i.e., incomplete street numbers, no apartment/suite numbers, misspelled
    names, etc.)? - if you''re tired of getting the previous tenant''s mail, why isn''t
    your name on the mailbox so that the carrier knows who lives there? normally,
    a regular carrier has memorized several hundred names of residents and businesses
    on his route. however, a new carrier, or even an experienced carrier unfamiliar
    with a route, cannot be expected to know all these names. unlike the regulars,
    we substitute carriers take much longer to sort out, route and deliver the mail.
    we do not always have the time to check carefully the forwarding lists to see
    who has moved. supervisors constantly pressure us to work faster and carry more
    mail than we can handle, in order to avoid having to pay us overtime. we cannot
    perform 100 percent under such stress. i am not passing the buck. the postal service
    needs to improve. however, before people criticize the postal employees, they
    should make sure that they haven''t contributed to the problem. thank you. california

    i want to express my opinion on the big controversy about whether we should keep
    "the star-spangled banner" as our national anthem or change it to "america the

    a great pride in our country. it reminds me of the struggle our forefathers had
    to gain freedom and keep it. all i feel when i hear "america the beautiful" is
    a sense of disappointment because our country doesn''t match the words. when i
    hear "amber waves of grain" and "the fruited plains," all i see are farmers going
    bankrupt and more and more of our property being sold to foreign investors. our
    "spacious skies" are so polluted already, they pose health risks. our "purple
    mountains" may still be majestic, but how long will they remain that way with
    logging and mining and encroaching civilization bringing more pollution? and "crowning
    our good with brotherhood"? with all the violence, crime and racial inequality,
    it seems hypocritical. also, all the offshore drilling and spills, as well as
    dumping of sewage into our lakes and oceans, make "from sea to shining sea" ridiculous.
    even though "the star-spangled banner" may be more difficult to sing, we should
    not consider changing it to "america the beautiful" until we clean up our act

    i come from a very large family-lots of aunts, uncles and cousins. we get together
    quite often because we all live within a few hours of each other. last may, we
    had a big family wedding, and that''s when my first cousin and i realized that
    we were very much in love with each other. when we were growing up, we had a crush
    on each other, but we never expected it to lead to marriage. i think we were both
    fighting it because first cousins weren''t supposed to get married. well, at this
    family wedding we had to face our true feelings. abby, we have so much in common,
    and we cannot deny that there is a very strong physical attraction between us.
    we have not gone all the way, but we are getting very close to it. (i am 24, and
    she is 21.) if we should decide to marry, can we get married in iowa, nebraska,
    minnesota, south dakota, illinois or wisconsin? if not, in which nearby state?

    for years, i used to shoot birds-just for sport. i am enclosing the poem that
    convinced me to give up that sport. some people may think the poem is "corny,"
    but it had a powerful effect on me. i came across it in the chronicle, in crested
    butte, colo. it was written by lem ward crisfield, m.d. disarmed in wisconsin
    a hunter''s poem a hunter shot at a flock of geese that flew within his reach.
    two were stopped in their rapid flight and fell on the sandy beach. the male bird
    lay at the water''s edge and just before he died he faintly called to his wounded
    mate and she dragged herself to his side. she bent her head and crooned to him
    in a way distressed and wild caressing her one and only mate as a mother would
    a child. then covering him with her broken wing and gasping with failing breath
    she laid her head against his breast a feeble honk . . . then death. this story
    is true though crudely told i was the man in this case. i stood knee deep in snow
    and cold and the hot tears burned my face. i buried the birds in the sand where
    they lay wrapped in my hunting coat and i threw my gun and belt in the bay when
    i crossed in the open boat. hunters will call me a right poor sport and scoff
    at the thing i did. but that day something broke in my heart and shoot again?

    you frequently advise readers to seek "professional help" when they are confronted

    a devastating situation. therefore, i wonder how you feel about the public outcry
    that automatically condemns any public figure who has sought such help? do you
    consider them wise for having sought professional insight into their problems,
    or do you think that those of us who have recognized this need in ourselves must
    forever bear the brand of being "emotionally unstable" and likely to break down
    under stress? it seems to me that this is a vital concern for our time, not only
    when it comes to our choice of leaders but in our personal lives as well. must
    the people who follow your advice to seek counseling make up their minds to accept

    hired a lawyer to protect our son''s rights. the welfare department said our son
    had to take a blood test in order to determine whether he was the father or not,
    then he had to wait until the baby was 6 months old to make sure that nothing
    went amiss with the blood tests. well, sure enough, the blood tests proved conclusively
    that our son was not the father! abby, how can the welfare department put just

    he says, "i believe a man and woman can be ''just friends'' as well as lovers."
    abby, what makes a man think he can be physically intimate with a woman, and be
    "just friends"? i do not have sex with my friends. i keep telling him that if
    a person is "just a friend," then sex is not even in the picture. am i old-fashioned,
    crazy or correct in my thinking? ''just friends'''

    i have read many letters in your column from people who say they cannot forgive.
    what they really mean is, they will not forgive. withholding forgiveness hurts
    only you. it can eat you alive. i want to tell you what i was able to forgive,
    in hopes that it will help people who are harboring petty grudges to forgive and
    get on with their lives. lee and i have been married for 10 years. last year he
    became completely burned out at his job and also suffered a severe back injury.
    i was expecting our fourth baby, and we had another family sharing our home. all
    this created a very explosive atmosphere, and lee flipped out. our baby was born
    and developed mononucleosis at 3 weeks. lee announced that he didn''t love me
    anymore, and he left me. the other family moved out suddenly, and i was alone
    with a sick newborn and three other small children. i couldn''t eat or sleep.
    i lost 47 pounds, got hooked on tranquilizers and had a nervous breakdown. lee
    came back, put me in a mental hospital, then proceeded to have an affair with
    my best friend of 10 years. (the affair lasted four months.) while i was in the
    hospital, my best friend''s husband broke into our house and caught his wife and
    lee in bed together. he told lee that he could have her-then lee and my girlfriend
    became "engaged." they told me later that they had planned to drive me to commit
    suicide so i would be out of the way. after i was released from the hospital,
    lee tricked me into a false reconciliation. two hours after making love to me,
    he stood me up at the airport and took his girlfriend to florida. meanwhile, my
    kids were aware of everything that was going on, and my 7-year-old kept begging
    me to shoot him in the head because he didn''t want to live anymore. it was terrible.
    we lost our home, so the children and i moved into my parents'' attic with no
    heat-during a pennsylvania winter. suddenly lee came to his senses and broke up
    with his girlfriend. her husband forgave her, and she went back to him and their
    three children. and guess what? i forgave lee and took him back. i got counseling,
    went to church and kept reading my bible. i''m off the pills, am eating normally,
    and our family is intact. we got our house back, lee is totally repentant and
    we have restructured our lives to avoid anything that could be destructive to
    our family. two weeks ago, i went to my girlfriend and told her i forgave her.
    we cried together and talked for six hours. forgiveness, when it is least deserved,
    has true healing powers. in forgiving her, i released her of all guilt, and now
    god is able to work in my life. i still feel a little insecure at times, but i''m
    much better today than i was six months ago. a life filled with thoughts of revenge
    and bitterness is no life at all. abby, if you think this letter will help others
    to forgive, you have my permission to print it with my name. donna stewart, hilltown,

    i do agree with "irritated in colorado"-but the problem actually refers to how
    all women (not just teenagers) are addressed. to call a young woman "honey" is
    tantamount to calling a young man "sonny boy," and i don''t think you would do
    that. not too long ago, a friend and i, both in our 60s, were greeted by a clerk
    with, "what can i do for you girls today?" this is patronizing and demeaning.
    in a doctor''s office, i was waiting for my appointment with a man also about
    60. the receptionist said to him, "you may go in now, mr. smith," but when my
    turn came, she said, "the doctor will see you now, marilyn." i always correct
    these people gently but firmly. often they are surprised because they had not
    even realized that this is a subtle kind of put-down. actually, i would like to
    see all forms of address more formal when people are acquainted only in a business
    or service situation. first names and pet names are fine for friends and family
    because they denote an intimacy. however, i resent it from strangers. lyn venable,

    for the first time since she was born, my 11-year-old daughter needs something
    from me that i can''t give her. she''s started to ask a lot of questions about
    how her body is changing, some new feelings she''s experiencing, and how to get
    a boy she likes to notice her. when i was her age, i had the same questions in
    mind, but i didn''t have the nerve to ask my mother. i''m glad my daughter feels
    close enough to me to ask, but i''m not comfortable enough to give her any answers.
    besides, i''m not even sure i know the right answers. i suppose i should consider
    myself lucky. she says some of the "older" girls are talking about birth control!
    abby, will you please steer a mother in the right direction? trusting you. dear
    trusting: it may be to early for your daughter to ask about birth control, but
    it''s not too early to get help from planned parenthood. in more than 800 planned
    parenthood centers across the country, highly trained professionals do a lot more
    than just provide birth control. they have a variety of educational programs for
    parents and children to help them discuss sexual issues in an open, comfrotable
    manner. they also may have educational counseling programs just for parents, and
    others just for teens or pre-teens. you also may be interested to know that most
    planned parenthood clinics, in addition to providing birth control, offer medical
    services and testing, counseling and/or refferals for: pregnancy, infertility,
    sterilization for women and men, abortion, sickle cell anemia, cancer, aids and
    other sexually transmitted diseases, hypertension, diabetes, vaginal infections,
    prenatal care and menopause. in other words, in many prts of the country, planned
    parenthood is a "one-stop" for fmen and women of all ages. a little-known fact:
    planned parenthood does exactly what its name implies. it not only helps couples
    prevent having babies they are not ready for, it helps couples with fertility
    problems, so that they can have the babies they want. the cost? only what you
    can afford to pay. nobody is turned away because he or she is poor. call planned
    parenthood today. it''s listed in your phone book.'

    i love music-songs float around in my head day in and day out, and it doesn''t
    bother me. once, it was different, though. i simply could not turn it off! after
    my dentist filled two teeth next to each other, i started hearing tunes i was
    not familiar with. i thought perhaps i had heard them in my sleep. upon retiring,
    i heard "singin'' in the rain" from beginning to end-the movie, that is! singing,
    dialogue, the works. i awakened my husband and asked if he could hear anything.
    he said, "no." he came to the conclusion that those two new fillings in my teeth
    acted as a receiver. we checked the tv guide, and sure enough, "singin'' in the
    rain" was the late movie! i didn''t need to turn on the tv, as i was hearing the
    whole thing. after the movie, i heard two policemen speaking to each other on
    their cbs. i looked out of my window and saw two patrol cars parked outside-one
    in front of the other. i heard every word they were saying to each other. it was
    a sleepless night! i got an emergency appointment with my dentist the next morning,
    and i told him my story. he laughed and insisted that this was not possible. however,
    after filing between those two newly filled teeth, the weird noises, music and
    voices stopped. smart husband-dumb dentist, huh? geri mcbeth, denver'

    this concerns "making it legal," the woman who had been living with her boyfriend
    for 11 years, had two children with him and a third on the way. she said she had
    always dreamed of a big church wedding, but her family thought a quiet, intimate
    wedding with family and friends would be more appropriate under the circumstances.
    you agreed with her family. then you were bombarded with letters saying, "you
    were wrong-why shouldn''t she have the kind of wedding she''s always dreamed of?"
    so you flip- flopped. you blew it, abby-you were right the first time! the sad
    fact is, we are living in a tasteless society. people accept invitations and don''t
    show up. others fail to rsvp, then show up bringing extra guests! also, there''s
    a new bit of comedy at the wedding dinner-the bride and groom grind wedding cake
    in each other''s faces. (shades of the three stooges!) i don''t fault the clergy
    for performing these farces in their churches. they probably hope that some of
    their errant flock will return to the fold. but, if sanctifying their marriage
    in the presence of god was what couples such as "making it legal" have in mind,
    they should confine their weddings to family members and intimate friends. i suspect
    that what they really have in mind is showing off, and garnering wedding gifts,
    such as they would have received had they done it right in the first place. these
    "after-the-fact" weddings are reminiscent of the old vaudeville days when the
    big, boffo, hilarious skit consisted of the bulging bride, her white satin gown
    straining at the seams, followed by pappy with his shotgun. it was a burlesque
    of the rites of holy matrimony. it still is. do you have the courage to print

    my husband is having a mini "fatal attraction" problem and could use your advice.
    he works at a large government complex in our hometown. this married woman who
    works in the same complex will not leave him alone. she''s had affairs with other
    men she works with, and now she''s after my husband. i have a rock-hard christian
    marriage, and my faith in my husband has never wavered, but my patience with this
    lady is wearing thin. she calls his office at least six times a day. he has left
    instructions with his secretary not to put her calls through, so now she''s started
    to call the house. i have taken to answering the phone at home, and she brazenly
    asks to talk to him. he always asks me to tell her he''s not home. i try to be
    polite, but i can take only so much. my husband swears he has never given her
    any encouragement and i believe him. how does one deal with such a persistent
    pest? having our home telephone number changed and unlisted would be a great inconvenience,
    but we may have to if there''s no other way to be free of her. fatal attraction

    when my husband and i got married, he said he didn''t want children "right away."
    i agreed. that was eight years ago, and now he says he doesn''t want any children
    at all! he''s even using a birth control method, and i am heartbroken to say the
    least. i was an elementary schoolteacher for 10 years, and i love children. i''m
    approaching my 36th birthday, and not only is my biological clock ticking away,
    but i would like to be young enough to enjoy my grandchildren. whenever i try
    to discuss it to find out why he''s so against having children, he simply says,
    "i just don''t want any kids!" he keeps repeating that sentence, but never gives
    me a reason. he''s only 42 and in excellent health, so i can''t understand why
    he''s so opposed to having children. don''t suggest counseling. i''ve already
    asked him, and he says he doesn''t need anyone to "counsel" him as he has no problem
    with his decision. any suggestions? wants motherhood'

    he quickly added extra pounds. after experiencing high blood pressure, kidney
    stones and a heart problem, his physician told him to lose weight or prepare for
    surgery. the last time i saw him, he had gone up six suit sizes. i said goodbye.
    i made my second husband model for me in his underwear before we were married.
    he was 6-2, 175 pounds, handsome and a doctor to boot. immediately after our marriage
    he started to put on weight. by our 10th anniversary he had gained 90 pounds.
    (his breasts were larger than mine, and he absolutely crushed me when we made
    love.) meanwhile, i stayed within five pounds of what i weighed when i married
    him. he was shocked when i left him. i realize that not everyone can stay slim

    a reader asked, "why don''t people who are sick stay home, instead of going to
    work and giving everybody else their cold, flu, or whatever they have that seems
    to be going around?" i can answer that in four words: they need the money. many
    jobs don''t include "sick days"-it''s no work, no pay. many days i''ve dragged
    myself to work feeling lousy, but i can''t afford the luxury of staying home.
    my last job allowed six days off a year. but nobody would dare to take them because
    it would reflect on their job performance record. if you were out sick more than
    six days, you were called in and "counseled"-and when it came time to be promoted,
    your work record was marked "not dependable." now, about keeping kids home from
    school because of sickness: in my son''s school, they actually lowered his grade
    by a whole letter because he was out more than eight days in one semester! my
    sister is a 27-year-old widow with two children, 5 and 7. she saves her days off
    without pay for their illnesses. her take-home pay is $210 a week, so two days
    off brings her paycheck down to $126. now you know why people don''t stay home
    when they''re sick. rhode island mother'

    as i was leaving the second floor of a major department store yesterday, i saw
    a little boy around 3 or 4 years old screaming hysterically as he ran blindly
    and all alone across the floor and onto the escalator right behind me. halfway
    down the escalator, he was still alone and screaming. his little face was contorted
    and purple. that was bad enough, but a woman ahead of me- all the way down at
    the bottom of the escalator-turned around and yelled, "no, i don''t want you!
    you''re a bad boy!" abby, i am a mother, too, and i can''t begin to describe how
    much i hurt for that boy. i could never dream of pretending, even for a second,
    to abandon a child. i might have given him a tongue lashing, or threatened to
    spank him, but never would i say, "i don''t want you," and i surely would never
    have taken my eyes off that kid in a large department store, never mind turning
    my back and leaving him! later i was sorry i didn''t give that woman a royal blasting.
    what would you have done? human, too, in boston'

    a while back someone wrote to you complaining because she got too much attention
    while shopping in a department store. (she said she wanted to just "look" without
    having a salesperson pounce on her and stick to her like glue.) abby, what planet
    does this person live on? the last time a salesperson "stuck to me like glue"
    was 20 years ago. if i''m lucky enough to find someone to wait on me, i stick
    to her (or him) like glue! last winter i was looking for a flannel shirt, and
    when i asked the salesperson if she had any, she looked at me like i was crazy.
    then she asked me what "flannel" was! last month, my favorite department store
    eliminated two cashiers'' counters, and there was one woman frantically trying
    to help the line of customers waiting for her. so, dear "too much attention,"

    i just sat through a sunday morning sermon in which our minister used the phrase

    of reproduction, and what happens? an ignorant, callous patriarch stands in front

    well, i''m not going to take it anymore. all life in this world is born of woman.

    several years ago, my 10-year-old daughter, our collie named ruff and i visited

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    kitty carlisle hart has spent her life in the spotlight. panelist on the former
    television show "to tell the truth" on cbs, actress, singer, raconteur and arts
    activist, kitty carlisle hart has traveled in the most celebrated circles. but
    she has suffered sorrow and loss as well, particularly the death in 1961 of her
    husband, moss hart, the pulitzer prize-winning playwright and director. in her
    new autobiography, "kitty" (doubleday, $18.95), hart writes about her joys and
    her grief, and how she rebuilt life for herself and her two children after her
    husband died. in this excerpt she describes how her participation in a television
    program grew into new and enriching work promoting the in the early ''60s i was
    the moderator and interviewer of a television show called "women on the move."
    it was dedicated to female accomplishment on every level. we had women who were
    at the top of their professions and fitted into this pattern. jacqueline cochran,
    the first woman pilot to exceed the speed of sound in a jet plane; mary roebling,
    head of the trenton trust co.; dorothy rodgers, the wife of composer richard rodgers,
    decorator and inventor (the jonny-mop and nonperishable dress patterns); dr. louisa
    bates ames, a child psychologist and cofounder of the gesell institute; abigail
    van buren ("dear abby"); babe didrikson, the great athlete; the economist sylvia
    porter; composer-lyricist sylvia fine kaye. "women on the move" didn''t have a
    long life (we lost out to "leave it to beaver"), but it created some little stir.
    right after it folded, an assistant to new york state gov. (nelson) rockefeller,
    nina jones, called me up. she had seen the show and had been impressed. she told
    me rockefeller had organized a two-day meeting on opportunities for women, and
    she asked me if i''d like to chair it. gov. rockefeller had a sharp instinct for
    ideas whose time had come, and the ability to dramatize them. i had never chaired
    anything, but i moved into this new environment as if i knew what i was doing.
    i introduced the governor and the speakers, and i visited the workshops. the conference
    created so much interest that the governor asked me to tour the state, gather
    up the ideas that had been discussed and write a report ("the kitty carlisle hart
    report of 1966"). i was pushed into doing what moss (hart, her husband) said was
    good for me: shake up your life every so often. it was a pleasure working for
    rockefeller. the whole operation resulted in the women''s unit, a small agency
    attached to the executive chamber, and i was appointed honorary chairman. it was
    my first volunteer government job. i wrote a monthly newsletter; we set up training
    courses on how to apply for jobs, for women on welfare who had never been employed,
    and halfway houses for girls coming out of prison. we also promoted a fairly new
    idea to accommodate teachers who had children; two women on the same job, with
    two shifts, mornings and afternoons. i discovered the power that women have to
    get things done when they band together. the professional women in the office,
    evelyn cunningham, june martin, virginia cairns and nina jones, guided my small
    steps into this new world with affection and amused indulgence. without being
    aware of it, i was being given a crash course in state government. i learned a
    little bureaucratese, about agencies and acronyms, one in particular. going over
    an agenda one day, there were 10 items all headed by initials. i understood them
    all until the last one. "what on earth is kch?" i asked, and they laughed. "that''s
    you!" a door was opening-all i had to do was step forward. at a fundraiser for
    the democrats, carol hausaman and elinor guggenheimer asked me if i''d like to
    think about running for state senator against roy goodman. it never occurred to
    me to question their authority to make such an offer. i just thought i''d better
    get some advice. ever my mother''s daughter ("go to the top!"), i called gov.
    rockefeller. after spending a good deal of time discouraging me from running for
    the state legislature, he made an about-face, upping the stakes, and said, "you
    should be in public life; you should run for congress." he was suggesting that
    i run against my very own congressman, ed koch, on the republican ticket! i was
    too flabbergasted to say more than "i''ll think it over." now i really needed
    advice. after bennett cerf''s death, phyllis had married robert wagner, who had
    been mayor of new york for 12 years. he was a most experienced and astute politician,
    and also one of the kindest men i had ever known. phyllis suggested that i talk
    to him. "i think you''d do a fine job," he said, "but ed koch is so strong you
    couldn''t possibly beat him. why make your first try for elective office where
    you know you can''t win?" next i went to marietta tree, by then ambassador to
    the u.n., and to clayton fritchey, adlai stevenson''s closest adviser. they agreed
    with bob, but they both said that i should ask for an appointive job. before i
    had a chance to call the governor, he called me. he caught me at the worst possible
    moment. i was in my dressing room at nbc, getting ready for "to tell the truth,"
    surrounded by makeup and wardrobe women and hairdressers. i couldn''t say i wasn''t
    there-i had picked up the phone myself. i motioned everyone to leave-it wasn''t
    the kind of call i could concentrate on with all those people fiddling with me.
    i began to improvise. "governor darling (that''s what i always called him), i
    couldn''t win against ed koch now, and by the time the party gave me an easier
    assignment and i won, i''d be too old to walk up the steps of the capitol unaided.
    anyway, i''m a democrat. what would you think about an appointive job?" out of
    this conversation came one of the most important changes of my life. three days
    later the governor called and offered me the vice chairmanship of the new york
    state council on the arts under chairman seymour knox. "now you''re talking!"
    i said. "i''d love it!" then he added, "and someday i want you to be chairman."
    the council on the arts had been founded in 1960 by rockefeller, whose interest
    in the arts was innate and passionate and who knew that the arts needed shoring
    up. moss had exactly the same idea at the same time. i just found a 1960 interview
    in the harvard crimson. he said: "the economics of the theater are prohibitive.
    the method for correcting this situation, however, does not lie in the power of
    the playwrights or the producers. the solution rests only in government subsidy."
    for five years i served with two chairmen: seymour knox, banker, collector of
    modern art and the founder of one of the best small museums in the world, the
    albright knox of buffalo. joan davidson, who followed him, had innovative ideas
    and was very creative. she left after 18 months to head the j.m. kaplan foundation.
    then gov. hugh carey offered the chairmanship to me. but though i had been on
    the council for five years, the difference between vice chairman and chairman
    is like the difference between a bicycle and a rocket ship to the moon. the chairman
    is the chief executive officer of a state agency and is accountable to the governor,
    the legislature and the constituents for the fair distribution of taxpayers''
    money. in other words, so much-and so many-would be depending on me. i had been
    helped when i was young by so many people. now i would have the chance to do the
    same for those young artists coming up behind me. but was the desire to help enough?
    i started adding up my qualifications. i knew theater and music; "to tell the
    truth" had given me nationwide recognition, no small help; and with the women''s
    unit, i had had some experience with state government. because i felt the responsibility
    was overwhelming, i galloped off again to my friends. i canvassed them all more
    than once while i agonized. the advice ranged from "don''t do it; you''ll have
    a stroke; it will kill you," to "why not?" i had been calling phyllis wagner more
    than the others, for i felt she knew more about it. late one night i called her
    once again. phyllis, finally at the end of her patience, shouted, "oh, do it!"
    that was exactly what i wanted to hear. i called the governor and accepted. i
    never forgot that nelson rockefeller had wanted me to be chairman. i telephoned
    him at once. "governor darling," i said (he was then vice president), "i have
    something to tell you." there was a tiny pause on the other end, and he said with
    real pleasure, "you''re chairman of the arts council!" a few days later i got
    a letter from him: "dear kitty: "just a note to tell you how thrilled i am with
    your appointment as chairman of the new york state council on the arts. i know
    you''ll do your usual marvelous job . . . . "again, congratulations and warm personal
    regards. "sincerely, (signed) nelson" underneath, in his own handwriting, was
    a p.s.: "i never thought-or dared hope-it would work out this way! it has restored
    everyone''s faith! very best, nelson." the council has become a very complex operation
    in the 16 years i''ve been there, although the basic structure remains constant.
    the council consists of a 20-member board appointed by the governor-all unsalaried,
    including me-and a paid staff of about 95. we fund nonprofit institutions, large
    and small, the rural, the emerging, and the avant-garde. the council''s budget
    is recommended by the governor and appropriated by the state legislature, with
    some small help from the federal government. it is all taxpayers'' money, and
    i think it''s the best money the state spends. the council''s board has always
    sustained and upheld me, and they (the board members) have given time and effort
    to the great demands made upon them. at an age when most people''s lives are narrowing
    and diminishing, mine is expanding at a cosmic rate. i don''t complain; i''m of
    the school that thinks if you stop working you go under. in 1986 i was reappointed
    by gov. (mario) cuomo for another five years as chairman of the arts council.
    i''ve received many honorary degrees, which gives me enormous pleasure because
    i never graduated from anything. the best prescription for keeping healthy and
    attractive is good genes, a good disposition and a good diet. the genes are out
    of your hands; a good disposition is up to you. my children are giving me a fine
    old age (which will be here in a few years!). i have the best possible relationship
    with them. they think i''m slightly eccentric, which allows me a lot of leeway.
    i enjoy them, and i admire them with all my heart. i have watched my son the producer
    produce his father''s plays for the stage and for television (he even offered
    me a part in one episode.), while my daughter and son-in-law have produced my
    first grandchild. the joy of seeing james hart stoeckle at the age of 2 1/2 hours
    was bittersweet. i walked home from the hospital by myself. i needed time to be
    alone with moss-i missed him so. when i sang "fledermaus" at the metropolitan
    opera, my mother was the one i wanted to share the glory with, but walking back
    from new york hospital, it was moss i wanted, and i talked to him all the way
    home. i imagined what he might have said about our first grandchild. witty or
    sentimental, he would be terribly moved; his feeling for family was so strong.
    i wept all over again with the ache of my loss. the path my mother set my feet
    on can lead heaven knows where. mother''s pronouncement in the beginning is still
    true: i wasn''t the prettiest girl you ever saw, i wasn''t the best actress and
    i certainly wasn''t the finest singer; but with a bit of courage and a dash of
    self-discipline, a small talent can go a long, long way. caption: photo: (kitty

    our daughter is 26. she''s living with a man we''ve never met. they have lived
    together for more than two years. eighteen months ago, she called to tell us that
    she was pregnant. at the time, i suggested that they get married, but she said
    she didn''t know if she really "loved" him. they now are the parents of a healthy
    10-month-old boy. last week, this daughter (who lives 1,000 miles away) called
    to say that she decided to marry this man-and would we pay for the wedding? i
    didn''t know what to say. we haven''t seen her for more than two years. two years
    ago, my wife and i drove from phoenix to denver to surprise her on her birthday.
    we called her from a service station on the outskirts of town, and were told she
    had other plans and couldn''t see us that week. almost every call we''ve had from
    her since she left home at 18 was an sos for money. my first reaction to her request
    that we pay for her wedding was anger- although i didn''t express it. i don''t
    think we should pay for it. what do you think? hot in arizona'

    a gift was made in their name in the amount of $( ), rather than sending a personal
    gift to each of them as she has done in the past. it seems the reason for this
    new plan is because she has not received thank-you notes from them in the past,

    write thank-you notes for gifts, and i am all for giving money to charities, but
    i question her decision. what will this teach her grandchildren about giving?
    what is her motive for giving gifts in the first place? whatever happened to the

    today, on nov. 11, america will honor her veterans. i would like to ask your readers
    to consider a special group of men and women who fought a war that has become
    "the forgotten war." thirty-eight years ago, on june 25, 1950, the north koreans
    crossed the 38th parallel of korea and invaded south korea. it was called a "police
    action" and the united nations responded by sending troops to korea. besides the
    south koreans, the majority of fighting men were americans. when a truce was finally
    called that ended in a stalemate on july 27, 1953, 5.5 million men and women had
    fought directly or indirectly in this "conflict." of these 5.5 million, 103,000
    were wounded, 54,263 were killed and 8,177 were classified as missing in action
    or prisoners of war. there has been much publicity about the vietnam memorial,
    but the military personnel who fought to secure the freedom of south korea have
    only the tv series "m+a+s+h" to remind people that we were there. i lost my beloved
    husband of eight months when he was shot down over north korea on his first combat
    mission. his remains have never been returned to me. who will remember those who
    gave their lives in the korean war? who will remember: 1. that when they returned,
    there were no welcoming parades-only apathy? 2. that in 1953 they had to live
    with their own silent hell of wartime memories, as "post-traumatic stress disorder"
    was unknown then? 3. that their feats were chronicled in only a few paragraphs
    in history books, and they have all but been ignored by the media? at long last,
    congress has finally approved a long-overdue memorial for the korean war vets.
    it is to be situated across from the vietnam memorial. six million dollars are
    needed. hyundai motor corp. in south korea has contributed $1.2 million in gratitude.
    abby, you have espoused many worthwhile causes in the past. i hope you will consider
    this one. our ranks are diminishing with age, and time is of the essence. if any
    of your readers would like to make a small tax-free donation, it would be gratefully
    appreciated. checks can be made out to: the korean war memorial fund, p.o. box

    several years ago you had a letter in your column from a man who wanted to go
    to medical school but hesitated because he would be "x" years old after 10 years
    of schooling. you asked him, "and how old will you be in 10 years if you don''t
    go to medical school?" abby, i have always wanted to go to law school, but my
    then-husband discouraged me, so after we were divorced, i promised myself that
    as soon as i got on my feet again, i''d go back to school. the months, then the
    years, began slipping away, and i began to think that i was too old (early 30s)
    to pursue a law career. your answer to the potential medical student was just
    what i needed to jolt me to my senses. i immediately enrolled in college part-time
    so i could continue to work. i attended classes evenings and summers. when i graduated
    (magna cum laude, phi beta kappa), i was able to quit my job and attend law school
    full time. next may i will graduate, and although i am a bit older than my classmates,
    there are several who are even older than i am. thank you, abby. you made my career!

    thank you for printing the letter from "feeling guilty"-the mother who couldn''t
    bring herself to show love to her 15-year-old daughter. i know exactly how she
    feels. for the first four or five years of my son''s life, i simply could not
    show him any affection and i was miserable because i couldn''t do anything about
    it. deep down i really loved tommy and would have killed anyone who tried to harm
    him. yet i held him at arm''s length. why? because i was crazy in love with his
    father, "mike," who ordered me to get an abortion when i told him i was pregnant.
    (we were not married.) i considered an abortion, made all the arrangements, but
    couldn''t go through with it at the last minute. that cost me my relationship
    with mike. i married someone else for all the wrong reasons, but that marriage
    didn''t last long. as time went on, i found myself being unreasonably hostile
    to tommy. it got so bad that i actually gave him to a friend for a few days so
    i could get my head screwed on straight. after hours of soul-searching and praying,
    god finally spoke to my heart. he said, "you are blaming tommy for being born
    and coming between you and mike." when i finally admitted it to myself, it was
    as though a heavy weight was lifted from my shoulders. tommy is 11 now, and i''ll
    never forget one day about three years ago, we were driving down the street, and
    i just felt like reaching over, giving his arm a pat and saying, "i love you."
    he turned toward me, his big brown eyes filled with tears, and said, "mommy, i
    don''t remember ever hearing you say that before." abby, that just about broke
    my heart. imagine being 7 years old and never hearing your mom say "i love you"
    before. from that day on, i changed my ways and have said "i love you" every day.
    and you know what? i really do. no more guilt in illinois'

    i could have written that letter signed "feeling guilty." i thought i was the
    only mother in the world who had that problem. i had a 13-year-old daughter i
    couldn''t love. to make matters worse, i had two younger children from my second
    marriage and i had no trouble loving them at all. i knew my feelings were wrong,
    unfair and downright mean, but i couldn''t change my feelings. things got so bad,
    i went to a psychiatrist because i wasn''t able to sleep nights for the guilt
    i was feeling. in less than a year, everything became perfectly clear. i didn''t
    realize it at the time, but this innocent child was the image of my first husband''s
    mother who detested me because, as was the case in "feeling guilty," her son had
    to marry me. there was more to it, of course. i was still in high school, and
    he was in college and had to drop out and go to work to support me and the baby.
    his mother always thought i ruined his chances for a college education and a successful
    professional career. anyway, i know it''s irrational for me to have blamed my
    daughter, but that is what i did. it wasn''t her fault that she was the image
    of her father''s mother. it all came out on the psychiatrist''s couch. thank god,
    i sought the help i needed. keep recommending professional help, abby. i shudder

  body: 'dear readers: tomorrow will mark the 12th annual great american smokeout,
    a one-day campaign to encourage smokers to quit smoking for 24 hours, just to
    prove they can do it. the idea, conceived by lynn r. smith, editor of the monticello
    (minn.) times, has now spread to canada, great britain, france, ireland, australia,
    south africa, norway, finland and sweden. last year, more than 19.5 million smokers
    tried to quit for the day. this represents more than 39 percent of the nation''s
    50 million smokers. breast cancer used to be the biggest killer for women. but
    the no. 1 cause of death among women and men today is lung cancer. an estimated
    92,000 men and 44,000 women will die of lung cancer in 1988. and now, a word about
    smoking-related diseases-emphysema, chronic bronchitis and heart disease: this
    year an estimated 320,000 will die from one of these. this total exceeds the number
    of u.s. battle deaths in world war ii; it is eight times as many people who die
    in automobile accidents every year! a congressional study has reported that health
    costs from the adverse effects of smoking have reached a new high of $100 billion
    a year in increased medical bills and lost productivity. the loss in death and
    disability cannot be measured. (and how does one measure the amount of heartache,
    remorse and guilt suffered as a result of a preventable, self-induced tragedy?)
    what about "secondhand" smoke? is it actually damaging to non-smokers to be in
    the presence of those who are smoking? yes! furthermore, studies reveal that the
    children of smokers are more prone to lung problems and allergies than are children
    of non-smokers. for years i have begged my young readers, "if you smoke, quit
    now. if you don''t smoke, don''t start!" yet an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 kids
    light up for the first time every day. why? peer pressure, no doubt. quitting
    "cold turkey" is the hardest way to quit, but my readers have told me it''s the
    most effective, and in the long run, the easiest way. cutting down is less traumatic,
    but the temptation to smoke is often too powerful to resist while smoking just
    one, two or three cigarettes a day. those who are heavily addicted may require
    help to break the habit. call your local chapter of the american cancer society
    for information. so if you''re hooked on cigarettes and have been telling yourself,
    "one of these days i''m going to quit," why not start tomorrow? it won''t be easy,
    but it will be the best thanksgiving present you can give yourself-and those who
    love you. p.s. a favor, please? if you quit tomorrow, even for 24 hours, i want
    to hear from you. then write again and let me know how long you were able to stay
    clean. good luck. keep me posted. p.s.s. apropos "thanks for not smoking" signs
    some folks have in their homes: i once saw a sign that read: "if you smoke on
    these premises, we will assume that you are on fire, and you will be treated accordingly."

    i am enclosing two items clipped today from the atlanta constitution. they appeared
    one directly above the other. the first reports that a mineola, n.y., driver was
    racing down the street at 100 miles per hour. his car crashed into a limousine
    carrying a wedding party. instantly killed were the groom, age 27, and his brother,
    who was the best man, age 29. the bride (age 24) died 18 days later without knowing
    of her husband''s death. the driver of the car that killed them was sentenced
    to 28 months to seven years in prison. the other item was about a man in lubbock,
    texas, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for biting off part of a police
    officer''s ear! the jury deliberated only 10 minutes before arriving at the sentence.
    am i mistaken? or is this a case of misplaced priorities? out of step in atlanta'

    i am a chinese woman who came to the united states 15 years ago. i was in my late
    20s and could not speak english very well. i read your column faithfully to learn
    the english language and more about the customs in my new country. lately i have
    read in your column that some people do not wish to be called "honey." may i relate
    my experience regarding same? when i first came here, i was especially nervous
    talking on the telephone because my english was so poor. once i had to make a
    business call, so i dialed a number. a lady answered with a very sweet voice,
    and when i told her whom i was looking for, she said, "honey, i''m afraid you
    dialed a wrong number." i said, "oh, i am very sorry." i dialed again, and the
    same lady answered the phone! i was very embarrassed, but the lady was very patient,
    and she said sweetly, "what number did you dial, honey?" i told her, and she said,
    "that is my number, but there is no such person here. i think you should check
    the number again." abby, 15 years have passed. i do not remember whom i was looking
    for, but i will never forget the first time in my entire life someone-a total
    stranger whom i had bothered twice-called me "honey" twice! this would never have
    happened in my country. so why not keep the friendly american custom? you may

    the letter signed "adopted in illinois" (and your reply) prompts me to write to
    you for the first time since i started reading your column approximately 30 years
    ago. the author of that letter could very well be my daughter. i gave up an absolutely
    gorgeous baby girl for adoption 27 years ago in the state of indiana. it was the
    most painful and unselfish thing i have ever done. if there was any way i could
    have kept her and given her a life even close to normal or good, i would have.
    i was trapped in an impossible situation and had no other choice. all these years
    i have hoped and prayed that maybe someday i would get to see her. i am married
    now with two grown sons, but i never had another daughter. i have my name on file
    in nevada with an agency that unites adoptees and biological parents-but only
    if it is mutually agreeable. if my daughter''s attitude is anything like the person
    who wrote that letter, i''ll never get to see her. (she wrote: "why should i go
    searching for my ''real'' parents? i found them the day they found me.") just
    because i gave her up does not mean i did not love her-it meant i loved her enough
    to care about the kind of life she would have. abby, how could you call that letter
    a "beautiful and generous attitude"? i disagree completely. it''s a narrow-minded,
    misunderstanding attitude. there, i''ve said it, and now it''s off my chest! heartsick

    you out in public, but be prepared to entertain him at your place. he may bring
    a bottle or the steaks occasionally, but in actual dollars and cents you will
    spend more on him than he''ll spend on you. never depend on him in times of personal
    crisis. don''t believe him when he tells you his wife is a shrew, cold, homely,
    too fat (or too thin) and hasn''t slept with him for 10 years. don''t ever expect
    his wife to divorce him-even if she catches him. she knows you are not his first
    and won''t be his last. also, she is not about to give up her social status, financial
    security and retirement income because of you. however, her discovery will probably
    terminate his affair with you, so be prepared to get some new clothes, circulate

    news reports indicate that there will be more than the usual annual publicity
    on the 25th anniversary of the assassination of the late president john f. kennedy.
    shortly after that unforgettable day, i wrote a poem about the death of president
    kennedy and submitted it for publication to the pacific telephone co. where i
    was employed. it was published in the in-house publication. (i retired from the
    telephone company 15 years ago.) this poem was never copyrighted, so anyone who
    wishes to use it may do so. abby, i have enjoyed your column for many years and
    would be honored if you chose to print it. this poem is not intended to be any
    kind of political statement. i voted for kennedy, but i also voted for eisenhower,
    nixon and reagan. on the death of president kennedy i felt the shock and rage
    and grief and gloom and utter disbelief! i heard the news; somehow it seemed that
    it was only something dreamed. the president was shot, they said, a sniper''s
    bullet through the head. he''d fallen, and a red blood stain spread on the spot
    his head was lain. there cradled by his young wife''s arm, unable now to stop
    the harm. my god, what sort of troubled brain would plot a deed of such disdain?
    we ought by law to burn in flame such seekers of ignoble fame; yes, burn and torture
    publicly to quell such thoughts of infamy! or am i giving vent to hate like that
    which brewed this tragic fate? if kennedy could speak, i''m sure, he''d want us
    only to endure his passing just as we have done; then work to make this country
    one which really gives equality to those who strive to keep it free; a nation
    that will now unite more strongly for his goals of right. this land, this world
    will better be because of john f. kennedy. fred grobee, garden grove, calif.'

    thanksgiving, so why not take a few minutes to count your blessings? how''s your
    health? you have a few minor complaints? well, thank god they''re not major. obviously,
    you''re still alive. you can probably think of at least one person who isn''t
    around this year. if you awakened this morning and were able to hear the birds
    sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast table
    on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one), praise
    the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most
    of the world is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social
    security. no medicare. in fact, one-third of the people in the world will go to
    bed hungry tonight. would you rather be in bangladesh, ethiopia or nicaragua?
    are you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, pick
    up the phone and call somebody. go out of your way to do something nice for somebody.
    it''s a sure cure for the blues. are you concerned about your country''s future?
    hooray! our system has been saved by such concern. if you don''t like your elected
    officials, you can go to work and vote them out of office. we still have the soapbox
    and the ballot box. freedom rings! you can still worship at the church of your
    choice, or not worship at all if you don''t want to. you can cast a secret ballot,
    and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head or a knock
    on your door in the middle of the night. and if you want to live under a different
    system, goodbye and good luck! you are free to go. there are no walls or fences
    to keep you here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps
    you will want to use it at your table tomorrow: o, heavenly father: we thank thee
    for food and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick.
    we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom
    and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service that thy
    gifts to us may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving, and may
    god bless you and yours. love, abby by the way, want an instant high? the surest
    cure for the post-holiday blues is to do something nice for someone. why not call
    someone who lives alone and invite him (or her) to join you for lunch or dinner?
    better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get
    home." (many older people don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out
    alone after dark.) p.s. special greetings to those of you in the military who
    wrote from remote corners of the world to tell me that you are using my thanksgiving

    to our servicemen and women who would be away from their families during the holidays.
    women and men who love to bake sent cookies, brownies and fruitcakes. the elderly
    residents of the jewish center for the aged in st. louis baked 21 dozen kosher
    cookies, under strict rabbinical supervision. (they received letters of gratitude
    from marines and sailors in okinawa who enjoyed "the sweet touch of home.") i
    received hundreds of heartwarming pictures of men and women in uniform- jubilant
    as they eagerly sorted through thousands of letters, searching for some from their
    home states. veterans of previous wars wrote to give our young servicemen and
    women a lift because they remember how rough it was to be away from home for the
    holidays. romances blossomed-and some weddings took place following long pen-pal

    maybe you (or one of your readers) can give me the answer to a question that has

    so confusing and ambiguous? for example, "if you are opposed to additional funding
    for public education, vote yes." but, "if you are in favor of additional funding
    for public education, vote no." or, "if you are opposed to drilling for oil in
    a specific locality, vote yes, but if you are in favor of drilling, vote no."

    husband helps as much as he can, but he''s at work all day. maria is physically
    abusive. babysitters quit after one day. if i try to get her to do something she
    doesn''t want to do, it turns into a wrestling match. abby, i love her. she is
    my child, but i can''t understand why god did this to me. i used to go to church,
    but i can''t take maria, and no one will stay with her. i have planned my suicide,
    and the only reason i haven''t gone through with it is because i believe in hell.
    if i ever kill myself, i will take maria with me. she has already suffered enough
    on this earth. she had cancer when she was 2 and had one kidney removed. when
    i look at her while she is sleeping, she looks so beautiful and normal. my heart
    is broken. i love her, abby, but caring for her is killing me. we live in a rural
    area, and i would like to find a boarding school in the area, but when i mention

    all in nature must balance, so for every man who takes it in the ear, another
    gives it on the chin. for every woman who whips out her tongue, her sister somewhere
    gets it in the mouth. solution: there are national drives against drugs, alcohol
    and smoking; one is needed against "anger." how about "no anger group"-we could
    call it nag. mr. sore ears'

    i am a 35-year-old single woman, and i still blush. this didn''t really get bad

    ever heard of anything so stupid? when i''m with a crowd of people and a stranger
    comes up to talk to me, i get so red i could stand on a street corner and stop
    traffic. what is wrong with me? if i have a couple of drinks, i get so relaxed,
    i can talk to anyone. i can''t understand this. when i don''t drink and a stranger
    approaches me, i get hot and sweaty and i can feel my cheeks burning, so i know
    i am beet-red. i kept hoping i would outgrow this, but it seems to be getting
    worse. is there any cure for blushing? hates the color red'

    my husband (i''ll call him john) is getting on in years, but he refuses to talk
    about funeral arrangements. he says he wants to donate all his organs to medical
    science. i think he has the idea that he will save on funeral expenses if he follows
    this procedure. but, abby, when "science" is through with him, doesn''t his family

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    of all the nuisances to plague us over the years, telemarketing is at the top
    of the list. it differs from direct mail. when you get unsolicited mail, you can
    toss it out or put it aside to read when you feel like it; you can even get your
    name removed from the mailing list. but what do you do about phone calls? forget
    unlisted numbers-now the marketers use computers that simply dial numbers, one
    after the other. telemarketing is a blatant invasion of privacy. your town can
    legislate against solicitors coming to your door-but not your phone. think of
    how many baths, naps, nights'' (or days'') sleep, family dinners, lovemaking sessions
    and funeral receptions have been interrupted. and how many sick, disabled and
    elderly people have been inconvenienced by a ringing telephone. (we won''t even
    go into how many gullible people have been bamboozled on the phone.) the public
    should also be made aware that once people buy or give on the basis of a phone
    solicitation, their names are sold to other telephone solicitors as "hot prospects."
    i urge anyone who is fed up with this home invasion to take action. when one of
    these calls comes in, ask for the name and address of the organization (commercial
    or non-profit) involved, then tell them that you will buy nothing sold on the
    phone, and will support no charity that solicits in this manner. then follow it
    up with a letter, so they will know you mean business. when enough people stop
    buying or giving, these intrusive phone calls will stop paying off and come to
    a halt. mrs. m.h., chalfant, pa.'

  body: 'dear readers: well, are the christmases getting closer together or does it
    just seem that way? it''s time to start preparing for the holidays again, so do
    yourselves a favor and do your christmas or hanukkah shopping now. here''s my
    annual-slightly revised-column on holiday shopping. if you''re wondering what
    to give aunt olivia or grandpa, who doesn''t go out much, let me tell you what
    not to give them: forget dusting powder, after-shave and cologne. (they probably
    have several unopened boxes gathering dust on their closet shelves.) grandpa doesn''t
    need another necktie, and aunt sylvia doesn''t really want any more brooches,
    necklaces, bracelets or earrings. with the price of groceries so high, older folks
    who live alone on a fixed income would be delighted to received a basket of goodies.
    include small cans of salmon, chicken, ham, tuna, fruit, instant coffee, tea bags,
    crackers, cookies and instant soup mixes. older people who live in confined quarters
    do not need more "things." don''t send music boxes, statuettes or other bric-a-brac.
    a truly thoughtful gift: postcards and some lined stationery with envelopes and
    a generous supply of postage stamps. (enclose some felt-tip pens, too.) a handy
    gift: an assortment of greeting cards for all occasions, so that they, too, can
    send birthday, anniversary, graduation, get-well and condolence cards to others.
    don''t give a gift of clothing unless you''re absolutely sure the size is right.
    if you''re tempted to pass along a scarf, purse, wallet or some little doodad
    you received three christmases ago, please don''t; the recipient will probably
    find it just as useless as you did. (besides, you might get it back the year after
    next.) if someone on your gift list is living on a pension, a check for any amount
    would be far more appreciated than some useless little trinket. another thoughtful
    gift would be a year''s subscription to a newspaper or magazine you are sure he
    or she will enjoy. if you buy a gift on sale, be sure it''s appropriate, since
    if the recipient tries to exchange it, he will be told, "sorry, sale merchandise
    is not returnable." never give a pet to anyone unless you''re absolutely sure
    a pet is wanted and will be properly cared for. and if you want to delight someone
    who considers his pet a "member of the family," include a tin or two of cat or
    dog food for the pet. don''t give wine or liquor unless you''re sure the recipients
    imbibe. candy, nuts and fruitcake make wonderful gifts for those who aren''t counting
    calories, but please have compassion for those who are, and lead them not into
    temptation. also remember that many older people have difficulty chewing hard
    candies and nuts. instead of giving someone a gift with permission to "take it
    back and exchange it if it''s not what you want," save yourself (and them) time
    and effort by giving gift certificates in the first place. (p.s. a cash gift is
    always appreciated.) for those who maintain their own homes and apartments, consider
    a gift certificate for other types of service needed-window washing and rug cleaning.
    and don''t forget certificates for the barber shop, beauty parlor, taxi rides
    or dinner out. and (don''t laugh) a trip to the podiatrist! holiday time can be
    depressing for people who are alone, so if you know someone who might be alone
    and lonely, give him (or her) the best gift of all- an invitation to have a holiday
    meal with you and your family. loneliness is the ultimate poverty. love, abby

    are there any small towns or rural areas out there that want or need a good family

    of hours of volunteer services to my church and community. i have become a much
    better christian because of this unfortunate experience. sadly, state medical
    boards are very unforgiving, and if a physician loses his license in one state,
    he cannot get it back in another. (i have tried in eight different states.) i
    am 39 years old, and all i want is a chance to start over again, doing what i
    do best-practicing good, compassionate medicine in a small town somewhere. if
    a community will go to bat for me and help me regain my license, they will get,
    in return, a competent, dedicated family doctor-for life. i am signing my name
    and address, but you may prefer to sign this... hopeful in louisiana'

    i''m writing in response to your answer to "anti-fat." abby, fat is a killer!
    behind it lie medical problems that the mind simply cannot comprehend. i speak
    from experience. i had a happy marriage to a wonderful man. we had love, laughter
    and four beautiful children. never was a word said about the extra inches that
    crept onto his waist. never was a word said as i altered his clothes, or bought
    the next size bigger because the old ones simply could no longer be buttoned.
    when i met him in 1977, he was 20 years old, gorgeous and weighed 160 pounds.
    it was love at first words. we took our time and were married in 1981. on march
    25, 1988, i came home from the grocery store and found my husband leaning over
    the kitchen sink trying to breathe. his arms, shoulders and feet were numb. his
    skin was an awful shade of yellow. he refused to go to the hospital and would
    not permit me to call an ambulance. i begged and pleaded, so he finally let me
    drive him to the hospital, which was 13 miles from our home. i drove the first
    10 miles sanely, but three miles from the hospital he turned to me and said, "i
    love you, babe. forever. take care." then his body stiffened, he started to turn
    purple and make choking sounds. then he fell toward me and his body relaxed. my
    foot hit the floorboard of the car and i drove like a madwoman, knowing that help
    was near, and the faster i got him there, the better his chances were. i took
    the off ramp of the freeway at 90 miles an hour and drove into the emergency room
    entrance at burlington medical center screaming for help. the doctors and nurses
    were beautiful-they worked valiantly for what seemed like hours. i stood back,
    watching and praying the same words over and over, "please, lord, if it be your
    will-he''s only 31." the heart monitor showed only the compressions for cpr and
    jolts of electricity from the shock paddles. nothing could save him. i stood there
    and prayed as i became a widow at the age of 29. how do you explain to four young
    children that the daddy they loved would never again roll on the floor with them
    and play tickle, or read them their storybooks? how can you look at a 3-year-old
    girl and tell her that her daddy loves her but cannot hug and kiss her again because
    he is an angel now? or his 5-year-old son, c.j., that he will not be able to teach
    him how to catch a baseball or shoot baskets? these are now all my jobs. the children
    and i have memories of a beautiful, but short life of a caring man. i now have
    a pillow that will never again cradle the head of the man i loved. why? because
    he ate too much. i never saw him on the scale, but i''m sure he weighed more than
    250 pounds when he died. he was 5 feet 7 inches tall. on his certificate of death
    it reads: cause of death: arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease caused by overweight.

    "hugh" and i have been living together for eight years. he left his wife, "nettie,"
    10 years ago. (i had nothing to do with their breakup.) my problem is that they
    are in constant touch with each other. there are no children involved. nettie
    could call him here any time, but she prefers to call him at work and make arrangements
    to see him, which makes me suspicious. (this is a small town, and people see them
    together.) she sends him cutesy "miss you" cards and little gifts that he hides
    from me, and when i come across them, he "can''t remember" where he got them!
    hugh gave me an engagement ring five years ago, but he won''t set a wedding date.
    i don''t want a big, splashy wedding. i just want a wedding ring. he says he loves
    me, but if he does, what does he need with nettie? when i divorced my husband,
    we made a clean break, and i have no desire to keep in touch with him. why can''t
    hugh do the same with his ex? this is a constant source of irritation. worse yet,
    he refuses to talk about it. what do you make of this? in doubt'

    i need your help. i have a loving, wonderful wife and a small child. life is treating

    suicide have pervaded my mind since i was a teen. i thought that i had resolved
    my problems through my strong faith, but recently, to my despair and shame, sexual
    urges toward my own daughter have brought the self-loathing back. i telephoned
    a counselor and explained my predicament without disclosing my identity. i confessed
    that while giving my daughter a bath, i had become physically aroused, but, of
    course, i did not act on my feelings. this counselor told me that if i identified
    myself, he would then be put in a position of having to call the welfare department
    and have my daughter removed from our home! i am horrified! thus far, nobody in
    the family has been harmed. the child had no idea that i was aroused, but removing
    her from the family while i am attempting to resolve this problem would only throw
    the family into turmoil. our family life would be ruined, and the child would
    be the victim. please help me. where can i go to work on this problem without

    with christmas just around the corner, i''ll bet many of your other readers are
    struggling with this issue. for years, my in-laws sent us checks for christmas
    instead of "tangible" gifts, and now my parents are starting to do the same. i
    thought of sending each of them a check, too, but my husband refuses to go along
    with it, saying it is too cold and impersonal. i heartily agree. but why should
    i run around shopping for personal gifts for each of them, then go through the
    trouble of gift wrapping and mailing them on time (we all live in different states),
    only to receive a check or two in return? none of them are incapacitated or very
    old, and they have as much time as we have. neither my husband nor i are difficult
    to buy for; we have always enthusiastically thanked them for gifts in the past.
    so, i thought i''d send them a list of practical gift ideas (titles of books,
    sizes and colors of desirable items of clothing) that they could shop from. if,
    upon receiving the lists, they still choose to send money, can i tell them in
    the future they should contribute the money to a charity in our name? i''d rather
    do that than get more checks. it really bugs me to get money from close relatives

    together and pay our own way. every time i mention marriage, he says he doesn''t
    know what he wants. i thought maybe after my five children were grown he''d start

    mother remarried and moved to another state. my husband and i have raised three
    children who are now married and living on their own, so we have two extra bedrooms.
    michele graduated from high school last year, and her mother called and asked
    if michele could move in with my husband and me while she attends a college near
    us. we felt this would be ok, as michele is 18 and considered an adult. michele''s
    parents agreed to pay us $125 a month rent, and said that all her other expenses
    would be taken care of by them. so far, we have been paid only one month''s rent,
    and michele has been here for seven months. we paid a $300 repair bill for her
    car; our phone bills are outrageous from the calls she makes home and to her friends.
    she is always borrowing extra money, which she says her mother will repay, but
    we haven''t seen one dime of it. michele''s room is always a terrible mess, and

    as a new mother, may i blow off a little steam about a few things that bother

    little hands or face. this is very annoying because one never knows where a stranger''s
    hands have been, and i am terrified that my baby will be contaminated. also, when
    my son whimpers or cries in public, i wish strangers would not offer advice, such
    as, "maybe he''s hungry-don''t you think you should feed him?" or, "maybe he''s
    wet; maybe you should change him." and i hate it when a stranger says, "don''t
    you think your baby is overdressed (or underdressed) for this weather?" abby,
    i''ve been reading you for years, and i realize that i probably have been guilty
    of doing the above myself, so if you print this, perhaps other well-meaning strangers

    this may sound like a trivial complaint, but it has become a major problem with
    me. first of all, i''m seven months pregnant; i''m already big as a house, my
    ankles are swollen and it''s hard for me to get comfortable in bed at night, so
    sometimes i-or my husband- will go to sleep on the couch in the living room. well,
    "marty," my husband''s brother, is being divorced, so he comes over here (uninvited)
    several times a week, and he''s started to stay overnight. we have no guest room
    in this cramped apartment, so marty sleeps on the couch. my husband feels sorry
    for him and doesn''t want to tell him not to come over so much, and i don''t want
    to be the one to tell him either. this has caused some arguments between my husband
    and me. i feel sorry for marty, but he''s either very stupid or totally insensitive
    not to know that he''s imposing on us. he''s not sponging off us-he has a place
    of his own-but he likes our company. how do we tell him? had it in kentucky'

    to be free, gifted and 43-is it really as bad as they say? the other night at
    a party, i met a man whom i have always thought of as a legend. he was one of
    those computer geniuses who was part of the home brew computer club, which also
    included the likes of stephen wozniak and steve jobs. it was this group that met
    in the ''70s and invented the personal computer. the question in my mind as i
    spoke to him was: why was steve jobs on the cover of newsweek and business week
    and not him? why had stephen wozniak-and not the gentleman at the party-donated
    his spare millions from apple computer to a cockamamie rock festival? a brief
    discussion of the party boy''s background yielded a clue. "my father was jewish
    and my mother an upper-crust wasp," he said. then he added matter-of-factly, "of
    course, they were both communists." okay, he''s so smart, and that''s why he''s
    not rich. but he was also a tall, dark and zany man, so i was even more surprised
    when he said, "at the age of 43, i''ve had a kind of breakdown and decided i should
    get married." he told me he had just placed a personals ad in the paper seeking
    a wife. he claimed he had a hard time meeting women. "that''s my problem," he
    said. so i shoved him toward the crowd and said, "mingle! mingle!" as the old
    saying goes: "what profit a man if he masters a machine, but still can''t mingle
    with a woman?" i guess it really is a lovelorn mine field out there. why should
    it be so much harder to handle a woman than a piece of communications software?
    and if 3,000 how-to authors haven''t had the final word, if dear abby hasn''t
    said it all, dear alice will have a go at it: user''s manual for love-finder.
    - talk to everyone. don''t worry about what you say. wing it. free- associate
    in public. press your own "search" button. - be nice. wimpiness turns women off.
    niceness drives them wild. there''s a difference between being wimpy and being
    nice. i don''t know what it is. as mac users say: "find the pointer by clicking
    the mouse." - be yourself. if your self is a jerk, be prepared to love the jerk
    you attract. she is the yin madonna to your yang sean penn. you don''t really
    have an "options" button in life. - get a puppy instead of an external drive.
    it will take the edge off your desperation, put things into perspective. and if
    you already have someone to lick your feet, you won''t expect it from a woman.'

    the california bar examinations. abby, he has taken the bar exams twice a year
    since 1966! he has done okay several times, but not quite good enough to pass.
    he is ready to give up, but i keep telling he should keep trying. he has a son
    who is a lawyer. in fact, he works in his son''s law firm as a "clerk." he doesn''t
    complain, and he doesn''t feel humiliated. now i''m feeling guilty because i keep
    encouraging him. am i wrong to do this? please don''t use my name. sign this.

    just to give you an example of how much attention some doctors pay to their patients,

    he''s brought all my children into the world, has given me a complete physical
    examination every year since 1965, he''s looked into my mouth and down my throat
    during every examination, and he never noticed that i had dentures! i had a sore
    spot in my mouth, so i stopped by his office and asked if maybe my dentures needed
    adjusting, and he said, "oh, i didn''t know you wore dentures; how long have you

    i''ve been a widow for two years and thought i was getting my life back together,

    but he never actually told me he loved me until we moved in together two months
    ago. he''s not big on expressing himself, and i understand this. the problem is,
    i''m very affectionate, but he holds back-the only time he wants me to touch him
    is sexually. (we do have a very active sex life.)also, he spends a lot of time
    with his male friends, even when we go out for an evening together. i''m used
    to a lot of attention and love, so i''m really torn. i do love this guy, but i
    need to feel it coming from him, too. when i mention that i think we need more
    time alone, he turns on me and says i''m too "possessive." do you think i need
    to stop this arrangement and see other men? that really upset him in the past.
    by the way, we are both in our early 40s and he is divorced. needs more love'

    i am kathleen cronon wyosnick, and i wrote to you seeking support for the korean
    war veterans memorial. you printed my letter, and the day it appeared my phone
    started ringing at 7 a.m. and continued to ring non-stop throughout the weekend.
    i heard from other wives who had lost their husbands in korea; mothers who had
    lost sons; and men and women whose brothers, uncles and cousins were killed, wounded
    or missing in action in the korean "conflict." (although 54,246 died, 103,284
    were wounded and 8,177 were missing in action, our government never called that
    three-year battle in korea a "war.") i had calls from many korean war vets. "bob"
    phoned from montana, and in a booming voice said, "kathleen, i just want to say,
    `lady, i love you!''" before i could ask him his last name, he''d hung up. a few
    just wanted to share some war stories that had been locked away for 35 years.
    some choked up-unable to talk-and asked me to thank abby for devoting her entire
    column to the korean war vets on veterans day. abby, the mail was unbelievable!
    sacks of mail were held at the post office until we could get enough hands to
    open it. an sos went out to all the kiwanis clubs in the area. they recruited
    volunteers, who did an incredible job of opening it. some of the letters accompanying
    the contributions were heartwarming: john lopez, a sunnyvale, calif., marine vet
    who had been a pow, was one of the first to respond. a teen-age girl from denver
    sent $2, saying she''d never heard of the korean conflict! from san antonio came
    a check from jeane westerman, a 76-year-old retired army nurse (world war ii),
    with a note: "wish i could send more but my retirement isn''t all that great."
    al johnson, a korean war vet from vancouver, wash., sent a check saying he was
    going through a painful divorce, feeling alone and depressed, and this effort
    would give him something to do. a week later he wrote again to say he''d collected
    $5,000! another vet said he was broke, but enclosed $5 in food stamps. a check
    came from gene baenen of lake forest, ill., in honor of his kid brother-one of
    the first marines to be killed in korea. (he went over in august, was killed in
    september, and would have been 21 on christmas of that year.) abby, how can i
    thank you for all you''ve done for the veterans of the forgotten war? i want to
    shower you with roses, hugs and kisses. may god bless you in a very special way.

    i would like to respond to the church organist in cincinnati who said, "applauding
    in a house of worship is disrespectful and unacceptable behavior." i would question
    a society that applauds vigorously for a hard tackle in a football game, but thinks
    it''s inappropriate to applaud a minister''s sermon, a choir''s inspirational
    hymn or a couple''s first kiss after a marriage ceremony. i am sure i am not the
    only person who has had the desire to clap or cheer after a touching moment in

    the floods clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together before the lord."

    high school football season recently ended, and i would like your opinion of a
    practice that has been going on for a number of years in our small new jersey
    community. the parents of the members of the football team provide "victory parties"
    for the team and cheerleaders. beer and other alcoholic beverages are served.
    the host parents collect all the car keys as the teen-age guests arrive. the keys
    are returned only after the party-goers can prove that they are sober and capable
    of driving-otherwise, they must spend the night, or wait until they are sober.
    the rationale: these kind of parent-supervised parties keep the drinking teen-agers
    off the streets and save lives. they say that if such parties were not provided
    in a "safe" environment, the kids would "party" somewhere else and possibly become
    a traffic fatality statistic. in our state, the legal drinking age is 21. what
    is your opinion, abby? concerned new jersey parent'

    "not there yet" wrote of his resentment at being asked if he was entitled to a
    senior citizen''s discount since he is only middle-aged. i resent those discounts
    for another reason: in case you are not aware of it, senior citizens are the richest
    group in our population, and it appears that they are going to stay that way.
    why should a senior citizen get a 10 percent discount on drugs, forcing the less
    well-off single mother of an ill child to pay 110 percent of the cost of the drugs
    she needs? if stores gave 10 percent discounts to blonds or red-haired people,
    this practice would be seen for what it is, and a quick halt would be brought
    to its use. the worst example can be seen at our national parks where seniors

    i am a senior citizen, and the letter in your column signed "not there yet" made
    me absolutely furious! he or she wrote: "i, and many of my friends, have had days
    spoiled by that obnoxious question: `are you a senior citizen?'' (gag me with
    a cane!)" the obvious hostility against senior citizens in that letter was very
    upsetting. i infer from the writer''s comments that he or she feels that senior
    citizens are obnoxious or something on the level of a criminal. my, how times
    and values have changed. when i was a child, older people were held in high esteem.
    according to "not there yet," aging is something to be ashamed of. "not there"
    suggests that the best way to end the "prying practice" of asking if a person
    is a senior is to refuse to patronize establishments where they routinely ask
    such disgusting questions, and be sure to let the management know why. how insulting!

    i must comment on the letter concerning two crimes and your evaluation of the
    punishments for each. in the first example, a speeding driver had killed three
    people. had the driver used a gun or knife to commit these murders, he would undoubtedly
    be on death row at this time. juries should realize that an automobile can be
    a lethal weapon, and they should treat these crimes accordingly. i agree with
    you-the sentence of 28 months to seven years is indeed outrageously lenient. the
    second example concerned a police officer in lubbock, tex., who had a portion
    of his ear bitten off. in fact, a third of his ear was bitten off, chewed and
    swallowed by his attacker! the prisoner, who was on probation at the time of his
    arrest, also attempted to bite another officer and was successful in biting through
    a cb antenna cable. he also kicked at the police car repeatedly with such force
    that it became inoperable. not only did the jury find the defendant guilty, they
    sentenced him to 10 years in prison-the maximum allowed for assault on a police
    officer in the state of texas. i was an observer at that trial but did not have
    an opportunity to thank the jury for their decision. you see, the officer who
    had a third of his ear bitten off was my son. in view of all the facts, do you
    still believe the sentence was excessively harsh? maxine mcneill'

    that a policeman is the enemy. i''ve been a law enforcement officer for eight
    years and have seen how children fear police officers, and it disturbs me. last
    week, while in uniform at a local hospital, i overheard a father scolding his
    5-year-old son who was crying. then the father took the boy by the hand and led
    him over to me, saying, "you see this policeman? well, if you don''t stop crying,
    he is going to put you in jail-that''s what they do to little boys who cry!" well,

    him in front of his son for having made me the bad guy. abby, don''t these parents
    realize that it''s wrong to put the fear of police officers in the minds of young
    children? there are many cases on file of lost children who hid from the police
    while being sought because they were more afraid of the police than being lost!

    two boys enrolled at her school. since many of these teenage moms will continue
    to live at home, the principal of "kelly''s" school asked me to write something
    for their newspaper from a grandmother''s point of view. i thought you might like
    to share the enclosed message with people in the rest of the nation, some of whom
    may be facing similar circumstances. a grandmother at 33 an open letter to my

    some of the drastic changes about to take place in your lifestyle. since you have
    chosen to remain at home, it is important that you have a clear understanding
    of what will be expected of you after the birth of your child. you will be playing
    a dual role, and it may be difficult for you. on one hand, you will be my child,
    my responsibility. you will be expected to honor the same rules and regulations
    as your brothers and sisters. this includes doing your chores, cleaning your room,
    honoring your curfew and being respectful to your parents. if you are disobedient
    or uncooperative, you will be disciplined in the usual manner. on the other hand,
    however, you will be a mother, and your child will be your responsibility alone.
    when he needs tending to, tend to him. this means that if you are gossiping on
    the phone with a friend and the baby begins to cry, you will have to hang up and
    take care of his needs. you cannot ignore his wails (it would be too nervewracking
    for the other family members), and you cannot pass the task to one of us (it''s
    not our responsibility). "get the baby, mom-i''m on the phone" will not be tolerated.
    also, don''t expect a built-in baby sitter on a moment''s notice. in exchange,
    i promise to try not to interfere with your child-rearing decisions unless you
    are endangering the baby by neglect or abuse. if i slip and give some unsolicited
    advice, simply lift an eyebrow and give me "the look," and i will shut up. now,
    don''t panic. it''s not that i won''t help at all. naturally, i will be thrilled
    with my new grandchild and will gladly spend countless hours with him (or her),
    but only when it''s convenient for me or arranged or an emergency. also, i will
    answer any questions you may have or show you how to do something when you ask
    for my assistance. and i won''t mind baby-sitting if you ask ahead of time and
    i have made no plans. in other words, i will be there to help you, but from a
    distance. you are just one step away from adulthood, and now it is my job as your
    mother to step back and let you test your wings. i love you, and i''m looking
    forward to watching you raise your child. i''ll bet you will be a terrific mom!

    "no town" thought her daughter-in-law was being inexcusably rude. your comment:
    "your daughter-in-law may not be rude at all; she could be very shy and insecure.
    instead of judging her, try reaching out to include her so that she will feel
    more comfortable," etc. abby, although the daughter-in-law may in fact be shy
    and insecure, she should have the common sense and good manners to leave her reading
    material at home. if she''s so shy and insecure that she can''t face her in-laws

    kind of son would allow his wife to treat his parents so shabbily? ignoring her

    i am beside myself with guilt. on the last night of my visit to a childhood friend
    who now lives in another city, her live-in boyfriend woke me in the middle of
    the night, and i let him make love to me. as far as i can tell, my friend had
    no idea (he left her sleeping in their room). i don''t know why i didn''t stop
    him-especially since we used no protection and i could have even gotten pregnant!
    maybe i was lonely or resented her having someone since i''ve been unlucky in
    love. the next evening, when we were alone for a minute or two, i told him i felt
    guilty over what had happened. he seemed to feel the same, and told me that he
    liked me and he enjoyed it, but we should not repeat it. i tried to act normal
    with my friend, but felt miserable inside. i''ve betrayed her trust and don''t
    deserve her friendship. also, i am aware that the man she loves and hopes to marry
    would cheat on her in such a low way-with her friend, in her house! should i tell
    her? what if he tells her later? what if they decide to marry-shouldn''t she know

    tone to the ceremony by having knicky, our female labrador, serve as the ring

    the handle of the basket with her teeth and come down the aisle on cue. all went
    well at the rehearsal, but at the wedding knicky got excited when she saw us at
    the altar and she ran down the aisle, leaving the basket behind. you can imagine
    the laughter! but this in no way detracted from the seriousness of our commitment.

    everyone at camp knew it and, naturally, it got back to me, which hurt me deeply.
    after the camp closed, rolf went back to canada and janet came home. she called
    me, of course, asking if we could get together. i was hesitant. while i still
    cared for her, i didn''t trust her and i told her so. after much discussion, i
    agreed to see her again. we had a long talk. janet said she still loved me, but
    when two people are in love they should ask for nothing in return. she admitted
    to being intimate with rolf, but insisted it had nothing to do with her feelings

    i''m sure i''m not the only woman with this problem, so maybe you can help many
    others if you answer this in the paper. my husband never gives me a compliment.
    when i ask, "how was dinner?" he says, "i ate it, didn''t i?" if i ask, "how was
    our lovemaking?" he says, "i come back for more, don''t i?" if i ask, "how do
    i look (new dress)?" he says, "if i tell you that you look nice, you''ll expect
    it often." abby, how i long for just one small compliment once in a while-a kind
    word, a show of affection from this man. perhaps someday, somewhere, some other
    man will discover how hungry i am for a little reassurance, and he will fill that
    need. then, my husband will come home from work and i will be gone, and he will
    never know why. needy'

    as a surgeon who has performed thousands of vasectomies, i routinely ask the patient''s
    wife to sign a consent form. i feel that this is not an unreasonable request since
    i am performing a procedure that involves the family. one case comes to mind,
    which is my reason for writing to you. i normally have a 10- to 15-minute consultation
    with my patient and his spouse to explain the procedure, answer any questions
    and have them sign the consent form. in this case, the couple came to my office
    for the consultation, signed the consent form and the patient was scheduled for
    surgery. because i was busy with an emergency, i asked my secretary to telephone
    the patient''s home early in the morning and inform him not to come to the hospital
    for the scheduled surgery because i would not be able to see him. my secretary
    was quite surprised when my patient''s wife said she did not know anything about
    any "vasectomy" her husband had scheduled. she also stated that she had never
    been in my office with him to sign any "consent forms"! the wife suggested that
    our office call her husband at his place of employment to cancel his operation
    and have him call her at home immediately. needless to say, the patient was never
    seen for his scheduled vasectomy, and we never heard from him again. michael a.

    i''m sure my problem isn''t too uncommon, but even at my age (i''m a senior citizen),
    it has me somewhat baffled. i was asked out to lunch by a gentleman who made it
    rather clear that we should order the "special" of the house. (it was not an inexpensive
    restaurant, by the way.) abby, i''m not used to having to order the cheapest thing
    on the menu, and i resent it. i believe that when a gentleman asks a lady out,
    he should be prepared to allow her to order whatever she pleases. am i wrong?
    well, he has asked me out again. i really like going to nice restaurants, and
    this man can well afford it. he seems to want to spend some time with me (he calls
    me every day), but how can i let him know i enjoy the finer things of life without
    seeming greedy or grabby? at my age, i really don''t need someone who is always
    looking for the cheapest way to go. i''d rather pay my own way, but it''s nice
    to have a male companion. we get along very well, by the way. what do you suggest?

    in case you haven''t already been raked over the coals for telling the fellow

    abby, no one should practice law who has had to take the bar exam 44 times-assuming

    will pass the bar exam simply due to learning how to take it. if such a person

    met it had been over between the two of them for some time, and i believed him.)
    well, when he came back, he informed me that instead of telling his ex-girlfriend
    that he was engaged to marry me, he ended up in bed with her and now he wanted
    to end our relationship! i was in shock. we had already taken the diamond ring
    and wedding band to the jeweler to be sized. after he gave me the ax, he picked

    i must respond to your column on forgiveness: forgiveness is a gift to the giver.
    i speak from personal experience. years ago, i took legal action against my ex-husband
    for payment of back child support. i had a good job with an adequate salary, but
    i could have used some financial help, as i was raising our two sons alone. "rob"
    had a drinking problem, which was one of the reasons we parted, but i was determined
    to get what he owed me-regardless. then suddenly, i asked myself: what am i doing?
    our sons had always had a very good relationship with their father, and my taking
    rob to court would only alienate him from his family. i made up my mind that i
    would forgive rob and forget the money he owed me, so i called my attorney and
    told him to withdraw the legal action-that i was letting rob off the hook. as
    it turned out, that was the wisest decision i ever made. seven years later rob
    was dead of a massive heart attack. he was 48. during the final seven years of
    his life, our relationship was very cordial, and he was able to establish good
    communication with his sons. i am glad i let rob off the hook. if i had taken
    him to court, i always would have felt guilty, wondering if i had caused him stress

    i want to thank you for your quiz about homosexuality in which you debunked many
    myths. i am sure you educated many people, but, abby, you write about gays as
    though they were another species, as if the reader had never known any, as if
    there were none among your readers. the fact is, we are your readers. we are also
    your sons and daughters, your grandchildren, your brothers, sisters, cousins,
    aunts, uncles, mothers and fathers. we are your neighbors, your teachers, your
    supermarket checkers, your stockbrokers, your plumbers, your mail carriers, your
    nurses, your doctors or your lawyers. in short, we are people you know, and often
    people you love. because people often confuse effeminacy in men and masculinity
    in women with homosexuality, most are not aware how many gays they come in contact
    with every day. if they knew, and stopped thinking about us as strangers or strange
    creatures, it would go a long way toward helping solve many of the problems gay
    men and women face in our society. gay in alabama ---------- "how to be popular"

    may i reply to "m.s. sejpal, d.d.s.," whose letter you published accompanied by
    an article titled "the dumbest person in the world." i am sick of hearing that
    i should go somewhere else if i don''t like it here. this is my country, too,
    and i love it just as much as you do. possibly more, because i''m not afraid to
    criticize it when it is wrong. it takes courage to face the truth and try to correct
    things. nothing was ever accomplished by waving the flag and saying, "we''re better
    than the trash next door, so shut up!" being better than the worst is nothing
    to be proud of. to take issue with a few things we americans have to be "proud"
    of: -almost unlimited natural resources: not anymore-thanks to the unbridled greed
    of industry. -a ballot box nobody can stuff: really? ask nixon about 1960 in chicago.
    -a judicial system that is the envy of the rest of the world: our judicial system
    is not the envy of the world. plea bargaining, which allows sleazy criminals to
    get off with a slap on the wrist, is unique here. so is getting off on a technicality.
    in england, if the arresting officer errs, he is reprimanded and suspended, but
    his mistake does not allow the accused to go free. sentencing disparities are
    a disgrace-six years for beating a baby to death, but 10 years for striking a
    police officer. we have country club accommodations for political prisoners, and
    capricious parole for perpetrators of some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.
    what country would envy that? -food so plentiful that overeating is a major problem?
    tell that to the below-poverty-level citizenry. -one hundred million jobs, when
    too many of them are engaged in an overabundance of offensive weapons production,
    is nothing to brag about. we have lost our prestige in the world because too many
    wrongs have been allowed to flourish for too long, and it''s our own fault. pollyanna
    never solved any problems. she just smiled and said, "isn''t everything wonderful?"

    attend and explain to the players that there is no danger of having an oxygen
    tank explode. (oxygen does not "explode"; it only hastens burning.) well, yesterday
    someone at a bridge game expressed some fear that my wife''s oxygen tank endangered

    "feeling rotten" has no right to cleanse her conscience in the tears of her best
    friend. my advice: don''t compound the mess by confessing. you will only make
    your friend feel angry, bitter and depressed, which will give you even more to
    feel guilty about. there''s a good chance that she knows him for what he is but
    loves him anyway. if you tell her what happened, she might think you came on to
    him, or he might even tell her that you did in order to protect himself. you''ve

    in 1986 my son was married in the local methodist church. we were not members,
    so we paid $350 for the use of the church. my brother-in-law is a minister, so
    he officiated. however, my son was required to give the regular minister a gratuity
    of $75, even though he had no part in the ceremony. it is now 1989, and our daughter
    is getting married in the same church. the price for using the church is now $380.
    her uncle will again perform the ceremony. she was told that she must place a
    crisp $100 bill in a white envelope as a gratuity for the regular minister who
    will not participate in the ceremony. is this normal practice? must newlyweds
    pay twice for ceremonies if they choose to have a friend or relative from another
    church officiate? the price continues to climb, and we have one more child yet
    to be married. paying two ministers seems unreasonable to me. please don''t use

    i would like to tell "grandmother at 33," whose 16-year-old daughter is about
    to become a mother, that her advice is too little, too late. she said: "you are
    about to become a mother at 16. isn''t that nice? don''t expect me to be at your
    beck and call. i''ll baby-sit only when it''s convenient." these are "words of
    wisdom" from a mother? where was she when her daughter needed advice on how not
    to get pregnant? i don''t mean just contraception, but how to say "no" in the
    first place! if this is her oldest child, she too was pregnant at 16, so i guess
    you can''t teach what you don''t know. i am particularly angry because i am 38
    and childless. my husband and i have been trying to have a baby for eight years
    without success. we have a beautiful home with a spare room that we have been
    hoping and praying to fill one day with a crib and toys. ours is a good strong
    marriage based on love, respect and sharing. we are emotionally, intellectually
    and financially equipped to handle the responsibility of parenthood. we didn''t
    postpone having a baby because our careers came first. neither my husband nor
    i has a high-pressure job, nor do we want them. my husband is a schoolteacher
    who loves children. and my fondest dream was to be called "mommy." but we didn''t
    meet and fall in love until we were in our 30s. we have a sad situation in this
    country where children are having children, and couples like us who would give
    anything to adopt a child are told by the adoption agencies that we are "too old."

    my chest. jane in long island'

    you recently ran a series of scathing letters condemning telemarketing. it was
    discussed at length on one of our local radio call-in talk shows, and telemarketers
    took a verbal beating that made telemarketing in this area very difficult. i have
    been in sales all my life, and for years i listened to people gripe about our
    door-to-door salespeople: "they are too persistent." "they always come at the
    wrong time." then when we tried mail-outs, people complained about all the junk
    mail they were getting. we tried radio and television advertising, but people
    griped that we were aired too often and came across like used-car salespeople
    (my apology to used-car salespeople; however, that stigma persists). even newspaper
    advertisements drew fire. so, we turned to calling people on the telephone in
    order to sell our product, and never has there been a more economical way to reach
    people in the history of america-and what happens? people complain, and you add
    fuel to the flame! who in all of god''s creation ever said that we would go through
    life without interruptions? what makes people think that they possess an unalienable
    right never to be approached by anyone at any time for any reason that they feel
    to be an improper interruption? so, abby, please remember: peeking in your window
    while you are taking a shower is a direct violation of your privacy; telemarketing

    option do we have besides carrying cash for all our purchases? we do not want

    i recently started dating a physician who has genital herpes and belongs to a
    herpes support group. i have oral herpes (cold sores). he has told me that when
    he does not have any lesions, he is not contagious and he refuses to use a condom
    at these times. my girlfriend says that this is not true-that genital herpes is
    less transmittable when there are no visible lesions, but it is transmittable
    at all times, and he should use a condom during every sexual encounter. i want
    to believe the doctor, but what my girlfriend told me is confusing. should he
    wear a condom at all times? who is correct? are there any good books on the subject?

    i would like to address my remarks to "wish i''d been adopted." i am truly sorry
    you suffered as a child, but please don''t use your experience to dictate your
    conscience to me. i am an adult adoptee who has just begun to search for my birth
    parents. please let me tell you something about grown adoptees. when we were born,
    "illegitimacy" was considered such an unspeakable social horror that single pregnant
    women were pressured by parents, adoption agencies, schools and employers to give
    up their children. unwed mothers were expelled from college or high school until
    well into the ''60s, and were often refused jobs. the majority of such women did
    not simply "decide" to surrender their children for adoption. they had no other
    options. well, ms. "wish i''d been adopted," you suggest that i leave well enough
    alone, and call my adoptive parents my "real" parents. "real"? do you mean that
    my birth parents are "unreal," "imaginary" or "fake"? i have four "real" parents-two
    who created me, and two who raised me. i am now searching for my birth parents
    to show them what a wonderful job my adoptive parents did in raising their child,
    and to show them i am alive and well and feel no ill will toward them. if they
    wish to have no further contact with me, i will not force the issue. but this
    is my own affair, and i do not need to follow the advice of anyone outside my
    own famiy, however well-meaning you may be. barbara lee, adopted child ----------

    what in god''s name is happening to this world? i just read in the newspaper that
    a 32-year-old man in east dubuque, ill., was convicted of strangling his wife
    during an argument. he killed her in the presence of their two daughters, who
    were 8 and 10 years old at the time. he was originally charged with murder. however,
    after the court ruled that the daughters were too young to testify, the charge
    was reduced to voluntary manslaughter. he served 20 months of the four-year sentence
    and was released. fourteen months later, the illinois appellate court in elgin
    gave him custody of his two daughters, who are now 10 and 12! i am hoping that
    you will print this in order to generate a response from the general public protesting
    the court''s decision. horrified in st. paul'

    the letter from "shocked in colorado" prompts my first letter to you. i can top
    her bizarre tale of a double-dealing lover. i met a handsome man in october 1983.
    "john" said he was married, so we had to be "careful." he was so charming, i couldn''t
    resist him. john would come to my house for lunch and "whatever" twice a week.
    in december of ''88, i happened to see his car pull into an alley behind a strange
    house. (by this time i had caught him in several small lies and had begun to mistrust
    him.) i obtained the address and phone number of this house. i called and a woman
    answered. when i asked for john, she acted so strange i knew he was there. to
    make a long story short, i called her again, and the two of us got together. this
    is what we learned: john had been seeing her for five years, too-just three days
    longer than i had. she gave him breakfast and i gave him lunch. he never called
    us by our names-he called us both "luv." he took us to the same places out of
    town and had given us identical gifts and cards for the holidays. he''d phone
    us in the evening: he couldn''t talk, but we could, so he''d tap on the receiver-two
    taps for "yes" and one tap for "no." abby, i gave this man five years of my life-so
    did she. i still hurt a little, but it''s a relief not having to cheat and slip
    around anymore. would you believe that this woman and i lived within a mile of

    re. the guest who had been deliberately kicked by a 4-year-old "bully": you suggested
    that the guest ask the child why she was kicking her-thereby opening a dialogue.
    what if the child persisted in kicking her? my wife and i recently had dinner
    with a friend and her 3-year-old son at a small pizza place. we ordered a large
    pizza for all of us to share. the child started handling the antipasto, taking
    a piece, putting it back on the plate, trying another, replacing it, etc. he ignored
    his mother''s directives to stop. i was particularly distressed because the child,
    who had a cold and a runny nose, kept rubbing his eyes and his nose while sorting
    through the antipasto! i asked him to please stop touching the food unless he
    was going to eat it. he ignored me, so i moved the plate out of his reach and
    told him that he should not handle food that other people might want to eat. my
    wife was very upset with me for having disciplined her friend''s child. could
    i have handled it better? in the doghouse in clark, n.j.'

    you reach more people in your column than anyone i can think of, so please publish
    this. baby sitters who sit in a parent''s home and earn more than $50 during a
    calendar quarter must pay social security tax and income tax on their earnings,
    if the parent who employs them chooses to claim a child care credit on her tax
    return. why? because in order to claim the child care credit, the parent must
    fill out a "form w-10 dependent care provider''s identification and certification,"
    which lists the baby sitter''s name, address and social security number. if the
    parent decides to claim the child care credit, the baby sitter''s pay should be
    increased enough to cover the resulting taxes (at least 32 percent) when federal,
    state and social security taxes are figured in. when you consider that the child
    care credit is only 20 percent to 30 percent (depending on your income) of the
    amount actually paid out for child care, wouldn''t it be less expensive for everyone
    if the parent decided not to claim that credit? a kentucky taxpayer'

    my daughter and her husband have come to visit for two weeks. they live in a distant
    state and have been married for two years. they have been here for five days.
    during this time, my daughter has gone out with a former boyfriend three evenings-once
    from 9 p.m. until 4 a.m., the next two times from about 3 p.m. until 1 a.m. my
    son-in-law knows this and doesn''t seem troubled by it, which leads me to believe
    they have some kind of an arrangement. he has also gone out-i don''t know where
    or with whom, but he always gets in early. i recognize that they are adults, but
    it bothers me. i can''t stop my daughter from "seeing" anyone, but this doesn''t
    seem proper, and i wonder what my legitimate rights are. is it reasonable to expect
    her not to spend most of her time with an old boyfriend? perhaps they are just
    friends, but if so, it seems that she came here for room and board, brought her
    husband along for the trip, and she''s doing what she wants to do-which is seeing
    her old boyfriend. should i speak to her about it? i don''t want to jeopardize
    our relationship. am i being an old-fashioned mother? should i just keep quiet

    this? am i reacting normally? uneasy mother'

    thank you, thank you for publishing the letter from "no name," the battered husband.
    while i do not deny or condone the reality of abused women, it''s high time we:
    a) start referring to "spouse abuse," b) recognize that "spouse" can and does
    include the husband, and c) recognize that abuse can be verbal and emotional as
    well as physical-regardless of the abuser''s gender. in my own case, after tolerating
    years of physical and emotional abuse in the futile hope that my ex-wife would
    change, two things woke me up. the first was the realization that i was nearing
    the point of physical retaliation. the second was when her assaults began to turn
    against our 1-year-old son. the day she began throwing things at him and screaming
    that she hated him, i took the boy and what personal possessions i could carry,
    and walked out. i may have allowed her to manipulate me and abuse me, but she
    was not going to do it to him. by then i was emotionally drained and close to
    a breakdown. however, through treatment and counseling for depression, and with
    the support of family and friends (who had seen it coming long before i did),
    i regained my self-esteem and will sufficiently to fight and win the ensuing custody
    battle. it was an uphill fight, and the legal expenses very nearly finished me.

    a while back you had a letter in your column from someone who wanted to know if
    it was okay to ask "who else will be there?" before accepting or declining an
    invitation. there could be a good reason. i am a 56-year-old successful professional
    woman with a rather unusual handicap i''ve never been comfortable disclosing to
    others: i am unable to remember the names of casual friends and acquaintances.
    once a person has been identified for me, my memory of that person returns, and
    from then on, i''m fine. i have a good memory and function well in other areas.
    i have been psychoanalyzed up one side and down the other, so i know this condition
    isn''t caused by emotional problems. when i attend a social event, if i know in
    advance who will be there, i can recognize them. otherwise, i must wait until
    someone uses their name, which doesn''t always happen. this has caused me endless
    embarrassment. i cannot very well say, "who are you? i''ve only seen you 100 times."
    so, please, abby, don''t condemn those who ask, "who else will be there?" draws

    my wife had some cousins visiting her from a distant state. they are nice people,
    but apparently they had never been to a classy restaurant. well, we took them
    to one. they ate heartily, then just before we left the restaurant, one of the
    cousins emptied the entire contents of the breadbasket into her oversized purse!
    there were rolls, breadsticks, a few muffins and some crackers individually wrapped
    in cellophane. she even took all the packets of artificial sweetener! when she
    saw the look of disapproval on my face, she said, "there''s nothing wrong with

    with dismay and anger, i read the samples you published of announcements some
    people sent out regarding divorces. you seemed to find them cute. however, since
    your opinion is important to so many people, i don''t think you should endorse
    jokes made out of a tragedy such as divorce. you have said in your column that
    divorce is like a death in the family. what if you had received an announcement
    like this one from a woman who had been unhappily married and whose husband had
    just died: "at last, floozies, booze and tobacco finally caught up with marvin
    last tuesday, when he slipped peacefully to his undeserved reward. you are invited
    to help me start spending his insurance money at a champagne celebration next
    june 31, at 6 p.m., 123 swing drive, anywhere, usa." poor taste, isn''t it? so
    are divorce announcements. at age 69, i am going through a divorce from my 72-year-old
    husband. i was a good and faithful wife. i never neglected my appearance, but
    he is going through a delayed midlife crisis and wants a divorce, and there is
    no way i can prevent it. i am devastated. i wish i could find one of those capsules
    that causes instant and painless death because i would be too chicken to shoot
    myself. this letter to you is my announcement-my only one. i doubt if you will
    publish it, but i had to tell someone, and i can''t think of anyone else. mrs.

    the recent allegations against house speaker jim wright have set the stage for
    him to defend his conduct, and contrary to the pundits of cynicism, republicans
    and democrats alike demand that he be treated with fairness. but since the speaker''s
    difficulties have prompted a more fundamental inquiry into the ethical standards
    of congress and washington in general, americans who join the understandable cry
    to raise those standards should also demand fairness from reformers who wield
    a machete instead of a scalpel. one of the serious charges in the wright investigation
    is that his wife obtained a job due to her husband''s position, an allegation
    the speaker has vehemently denied. the tragedy is that the mere mention of possible
    nepotism has sent shock waves through washington and now threatens to destroy
    the careers of women in government service who, like myself, committed the grievous
    sin of-dare i say it-marrying an elected official. like many americans, i believe
    deeply in serving my country. when my husband (10th dist. rep. john porter) was
    elected to congress and we moved to washington, i was determined to make my own
    contribution to the nation. after working as his administrative assistant, a full-time
    position in which i received no compensation under congressional rules, i pursued
    a job with the reagan administration. throughout reagan''s presidency, i served
    at the department of energy, where i serve now as special assistant for international
    affairs. i am proud of the work i have done and the expertise i have developed
    in international energy matters. but like many other congressional wives, regardless
    of my qualifications, my days may be numbered. why? fearing a backlash in the
    media, the administration is set to announce a new policy that would exclude congressional
    spouses from consideration for any government post that requires senate confirmation.
    while i understand the intent, in practice this tells women who aspire to government
    careers: if you''re married to a member of congress, you needn''t apply here.
    in a nation founded on the premise of opportunity, what kind of message is that
    to send to qualified women who want to further their careers in public service?
    at a time when women have realized greater gains and contributed more than ever
    before throughout society, why should we now be penalized for sharing our lives
    with men who share our commitment to work in government? if such a standard were
    carried to its logical conclusion, ourchtr0236 date: 0/50/28 zone: c slug:abby

    i have a neighbor/friend who comes over for coffee every day after she gets her

    she is having an affair with a friend of her husband''s. she says she has no major
    complaints about her husband, but she never really knew what love was until she
    and this man found each other. (he''s also married.) how i wish she hadn''t told
    me. we''re really not that close. she never asks me for advice; she just wants
    to talk. i really don''t want to hear any more about her romance, but i don''t
    know how to shut her up. i feel very guilty keeping this from my husband, but

    is there a discreet way to find out if a dating partner has been circumcised?
    i am a young woman who intends to remain celibate until i marry. i have recently
    learned from the various medical literature that there is a much higher risk of
    cervical cancer and vaginal infections in some women whose husbands have not been
    circumcised, so this is very important to me. obviously, this is much too personal

    what do you think of a man (my husband) who, in my presence, informs his 16-year-old
    son from a previous marriage that although certain body parts of mine have deteriorated
    and become less attractive due to childbirth and aging, he would still (not unlike
    a martyr) rather have sex with me than a younger, firmer woman with whom he would
    run the risk of contracting aids? the message i received was that i was no longer
    attractive to him, and that he just "puts up with me." since then, i don''t enjoy
    sex with him as much as i used to. also, i feel that my privacy has been invaded.

    rate. in two generations she will have been responsible for 182 people! this number

    so, daddy doesn''t send the support money! well, i am one daddy who has sent $2,000
    a month for the support of my two children, but mommy tells them that their father
    is a rich but stingy man who doesn''t give her enough money to support them. abby,
    in addition to the $2,000 a month, i pay tuition and transportation to their boarding
    schools. (mother does not work, but she sends the children to boarding schools
    anyway.) at christmastime, i give each child $1,000 for clothes, but they don''t
    see a penny of it because their mother keeps putting off taking them shopping
    for the clothes. last easter, the children were put on a plane to spend the holiday
    with me, and they arrived looking like a pair of ragamuffins. i am sure this letter
    could have been written by many fathers, so you can sign it: divorced dad, anywhere

    else you need to know if you''re planning a wedding can be found in abby''s booklet,

    my problem is too embarrassing to discuss with friends or family, so here goes:
    i am a single, 40-year-old professional woman who enjoyed being single until last
    year when i met "barry." he is my age-also a professional person-and we hit it
    off the minute we met. we love each other very much and plan to marry soon. well,
    barry gave me an engagement ring last week, but i''m not wearing it for two reasons.
    first, it has a 14-karat gold mounting, and i must be allergic to the metal because
    i started to break out on my finger after wearing it for only a few hours. also-and
    i know this is going to sound terrible, but i''ll be perfectly honest-that ring
    is a terrible disappointment. abby, it''s one-fifth of a carat. barry said he
    insured it for $500. i am a large woman with large hands, and this diamond looks
    so small you need a microscope to see it. if that''s all he could afford, i wouldn''t
    mind, but this man is very successful-i''m talking a $200,000-a-year income! is
    there anything i can (or should) do about this? i would like a ring i can be proud
    to wear. disappointed'

    lasts 20 or 30 minutes. i can''t handle this stress. i have no desire to see any
    old boyfriends. all my friends tell me i am crazy for believing him. am i? insecure

    thirty-eight years ago, i crocheted a tablecloth as a wedding gift for my husband''s
    sister. (i''ll call her charlotte.) i asked my mother-in-law to deliver it to
    her because charlotte and my mother-in-law lived in the same neighborhood. i never
    received any kind of "thank-you" from charlotte, and i didn''t have the nerve
    to ask my mother-in-law if she ever delivered the tablecloth to her. well, abby,
    after all these years, i visited charlotte, and there on her dining room table
    was the tablecloth i had crocheted for her. i was delighted to see it there, and
    exclaimed, "my, how lovely that tablecloth looks on your table!" charlotte replied,
    "thank you. i just love it. my mother made it for me." abby, i was shocked speechless,
    but i never said a word. this has really bothered me, but since my mother-in-law
    has been dead for several years now, i saw no point in telling charlotte that
    i had crocheted that cloth for her and asked her mother to take it to her. what
    do you think should be done about this misunderstanding after all these years?

    but still in love with scorpio. scorpio knew i was dating pisces, but pisces didn''t
    know about scorpio until last easter when pisces stayed too long and scorpio showed
    up early at my house. needless to say, i felt terrible about it, because i knew
    i wasn''t being fair to either one of them. i finally told pisces that i couldn''t
    see him anymore-it was over. i really didn''t want to end it with pisces, but

    i can relate to the lady who said she stayed on her side of the bed for 40 years
    because her husband hardly ever took a bath. i have been in the same boat for
    years. i threw hints at my husband for years, but it did no good. finally, in
    desperation, i said to him, "honey, you stink!" it was like talking to a brick
    wall. i''m a good cook and keep a clean house, but this man refuses to keep himself
    clean. he must be used to the smell, but i''m not. i''ve slept by myself and cried
    myself to sleep because he doesn''t think i''m worth taking a bath for. the sad
    part of it is, i love this man, and he''s the only one i want to give my love
    to. i''m 50 and still ache to have his arms around me and give me a little loving
    once in a while. i''ve never looked at another man and have no desire to. oh,
    i''d settle for a hug and a kiss, but if i try for it, it turns him on and makes
    him want to have sex, and i can''t go that far because he smells so bad. i can''t
    win. the only time he ever was clean enough to love was when he was in the hospital
    and they bathed him. so what can i do, abby? missing love in indianapolis'

    this is an open letter to all who have treated me kindly when they have driven
    by me while i''m on my bicycle: thank you for giving me a little extra room even
    if i have to ride in the lane instead of on the shoulder. you obviously realize
    that either the shoulder is soft dirt, or it has glass and junk on it that you
    can''t see at 55 mph but i can see at 10 mph. thank you for not being impatient
    when it takes you an extra moment to get past me. thank you for not crowding me
    into the curb when there is no shoulder-as you know, sometimes the sewer gratings
    are set several inches below pavement level and might be just the right size to
    catch my tire and flip me into your path. thank you for not making left and right
    turns into me, but according me the same courtesy you would any other driver.
    thank you for patience when i ride after dark. sometimes i don''t have a light
    and my clothing isn''t bright enough, which is stupid, but maybe i''ve been caught
    unawares and didn''t expect to be out after dark-maybe i had a flat, or misjudged
    my distance or the time. and i''m grateful when you don''t turn on your bright
    lights in my face. thank you for not honking your horn, or seeing how close you
    can come short of hitting me (for the fun of it), or yelling or shouting obscenities
    when you drive by as though i had no right to be on the road. please be considerate
    of me, automobile driver. when gasoline costs $5 a gallon, we''ll all be on bicycles.

    with all the stepfamilies in today''s society, maybe your answer can benefit others
    with the same problem. "ira" and i have been married for seven years. when he
    married me, i had two children, ages 2 and 3 years old, from a previous marriage.
    ira is the only father my children have ever known. now, my problem: whenever
    we are with my mother-in-law and she introduces us to anybody, she says, "this
    is my son, ira, his wife, mary, and mary''s two children," emphasizing the fact
    that they are my children, but not ira''s. these children are her grandchildren;
    they call her "grandma." i have told ira that i am hurt by his mother''s behavior,
    and since he has been a father to these children since they were infants, he should
    ask his mother to please refer to them as "our" children, which is the way ira
    refers to them. ira says his mother doesn''t mean anything by it, and i am being
    too sensitive. meanwhile, she continues to hurt me this way every chance she gets.
    what do you suggest? mary'

    my 27-year-old stepdaughter, "julia," is having a large, lavish wedding, which

    toward me because i was the "other woman" in her father''s life while she was
    growing up, which caused her mother much pain and unhappiness. (her mother died
    a few years ago; otherwise, obviously, she would be co-hosting the wedding with
    james.) i was not mentioned on the invitations (i.e., "mr. and mrs. --- request,"

    goes. i feel that out of loyalty to me, james should insist that we be treated
    as a couple, but he is bowing to all of her demands. it has occurred to me to
    skip the wedding, but james thinks i should be bigger than that and "rise above

    disturbed everybody in the house and gave me a constant headache. my husband refused

    i am a 31-year-old female, married nearly five years (no children), and have been
    having an affair for several months. late last year i realized that i was not
    happy. my husband started a new consulting job at that time and worked every evening
    until 9 or 10 p.m. and all day saturday. i saw less and less of him, and felt
    lonely and frustrated. we argued a lot and i kept telling him i was not happy.
    he told me if our marriage did not work out it would be because i wasn''t understanding
    enough-that he was working for our future. innocently enough, i asked one of my
    clients to a client appreciation luncheon. we had a wonderful time, and after
    i left him, i felt something deep within my heart for this man. i passed it off
    as "flirting" fun; then he called me a few days later and invited me to lunch.
    i felt like a schoolgirl again. to make a long story short, more lunches followed,
    and i knew he was special enough to risk my marriage for. that''s how our affair
    began. now i know that i love this man and want to spend the rest of my life with
    him. the problem is that i really do love my husband and don''t want to hurt him.
    how did this happen? how can i be in love with two men? is my affair true love,
    or am i substituting the lack of love at home for an exciting affair with another
    man? we both decided to end our affair on the last day of 1988. it didn''t work.
    we saw each other again because we couldn''t stay away from each other. the guilt
    is killing me. meanwhile my husband is working so hard he doesn''t seem to notice.
