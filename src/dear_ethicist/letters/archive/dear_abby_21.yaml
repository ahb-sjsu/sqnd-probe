    friends of ours, "cindy and josh," are moving a few states away and throwing a
    goodbye party for themselves. are my husband and i required to take a gift to
    the party? they were married a few months ago, and we were very generous with
    their shower and wedding gifts. josh has been unemployed for more than a year.
    according to cindy, he doesn''t like to job-hunt, so he''s waiting for something
    to "fall in his lap." on the other hand, cindy has a well-paying, full-time job.
    they live rent-free in a house his parents own, and spend their money on sports
    memorabilia, stereo equipment, electronic gadgets, etc. neither one has a job
    waiting in the city where they''re relocating, but they were given money by cindy''s
    parents to cover moving expenses and rent for the first few months. cindy is hinting
    broadly that she expects cash as gifts. i thought gifts were required only at
    housewarmings -- not farewell parties. however, my husband doesn''t want us to
    appear cheap. your thoughts, abby? -- questioning couple in missouri'

  body: 'dear readers: yesterday my column was composed of letters i received in just
    one day about alcoholism. today, for readers who may be concerned about their
    drinking, i am printing a wake-up call: are you an alcoholic? 1. have you ever
    decided to stop drinking for a week or so, but lasted only a couple of days? 2.
    do you wish people would stop nagging you about your drinking? 3. have you ever
    switched from one kind of drink to another hoping that would keep you from getting
    drunk? 4. have you had a drink in the morning during the past year? 5. do you
    envy people who can drink without getting into trouble? 6. have you had problems
    connected with drinking during the past year? 7. has your drinking caused you
    trouble at home? 8. do you ever try to get extra drinks at a party because you
    did not get enough to drink? 9. do you tell yourself you can stop drinking any
    time you want, even though you keep getting drunk? 10. have you missed days at
    work because of the drinking? 11. do you have blackouts? 12. have you ever felt
    that your life would be better if you did not drink? 13. when you take one or
    two drinks, can you stop and walk away? 14. have you ever embarrassed yourself
    or someone else when drinking? 15. do you drink every day? 16. how many times
    in the last month have you awakened with a hangover? 17. do you spend money you
    don''t have on alcohol? 18. has this affected your sleeping habits? (do you pass
    out, get a drink in the middle of the night, or wet the bed when you sleep because
    of alcohol?) if you have answered yes to four or more of these questions, you
    are either an alcoholic or on your way to becoming one. so, now what do you do?
    for openers, go to your telephone directory and look up the listing for alcoholics
    anonymous. it is listed under "a." they charge no dues and you need not identify
    yourself unless you want to. another excellent group, women for sobriety inc.,
    was mentioned in my column yesterday. if a 12-step program is not for you, talk
    to your doctor about a referral for other treatment options.'

    every year for 15 years, i made the same resolution –- to curtail my drinking.
    i knew the only way was to stop completely and i was determined to do it on my
    own. i had a strong will and didn''t understand why i couldn''t stop. (at times
    i thought i really didn''t want to stop.) finally, i checked into a hospital and
    now attend aa meetings. at one meeting, i heard a definition of "insanity" as
    doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different result. it was then
    that i realized the difficulty i had with battling alcohol was actually my strong
    will. on one side it was telling me i had to stop (i knew i had to and wanted
    to), while at the same time it was telling me i couldn''t do without it. see the
    dilemma? please, abby, let readers know that feeling you have a "weak will" or
    asking for help is not a sign of weakness. no one will think less of you for asking.
    for me, it was well worth it. i haven''t had a drink for 39 months and am finally

    my dear husband passed away two months ago. we had been married for 26 happy years.
    when people in the neighborhood or in town see me, they say, "you are doing great,"
    or "you look wonderful," and "how are you feeling?" i know people don''t know
    what to say at a time like this, but how should i reply? although my clothes are
    clean and my hair is combed, don''t they realize i am heartbroken? am i supposed
    to weep and tear my hair in public? i may look strong, but inside it''s all applesauce.
    if people feel awkward, can''t they just say, "i think of you often," or "i''m
    glad to see you"? please tell me how to respond to these pollyannas who think
    i''m just peachy. -- grieving privately in florida'

    after a long and happy marriage, i became a widow three years ago, and am soon
    to marry an old family friend, "vernon." his wife was a dear friend of mine who
    was killed several years ago. vern and i are trying to get our personal business
    in order ahead of time, so there will be no ill feelings among our adult children.
    when i die, i will be buried next to my first husband, and vern with his late
    wife. my question is, how should my name appear on the headstone, considering
    the fact that i plan to become "mrs. vernon jones" when we marry? my son is upset
    that i''d give up the "smith" family name. i don''t want to create friction between
    my son and my new husband, but i do plan to take vern''s last name and am surprised

    for the past eight months, i''ve been involved with a wonderful, kind-hearted
    man who showers me with affection and says he loves me. i''ll call him hank. hank
    likes the idea of kids and family and is very family-oriented, as am i. my main
    concern is he has trouble keeping a job. his pattern has been that he finds a
    job but only works for a short time, then something always happens, and he either
    gets fired or laid off. we had started planning our wedding, but my family doesn''t
    like him, and that –- on top of his job situation –- has put a lot of stress on
    me. i finally told hank that i won''t marry him until he proves he can support

    moms and dads sang "auld lang syne." a good time was had by all. the next day,

    i, too, am a surgeon. frequently people -- usually women -- approach me at parties
    to ask about some medical problem they''re having. the "problem" is usually minor
    and most often dermatologic, though knowing i''m a thoracic surgeon, they''ll
    occasionally mention a chest problem. such questions never bother me, for after
    all, i know more about medicine than any other subject, so if appropriate, i offer
    a straightforward answer. on other occasions, choosing my "victim" carefully,
    i''ll tell her, "go into the bedroom, take off all your clothes, and let me know
    when you''re ready." fortunately, no one has ever taken me up on my facetious
    offer. the usual responses are, "may i take my drink along?" and "who will referee?"

    the letter from "harassed m.d." reminded me of a joke i heard years ago: a physician
    and an attorney were discussing the problem of people seeking their professional
    opinions at parties. "what do you do?" asked the physician. "i usually give them
    the information and then send them a bill," replied the attorney. five days later,

    last evening, our 20-year-old son, "roger," brought a young lady home for us to
    meet. her name is "sally"; they met in a class at the local college. i know as
    well as i know my own name that our son is going to ask his dad and me, "well,
    what did you think of her?" -- and therein lies my problem. my husband and i aren''t
    sure if we should be honest with roger about our first impression of sally. perhaps
    we should tell him to let us get better acquainted before passing judgment. we
    have even considered staying completely neutral. after all, if roger ends up marrying
    her and it doesn''t work out, we could be accused of trying to influence him.
    this is the first time our son has ever brought a female friend home for us to
    meet. roger and sally seem happy together, and that''s all that counts. however,
    his dad and i also know our son is looking for our approval -- especially mine.

    now that the holidays have come and gone, i am once again wondering about the
    proper etiquette for thanking people for gifts. when i was growing up, my mother
    insisted that after each christmas and birthday i write detailed thank-you notes.
    of course, notes are in order for gifts received in the mail, but what about presents
    opened in front of the giver? when i have children, i imagine mom will expect
    thank-you notes from her grandkids. on the other hand, i have friends who say
    that a sincere, verbal thank-you is sufficient, and sending notes to people who
    have already been thanked is overkill. please tell me if a handwritten note is

    i''m employed as a legal assistant in a law office with two other people: my boss,
    "jerry," and my co-worker, "evelyn." before reading further, please understand
    they are not having an affair. my problem is that jerry shows extreme favoritism
    to evelyn. some examples: (1) jerry threw an elaborate party for evelyn on her
    birthday and did nothing for mine, even though he was aware of the date. (2) he
    purchased an "employee incentive" package from an airline to reward "deserving
    employees" with air miles. within six months, he awarded all of them to evelyn.
    (3) he ordered business cards for my co-worker and none for me, even though we
    are both his assistants with the same title. (4) i suspect jerry gives bonuses
    to evelyn and not to me -- that are based upon the "good work" that both she and
    i do for the firm. (5) he''s flying evelyn and her boyfriend first-class to cancun
    to attend a seminar with him. (6) evelyn and i both exceeded our allotted vacation
    time last year. jerry made me pay back the extra vacation days i took, but didn''t
    make the same request of her. i realize that evelyn has been a legal assistant
    for many more years than i have. however, it''s obvious that our boss out-and-out

    i need to know if i''m being unreasonable. a few nights ago -- around 3 or 4 in
    the morning -- my husband got into bed and woke me to have sex. i had only been
    asleep for a few hours. he knows i have to get up for work by 7 a.m. it''s not
    the first time this has happened. when i tell him i need my sleep, he gets mad
    and says i''m rejecting him. then he gives me the silent treatment. abby, i have
    never been a morning person and have always needed my sleep. this is a recurring
    problem that affects other parts of our relationship. my husband and i have been
    married 15 years and have quarreled continuously over his "nocturnal needs." i
    should add that he is unemployed and can sleep any time he wants. how do you suggest
    i get my hubby to be more considerate without hurting his feelings? -- sleep-deprived

    my 78-year-old mother has a shopping problem. it''s been going on for as long
    as i can remember. i used to organize yard sales once or twice a year to clear

    had a nice selection of new stuff for sale. now that i have moved away, my sister
    is left with the mess, and there have been no more yard sales. isn''t "binge shopping"
    considered addictive behavior? our mother is hooked on the home shopping network,
    as well as the sales racks at her local stores. we have pleaded with mom to stop,
    but she always replies, "you might as well dig a hole and stick me in it now!"

    phooey! on that word "love"! seventy years ago, when i was in my early 20s, i
    was engaged to a man who swore he loved me with all his heart. he did -- until
    i became very sick. that was the end of our wedding plans. years later, i met
    a man i thought was interested in a mutual friend. i was shocked when he invited
    me to dinner and a movie. during dinner he said, "i''m not an articulate person."
    "that''s ok," i flippantly replied. "neither am i!" we saw each other often after
    that and time seemed to fly. then i had an attack of pain that came without warning.
    my doctor advised immediate surgery. when i told my friend, he listened, then
    put his hands on my shoulders. in a voice choked with tears he said, "i like you.
    will you marry me?" i was so astonished i couldn''t speak, for we hadn''t even
    kissed, as unbelievable as that seems. "you do like me, don''t you?" he asked
    anxiously. "yes," i whispered. i got no further because i was stopped by our first
    kiss. i''m a widow now, and more than 90 years old, nearing the end of my life''s
    journey. please tell "feeling hurt" that a happy marriage can be built on two
    people "liking each other" at the start. my husband of almost 50 years didn''t
    say "love" a dozen times, but by his actions, faithfulness, consideration and
    dozens of ways, he proved -- not only to me, but also to the world -- that he
    did. now i only want to be with him. -- missing my mate in arizona'

    my daughter, "jenny," is engaged to marry a nice young physician. it''s going
    to be an elaborate "black tie" affair in a castle in europe. the young man''s
    family is enormously wealthy, and his siblings are all doctors or lawyers. some
    of the wealthiest people in the world will attend the wedding. on the other hand,
    our combined income is less than $30,000 a year. we pay our bills on time, but
    we have nothing extra at the end of the month. the good news is that the groom-to-be''s
    family has contributed a lot of money toward the wedding. the bad news is that
    they''re asking me why we haven''t contributed any. our daughter mentioned that
    some of her friends'' parents have taken out a second mortgage on their homes
    so they can give their daughters their dream weddings. (we live in an apartment.)
    jenny hasn''t lived at home for 12 years and makes more money than i ever will.
    abby, what is expected of me and my family? how can we explain to jenny that we
    are happy for her and love her, but cannot and will not use our small retirement
    savings to pay for her elaborate extravaganza? as it is, we will all have to travel
    to her castle, and pay for hotel rooms, tuxes, plus give them a lovely gift. we

    i am 32 years old and have been divorced for about three years. my five-year marriage
    was a disaster. when my husband wasn''t cheating, he was putting me down, telling

    better now. i moved away and found a good job, and am once again at peace with
    myself. at the end of each workday, i enjoy going home, watching tv, turning in
    early -- then getting up for work in the morning and doing it all over again.
    the problem is that my family is worried about me. on weekends, i go home on friday
    night and don''t leave my apartment until monday morning. i am content with my

    we have a close family friend of nearly 40 years. i''ll call her becky. she is
    nearly 80 years old and has no living relatives. becky considers us her "family,"
    and the feeling is mutual. the problem we''ve run into is that becky still lives
    by herself and continues to drive -- which she shouldn''t be doing. she has had
    10 wrecks that we know of in the past seven years. the most recent one totaled
    her car, and she promptly bought a new one. becky has bad hips and legs, which
    has reduced her ability to walk or climb stairs. also, last month there was a
    knock at her door late one night and she opened it without first looking through
    the peephole. becky was robbed at gunpoint. we have spoken with her several times
    over the past few years about moving into an assisted-living facility. however,
    becky is one stubborn lady and doesn''t think "those places" are for her. we disagree.
    becky depends on our family for everything, as though we are blood relatives.
    since we''re not, we cannot legally do anything to improve her situation. i speak
    for everyone in my family when i say we fear if becky continues on the path she''s
    on, she will not live much longer. is there any advice you can offer on this sad
    situation, abby? -- afraid for our family friend in dallas'

    my husband comes from a family of practical jokers. when i first married "vince,"
    i tolerated it. however, after my sister-in-law, "vicki," sent a stripper to my
    office as a birthday surprise, i asked her politely and firmly to stop. all my
    request did was provoke her to continue hounding me and to escalate the jokes.
    her last "joke" was the last straw. vince and i had planned a dream vacation to
    europe. vicki called our travel agent and attempted to cancel it over the phone.
    she had our confirmation number and my credit card information. it''s lucky that
    i''m close friends with the travel agent, who knew it wasn''t me. thinking we
    were victims of a credit card scam, she ended the call and contacted me at work.
    besides nearly costing us thousands of dollars in unrefundable travel costs, we
    realized that vicki had snooped through our personal belongings. how else could
    she have obtained my credit card numbers and the confirmation number for the trip?
    we canceled all our credit cards, had new ones issued, and warned vicki that we''re
    thoroughly checking all of our records. this has caused a huge rift in the family.
    while my in-laws agree that what vicki did was wrong, they insist in the next
    breath that we shouldn''t take it so seriously, and we need to have a sense of
    humor. vince and i are standing firm that vicki is no longer welcome in our home.
    she has never apologized and seems to enjoy showing up at our house, forcing us
    to deny her entry. how can we get her to stop harassing us, and how can we get
    the family to recognize the seriousness of this? -- ticked off in houston'

    i have a different sort of pet peeve, but i hope you will let me air it. if you
    do, i''m sure it will generate a collective sigh of relief from a few million
    tv watchers -- and hopefully, a station manager or two might take notice. the
    weather reports all start with the terrific computer-generated maps and diagrams
    presented by both local and national tv meteorologists. however, they insist on
    standing in front of their display and waving their arms madly around, which is
    distracting, infuriating, and adds zilch to the report. a typical example: the
    weather reporter announces the temperature in boston is 74 degrees, then he walks
    across the screen to point at the number on the map. then the reporter shows how
    a front is moving from the southwest, following the station manager''s instructions:
    "crouch low, sweep arms around crazily and move to the center of the screen. stand
    in front of the home city data. smile proudly. point out the local forecast because
    the map is now completely obscured." why can''t the old rubber-tipped pointers
    used by our grade school geography teachers (who stood thoughtfully off to the
    side while lecturing) be retired from the chalk trays of america and put back
    into service? unlike little children, tv weathercasters should be heard and not

    i suspect it was a maneuver to force us to attend the dinner party. we asked him
    to reschedule the lunch, told him the dinner party was too expensive, and asked
    if he would make the $10 gift optional. are we unreasonable, or is he? -- wondering

    it''s time for that brother and his wife to grow up and learn to budget their
    own money. if "able''s" mother and sister aren''t willing to put their money where
    their mouths are, they should keep quiet. it never makes sense to loan money to
    a bottomless pit. strange, how "able," the responsible son, is criticized, while
    the spendthrift, spoiled son runs to mom and sis to lay guilt and put pressure
    on the responsible brother. if the situation were reversed, would the big spender

    i would like to share my pet peeve with you. it''s being invited to "sales parties"

    so-called parties because i have three children to feed. i would prefer not to
    disclose my financial situation to every person who issues these invitations,
    which arrive sometimes on a weekly basis. i have tried to tell friends that i
    am busy that night, and they either find out that i really don''t have plans or
    try to sign me up for an "outside order." i have shared with a few friends that
    i am on a strict budget, and they reply with "just come and don''t buy anything."
    that''s not a workable solution, because the consultants see the word "no" as
    a challenge and won''t take "no" for an answer. also, it''s intimidating to see

    i recently attended several soccer practices for 6-year-olds. one boy on the team,
    "timmy," is so obese he can barely run. his mother screams at him from the sidelines,
    giving him directions every few minutes. sometimes the poor child "runs" in the
    wrong direction and scores for the opposing team. (i personally believe he suffers

    belly and huge thighs prevent him from running. one can see his frustration. after
    the game, each player is given a paper sack of refreshments. one time, it was
    a chocolate cupcake, a bag of chips and a cold drink. at the end of the game,
    after the snacks, timmy ran to his mother. he was crying. she was talking on her

    paper. when i asked her not to, she denied doing it. the next day, she started
    copying down my answers word for word. this time, i asked her if she would like
    to pair up and work together. she sneered at me and told me to get my "help" from
    the teacher. i told the teacher then, and the teacher replied, "she is having
    trouble with her work and personal problems at home. just imagine if this math
    was hard for you." the girl has adhd. should i continue to let this girl copy

    my 16-year-old daughter went to a party at a frat house where she was given a
    great deal to drink. feeling "woozy," she went outside. one of the "boys" she

    her own age. also, she prefers dark-haired men, so she keeps asking me why i married
    a blonde. keith earns enough so that i can stay at home with our two children.
    aunt marge says i''m selfish to make him carry the financial burden alone. (neither

    marge has always been a homemaker. she hasn''t worked a day since she married

    earns, and what we do with it. aunt marge stops by unexpectedly a lot, usually
    at night. if i''m wearing my robe and nightgown, she demands to know why. then
    she asks why i took my shower so long before bedtime. she also constantly criticizes
    the way i wear my hair. aunt marge gets upset because, when keith is home, we

  body: 'dear readers: today is thanksgiving, the time we pause to consider the blessings
    for which we are grateful. in many homes across this great nation of ours, turkeys
    are being stuffed -- just as the people who consume them will be later in the
    day. but for many individuals, today and the holidays that follow can be an intensely
    difficult time, triggering feelings of stress, loneliness and loss. if a person
    is prone to depression, these feelings can be further magnified. how can anyone
    feel depressed at this time of year? you ask. it''s not that far-fetched. people
    who are separated from their families often feel isolated because they can''t
    celebrate in the traditional way. families who have lost a loved one during the
    year often feel the absence especially at this time. others become depressed because
    they imagine that everyone else is enjoying a warm, idealized family experience,
    while they are on the outside looking in. even people who enjoy the holidays can
    find them stressful. this is a time of year when people are stretched for time,
    energy and money -- particularly the latter. they may become embarrassed because
    they can''t celebrate the way they would like to celebrate, or in the style they
    have in years past. some ways to ward off the holiday blues: -- keep expectations
    reasonable. don''t take on more activities than you can handle -- financially
    or otherwise. -- don''t overspend. plan a holiday budget and live within it, regardless
    of the temptation. -- do not run up credit card debt, or january will be like
    a serious hangover. -- and speaking of hangovers: watch your alcohol intake. remember,
    although alcohol seems to be a mood elevator, it is actually a depressant. if
    you have a problem with alcohol, get whatever support you need to make it through
    the holidays. a final thought: if you''re feeling down and want an instant "upper,"
    the surest way to accomplish it is to do something nice for someone else. call
    someone who lives alone and invite that person to dinner. better yet, say, "i''m
    coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get safely home." (some older people
    don''t drive at night, and those who do might prefer not to be behind the wheel
    after dark.) give it a try! you''ll be glad you did. and now, i''ll repeat the
    traditional thanksgiving prayer that was penned by my mother, pauline phillips,
    years ago. my thanksgiving would not be complete without it: oh, heavenly father,
    we thank thee for food and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember
    the sick. we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee
    for freedom and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service,
    that thy gifts to us may be used for others. amen. p.s. we have so much for which
    to be grateful this thanksgiving day. those of you with a little time to spare,
    how about showing our gratitude to veterans by visiting a veterans hospital and
    raising the spirits of those who have served our country? happy thanksgiving,
    everyone! -- love, abby'

    had four major relationships in my life. the last two have ended with their deaths.
    the first -- my late husband -- died in a work-related car accident. the second
    died of an aortic aneurysm. dale has proposed marriage and i said yes; however,
    my doubts are linked to the adage, "it comes in threes," and i''m afraid i''ll
    lose him too. if this seems silly, i''m sorry. i loved both of the men who died,
    and after the last one i swore never to love like this again. however, god says,
    "never say never." can you help me? -- gun-shy in phoenix'

    bryna, he gets put-down after put-down. she "comments" about his acne and also
    his teeth. i am no longer married to her son (he''s deceased), and while we were

    in 1996, in memory of a 19-year-old battered woman who was murdered by her boyfriend,
    you printed an item requested by her family. it changed my life. on march 29 of
    that year, my dad said, "i have something for you," and handed me your column.
    it contained a list of 15 warning signs of a batterer. it was my wake-up call.
    at first i thought, "how can this help me?" well, it did. no. 1 took me back to
    the beginning of my relationship with my fiance. by the time i reached no. 15,
    i had reviewed the past seven years of my life. few realize how important a role
    verbal abuse and criticism play in an abuser''s efforts to gain control and keep
    you from leaving. the verbal abuse was harder for me to deal with than being kicked
    in the back when i''d walk away from one of his outbursts. after reading that
    column, i finally understood there was nothing i could change about myself that
    would make him love me. thank you, abby. i wish i could let the family of the

    wishing me well on my healing, swearing genuinely by her husband''s talents as
    a healer. three months and nine days later, the scar is still there, and on a

    now face expensive plastic surgery or dermatological work if i want to be rid

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am struggling with a family problem that could permanently break the bonds with
    my parents. i am a dentist, married with a family, who followed my father''s footsteps
    into the profession. after five years working at my father''s practice, i purchased
    the practice at full market value. when this happened, our roles were instantly
    reversed. i was now running the show. over the next six years, i took the practice
    in new directions. my relationship with my parents became more strained and distant
    as they saw me become more successful. father is now retired, and recently needed
    to have two crowns redone. although my parents'' dental care is free, there was
    an outside laboratory bill for the fabrication of the two new crowns that came
    to about $300. i asked my father to pay the lab bill. i thought things were all
    right until my mother came in for a routine cleaning a few weeks ago and called
    me every name in the book. she couldn''t believe i would charge my own father
    for his dental work after raising me as their son. what should i do? i told my
    mother i''d pay the lab bill myself. am i wrong on this? my parents and i seem
    to have completely different views. -- d.d.s. in deep doo-doo'

    my son was invited to a birthday party. when i called the mom to rsvp, i asked

    i was married nine months ago to a man i love dearly. it has been an adjustment
    for all of us, and at times it has been stressful. we have been working on some
    issues, but for the most part we''re doing well. i have a 12-year-old daughter
    i''ll call "ginger." the problem is my new father-in-law, "grant." he lives alone
    a few states away from us. we see him only a few times a year. i barely know him.
    grant has been asking to take ginger alone for a weekend at his secluded home.
    i have a real problem with that. grant also asked to take ginger to visit his
    mother -- an even farther distance. he planned on having my daughter alone with
    him in a hotel for a week. i said no. abby, grant plans these outings in his head
    and then gets upset when i say no. i''m not comfortable allowing my innocent child
    to spend time alone with a man in his 60s whom i don''t know very well. i have
    invited grant to our home so he can get to know us both, and he always has an
    excuse not to come. this is causing a rift between my husband and me. grant has
    made my husband feel guilty, and it has caused arguments between the two of us.

    really wanted out of life is to become a mother. i feel that is the reason i was
    born female, and i wouldn''t be able to forgive myself if i died without giving
    birth. i also don''t want to become a mother in any other way except the "old-fashioned

    i was divorced after only eight years of marriage. i raised my son, "bart," alone.
    we have always had a close relationship, except for the normal ups and downs during
    his teen years. bart is now a successful adult in his late 20s, working professionally
    in a nearby suburb. he usually calls me once or twice a week and drops by for
    dinner a couple of times a month. i look forward to his visits and our heart-to-heart
    chats. we share a similar sense of humor and many interests, including gardening.
    bart has had several girlfriends in the past, but has been dating a lovely new
    woman for several months. she is a sweet, bright young lady with whom i get along
    very well. in recent months, whenever bart visits, his girlfriend always comes
    along. she rarely joins in the conversation and seems only to sit there waiting
    for us to "finish" so they can be on their way. our talks have become brief and

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my younger brother, who is 53, recently lost his job. his wife has never worked.
    they have spent their life traveling, driving expensive cars and entertaining
    lavishly. they never saved a nickel. i, on the other hand, have always lived frugally.
    my wife and i put our kids through college, we live in a modest home, drive older
    cars and have never vacationed outside the united states. we have saved diligently
    and plan early retirement in a year or two. my mother and sister think we should
    help my brother and his wife out by lending them money that we know will never
    be repaid. my brother has put me down for my thrifty ways, saying i could die
    tomorrow, then what good would all that money be? well, tomorrow is here. my wife
    and i are prepared for whatever life may deal us in the future. mom and sis are
    angry that we refuse to give money to my brother and his wife. they made their
    bed -- now they can lie in it. abby, please tell me if i''m right. -- able but

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my problem is my neighbor''s home basketball court. the parents are oblivious
    to how far the noise travels. my ears are constantly assaulted by the thump, thump
    and screaming of children that goes along with the game. it''s impossible on most
    days and evenings to sit on my porch and read a book, or in my living room without
    closing the windows. most people hate to complain to the offending neighbors because
    they''re nice people, even though they are clueless. zoning board members: how
    about outlawing basketball hoops in neighborhoods where there''s less than 500
    feet between houses? give us a break. as taxpayers, we''re assessed to provide
    bigger and better playgrounds and school gyms. that''s where basketball hoops
    belong. driveways shouldn''t supersede the local playground. please, parents,
    unless you live on a lot that''s an acre or larger, take down that horrid noisemaker
    and take the kids to the playground. show some consideration for your neighbors.

    a treasured friend of my mother''s -- a lady who knew me from birth (i am now
    56) -- passed away recently. i was brought up to call her "auntie." she was closer
    to me than some of my blood relatives. my children and i adored her. we called
    her long-distance, sent her flowers on special occasions, and saw her every time
    she came to town -- which was two to four times a year. finally it was necessary
    for her to go to a nursing home. the last time we went to visit her, the nurses
    said, "oh, didn''t you know? she passed away a month ago!" her only son lives
    far away. he never bothered to call and notify us. we had to find out the hard
    way. abby, our number was in her current phone and address book. we were never
    given the opportunity to mourn. her son didn''t think enough of us to even pick
    up the phone. he knew we loved his mother and that we included her in all our
    family gatherings. i''m sad and angry at his lack of compassion. auntie had four
    husbands die on her. we loved them all and called them "uncle," and planned all
    the funerals with auntie''s son in full agreement. so what could have been the
    problem? abby, won''t you please remind your readers again to call dear friends
    about a death in the family? this is inexcusable. we are ... mourning in tacoma,

    for 35 years i have been married to the most manipulative, cunning, critical man
    ever born. "homer" gets what he wants by using "helpful hints," offering "advice"
    and telling me "what''s best," and sometimes even getting blue in the face and
    crying. he is very good at it, never quite overplaying his hand. he wears me down
    until i finally give in. by using this technique, homer has made sure that we
    live where he wants to live, vacation where he wants to go, drive the car he likes,
    and have even decorated our home in his preferred colors. during the first years
    of our marriage, i gave in because i loved him. later, i did it to avoid an argument.
    now i do it out of habit. i loathe homer for making me a doormat, and i loathe
    myself for allowing it to happen. homer will be retiring after the first of the
    year with a very nice annuity, which i feel i have earned, too. i have a small
    pension, but it''s too small to live on my own. i don''t know if i can bear homer''s
    company 24/7, but can i really start again at 65? everyone calls us the "perfect
    couple," but i am miserable and he is driving me closer to the door. i have often

    my mother-in-law, "sharon," and i had a wonderful relationship until i gave birth.
    almost overnight, sharon became extremely overbearing about how i should raise
    her grandson, "charlie." (he is now 8.) recently, charlie contracted a common
    childhood illness. although i had been taking him to the pediatrician regularly,
    sharon kept insisting that i wasn''t caring for him properly. one afternoon when
    she was baby-sitting, she went so far as to take charlie to his pediatrician and
    tell the doctor that i wasn''t treating his illness. when the pediatrician didn''t
    tell sharon what she wanted to hear, she took charlie home with her and gave him
    some medicine she had at her house. when i found out, i was horrified. (what if
    he''d had an allergic reaction?) when i called sharon to discuss the matter, she
    hung up on me. so i sent her an e-mail and told her how devious i thought she
    had been, and that she was no longer welcome to baby-sit charlie at her house,
    although she could visit him at our home if she wished. no response. two days
    later our doorbell rang. it was a visit from child protective services. charlie''s
    pediatrician had to be contacted as well as his school counselor. it was very
    embarrassing. after an investigation, the matter was dismissed. sharon has never
    denied that she called cps, nor has she made any effort to apologize. my husband
    and i have no wish to speak to her until she does. are we right to avoid her,
    and should we wait for her to come to us? we hate to be in a feud, but we worry
    that she may try something like this again if she doesn''t see there are consequences
    for her actions. -- embarrassed in new york'

    please settle an argument i''m having with my wife. our 18-year-old daughter,
    "crystal," suffers from adhd. last june, my wife insisted that crystal get a summer
    job. after weeks of searching, the only job crystal could find was selling door-to-door.
    i was afraid that this door-to-door sales might put my daughter in danger, so
    i quietly approached the owner of a small business nearby and paid her to give
    crystal a job. crystal did well, and it turned out to be a positive work experience
    -- her first for someone non-family. my wife just found out what i did, and she
    is irate. i didn''t tell her because she is such a penny-pincher -- she complained
    about piano lessons for crystal during her senior year because "she was going
    to college anyway." is what i did so terribly wrong? i think it was a good thing.

    my son works at a place where the employees celebrate birthdays by gathering for
    cake. one young employee seems bent on learning everyone''s age. although many
    people are reluctant to state their age, he persists with his questions to the
    point of embarrassment. abby, our son was a victim of downsizing and recently
    joined the group. his birthday is in early november, and he is dreading their
    "celebration" because he is over 50 and fears his supervisors will think he''s
    too old for advancement. how should that young man''s question be handled? --

    six months ago, i met a great guy i''ll call joe. things have gotten serious and
    we have discussed living together. a couple of weeks ago, joe spent the weekend
    at my place. when i got up to prepare breakfast, i was shocked to see him walk
    through my front door after retrieving my newspaper -- stark naked. i live in
    a wooded area with few neighbors. joe had to stroll down a long private driveway
    to the public street to get the paper. anyone could have seen him. there are little
    kids in the neighborhood. to top things off, it was chilly outside and raining.
    i asked joe why he went outside naked in the rain, and he tried to shrug it off
    as no big deal. he replied, "i didn''t want to get my clothes wet." i haven''t
    been able to think about anything else for days. i''m considering breaking up
    with him over this. joe seems perfect in every other way. he''s handsome, successful
    and even-tempered. i live in a small town and can''t risk my reputation by being
    in a relationship with the local flasher. he thinks i''m making a big deal out
    of something innocent. what should i do? -- mortified in minnesota'

    i am one of your male readers. i posted my profile on an internet site for singles.
    the site contains a significant amount of personal information. all the information
    i entered was accurate except for my age. i said i was six years younger than
    my chronological age. i did it for two reasons: first, i neither look nor act
    my age. i take excellent care of my body and my chronological age doesn''t reflect
    who i am. second, individuals conduct a search based on only two parameters --
    the age range desired and geographic location. thus, many women would never view
    my profile because i would fall outside the age range considered acceptable. i
    had sent and received several e-mails from a delightful young lady. at one point,
    she asked me whether the age listed in my profile was accurate. i immediately
    told her the truth and the rationale i had used for listing myself as younger.
    she immediately informed me that she was no longer interested in communicating
    with me because i had lied. was i wrong to list an age in my profile that wasn''t
    accurate, even though i am more youthful than most people my age? -- looking for

    my boyfriend of four years, "harold," and i are starting to discuss marriage and
    starting a family. i am hesitant because of one thing: we have very different
    views about disciplining children. my parents never used violence as a form of
    punishment, and i don''t want to use it to discipline my kids. i think that other
    methods of discipline work just as well, without destroying the bond between parent
    and child. when harold was young, his father would discipline the kids by hitting
    them with a belt. harold sees nothing wrong with this, although the only argument
    seems to be, "i turned out ok." this is only partially true. both harold and his
    brother have big anger management issues. i love him and would love to spend the

    school in 1996. in 2002, chrissy ran into an old high school boyfriend who was
    addicted to drugs and has psychological problems. she fell back in love with him,
    and soon they were dating. he was insecure about her having friends, especially
    someone of the opposite sex, so he gave her an ultimatum -- him or me. she chose

    i have gotten to know her son and have treated him like he was my own. i do anything

    i am fluent in french and english. i want my daughter, "chantal," to speak both
    languages. i am in a relationship with a man ("clark") who has three children
    who live with him full time. i am wondering if speaking french to chantal in front
    of clark and his children is rude. my daughter''s first language is french, and
    i have always conversed with her in french. this has been a point of contention
    for some time now. i have asked clark to make an effort to learn french, but he
    has no desire to, nor do his children. there is a "closeness" factor, i believe,
    in sharing my mother tongue (my mother is french, my father american) with my
    daughter, and i would like to carry it down the generations. clark says i can
    talk to chantal in french when we''re alone, but that wouldn''t be often. what
    do you think? is this worth ending the relationship? -- franco-fille in the u.s.a.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    you printed a letter from a woman, "uneasy about my daughter," who was concerned
    that her husband might be acting inappropriately with her 11-year-old daughter.
    she went on to describe her husband sitting on the toilet and eating his dinner
    every night while the girl took her bath, and also stroking the girl''s backside
    to lull her to sleep at bedtime. you advised "uneasy" that her husband''s behavior
    was inappropriate and urged her to discuss the situation with the girl''s pediatrician.
    you said the husband might back off if he heard from the doctor that what he was
    doing was wrong -- and that the doctor should report the man if he refused to
    stop. abby, i think you threw gas on the fire without knowing more about that
    mother''s concerns. why is the husband eating his dinner while the daughter takes
    her bath? does he get home late, after the rest of the family has eaten? how developed
    is the girl? my 11-year-old girl looks like she''s 8! is the father really rubbing
    the girl''s bottom -- or her back? a back rub isn''t inappropriate. eleven is
    a weird age. the girls aren''t women, but they aren''t small children either.
    my 11-year-old thinks nothing of jumping into the tub when i''m bathing my 3-year-old.
    she also does it when my husband is bathing our son. if "uneasy" feels the way
    she does, why doesn''t she have her daughter take her bath earlier? -- trusts

    and show ned where i''ve planted them. without fail, in the middle of summer when

    i went to wake up my 14-year-old daughter today and discovered her sleeping in
    the nude. apparently she has been doing it for some time. normally she is good
    about getting up, and i haven''t needed to enter her room to waken her. when i
    asked her why she does it, she said it''s more comfortable and she sleeps better.
    when i told her i was not comfortable with it, she asked me why, and frankly i
    could not come up with a good reason other than it seemed "wrong," and fear about

    last week i kicked my husband out of the house. "joel" and i have been married
    four years and have a 3-year-old son. two years ago, joel took up with "connie,"
    a 20-year-old single co-worker. he insisted they were just friends. when i found
    love letters from connie in his wallet, joel swore the letters were not from her.
    (oh, come on!) things got messy when i started checking my husband''s cell phone
    bill and discovered he was calling connie several times a day. upon checking further,
    i learned that some of his co-workers also thought something was up. when joel
    learned i''d been asking questions, he became very angry. then connie started
    calling him at the house at all hours. once, around midnight, she got into a tangle
    with some guy and instead of calling police, she called joel -- who rushed right
    over. since then i have caught joel in more lies about where he was going. i have
    also caught my husband and his "friend" parked in empty parking lots and dead-end
    streets. he says he doesn''t want a divorce, but every time we talk, we end up
    fighting because he tries to twist the facts around to make me look like a fishwife.
    should i wait it out to see if joel will come home to his son and me? or should
    i cut him off, divorce him, and pray that god will send me a man who will give
    me the respect and love i deserve? -- spurned wife in texas'

    i have been married to "nick" for 14 years. we have a beautiful 10-year-old daughter,
    "betsy." i recently learned that when nick was between the ages of 15 and 19,
    he molested his younger sister. my husband is now 48 and swears that, during those
    years, he was a "messed up, suicidal" teen. all this was recently revealed by
    the sister, who is now 42. she told her parents who, in turn, wrote an ugly letter
    to nick. i opened it by mistake and, unfortunately, read it all. it shocked me
    to the core. i feel so sad for his sister. nick will be seeing a counselor to
    work through what happened 30 years ago and to try to put everything in perspective.
    i know he is not the monster his sister describes, and i know he would never hurt
    betsy. i wish i could just smooth everything over. how do i explain to betsy that
    her grandparents will never visit again? nick is considering moving out to distance

    do you think it is appropriate for a brother (age 21) and a sister (age 17) to
    share the same bed? the siblings each have a large, comfortable bed of their own,
    but frequently wind up sharing. this is very troubling to a dear friend of mine,

    a few years ago, i noticed some porn in my mom and stepdad''s room. i didn''t
    mention it to anyone. later, my older sister accused my stepdad of window-peeping,
    but no one believed her. last summer, i noticed him outside my window when i woke
    up one morning. i didn''t say anything because i didn''t want to cause a problem.
    i have never liked my stepdad. he is verbally abusive. you wouldn''t believe what
    i hear every single day. i share a bathroom with one of my sisters. last year
    when it was remodeled, we noticed a gap between the floor and the basement. (we
    covered it with towels when we were in there.) last week, i noticed what looked
    like a piece of wood in the gap, so i decided to give it a closer look. it looked
    like the lens of a camera. when i took a flashlight into the basement and checked
    it out, i found a cable running through the room and got close enough to see it
    said "camera" on the back. it faced the toilet. i don''t know who to tell, or
    if i should. my sister deserves the right to know -- but who else would believe
    me? i''m just a stupid 14-year-old girl. if i tell my mom, she will kick my stepdad
    out, and i''ll have to go and live with my dad. i''ll have to change schools.
    i''ll lose my boyfriend, my friends, my life. mom could lose the house because
    my stepdad mainly brings in all the money. i should have said something when i
    saw the porn. i feel like this is all my fault. if i don''t say anything and it
    keeps on, it could get worse -- and i''d probably commit suicide from the stress.

    last year, my husband''s pet rabbit, "blossom," died. my husband -- i''ll call
    him "edwin" -- went into the back yard to feed blossom one morning and found her
    lying dead in her cage. he gave blossom a little funeral and buried her in our
    yard. later that day, our neighbor''s dog dug up the rabbit. when the neighbor
    came home for lunch, he found the little body on his doorstep. thinking his dog
    had killed blossom, he panicked. he ran out, bought another rabbit that looked
    just like blossom, and placed her in our cage. when edwin returned from work that
    night, he was stunned to find the rabbit sitting in its cage munching a carrot.
    he rushed over to blossom''s grave and, of course, found it empty. edwin immediately
    concluded that a miracle had occurred -- blossom had returned from the dead. ever
    since, my husband has treated the rabbit like a little deity. he built an altar
    for her and puts flowers on it every day. he sits in front of her cage in the
    lotus position and talks to her. when i come around, he stops talking until i
    leave. the neighbors have since moved, but last week i ran into the wife and she
    told me the story i have related to you. thinking it might help edwin, i repeated
    the story to him. he became irate and accused me of trying to ruin the only miraculous
    thing that had ever happened to him. (his mother had a spider that danced to chopin
    etudes, so wackiness runs in the family.) should i insist that edwin seek counseling,

    my problem concerns what to do with a group of snapshots and a bundle of about
    100 old love letters that i''ve hidden for more than 50 years. if they are found
    after my death, my heirs will be shocked. i have treasured these mementos in my
    heart since i received the first, before i was shipped overseas in world war ii.
    the letters continued up to december 1947 -- and in ''98 and ''99 i received three
    more that were ultra-special. they are the sincerest of love letters from the
    girl in the photographs. family interference separated us, even as we were planning
    to be married. of course, life went on. i met my wife and we were married a few
    years later, but i could never bring myself to destroy the letters or the photographs.
    after half a century, i searched and found my first love. then in 1999 we were
    able to locate our son, who was born and placed for adoption after we were separated.
    the three of us have spent some special time together. even though we acknowledged
    that our love was and still is true, we agreed not to upset my marriage. my wife
    knows all about this, and accepts my strong need to financially help my "other
    girl" have a comfortable lifestyle. i love my wife. she is and always will come
    first in my life. yet those photos and letters are precious to me. genealogically,
    they are vital family memorabilia, and without anyone knowing, i have placed them
    with five generations of saved items. they represent an important part of my life
    with my first love. i cannot find the courage to let them go. have i done wrong?

    intense feelings. seeing robb with angela every day is torture. the school counselors
    suggested i immerse myself in something to get my mind off robb -- sports, drama,
    my studies -- anything. i tried for months, but it hasn''t worked. i can barely
    function because i''m so miserable and lovesick. a few days ago, angela told me
    she doesn''t like robb as a boyfriend as much as she used to and would really
    rather be good friends with him. but she doesn''t want to hurt his feelings. i
    want to tell her how i feel about him, but i can''t bring myself to do it. what
    if she laughs at me or tells me he''d never like me? i might kill myself. please
    help. i don''t know how much longer i can live with this pain. -- lovesick in

    a good friend of mine recently wrote and self-published a book. it is comprised
    of anecdotes, poems and short essays. she asked if i liked it, and i (coward that
    i am) told her i liked a couple of the stories and thought the book was quite
    good. i lied. the book is horrible. i thought it was just me -- but when i shared
    it with a few others, they felt the same way. much of what she wrote reflects
    strong negativity about her job as a social worker, the people she''s there to
    help, and the children she taught as a substitute teacher. i want to tell her
    my true feelings, but everybody tells me to keep quiet. that may not be fair to
    her. she''s starting another book, and i think she should know the truth. how
    can i tell her without hurting her feelings or insulting her? her friendship means
    a lot to me. -- ''lil white lie'

    i am divorced and the father of two girls, ages 6 and 5. i am actively involved
    in their lives. my ex-wife, "erin," is a teacher, so i pick the kids up from school
    and watch them until dinner every night. erin and i separated in 2001. she started
    dating the following july, and by august, my 6-year-old told me that mom''s "friend
    from high school" was sleeping in her bed and taking showers in the morning. i
    was furious. i told erin that what she did when i had the kids was her business.
    but when the kids were with her, her boyfriend should not spend the night. she
    told me her bedroom was no longer any of my business. the sleepovers continued,
    and in november, erin informed me that her boyfriend had officially moved in.
    she claims that this is a loving and committed relationship -- but they have broken
    up twice that i know of in the past six months. i am legally powerless to fight
    this, but i think that in addition to being confusing and unsettling for our daughters,

    made our visits few and far between. could the mother have done something to alienate
    the son-in-law? my marriage has lasted 12 years. however, the times in my life
    when i quit communicating with family were when i was undergoing severe marital
    stress and depression, and didn''t want to discuss it or pretend all was well
    when it wasn''t. in a more drastic scenario, my niece cut out family visits for
    years. when we saw her at christmas, she''d barely speak to family members. she
    recently divorced, and now we have learned she had been in an abusive marriage.
    i do think "lonesome" and her husband should pay a drop-in visit occasionally.
    her instincts may be "heads up" for some reason. keep the visit brief in case
    the daughter''s college schedule is on overload. that way, they can see, talk
    to, and hug their daughter and new son-in-law -- and while they''re at it, scope
    out the situation. dropping off food is always a good excuse for a quick visit
    or, if there''s time, invite them out for dinner. mom could also send her daughter
    a phone card to save them money. mom should be sure no strings are attached, and
    her daughter and son-in-law know it can be used to call anyone they need to. i
    also strongly recommend the internet. mom and dad should learn how to do instant
    messaging: ask a quick question, want an answer, gotta go. these quick messages
    let parents know their offspring are alive and well, and allow parents to be involved
    -- at least a little -- in their children''s everyday lives. -- alice in vine

    why don''t "lonesome" and her husband get weekend tickets to a play or sporting
    event at the college, and go there to have dinner and see a show once a month?
    that way they''ll get quality time with their daughter, and there will be less
    stress over time management for the couple. after all, she''s both a student and
    a newlywed, and that''s a lot to handle. also, in my experience, cell phones dramatically

    i have a heads up for "lonesome." newlyweds may not want to come home for the
    weekend. they''re happily enjoying their time together. here''s how my in-laws
    handled it 17 years ago: if they hadn''t heard from us for a few weeks, they''d
    call and say, "is there a day in the next couple of weekends when we can come
    and take you two out for brunch or dinner? pick a place you''d enjoy." or, they''d
    pick up some food from one of our favorites and we''d have a picnic at our place.

    my husband, "ollie," and i are in our late 40s and have been married 25 years.
    the first five were rocky, but we made it work -- and then the children came along.
    ollie has become so controlling i can hardly breathe. i work 55 hours a week.
    my only extravagance is buying coffee and a snack and lunch at work a couple of
    times a week. ollie demands to know where every penny goes and what i''m "wasting"
    it on. abby, i don''t do drugs or gamble, and i''m not a shopaholic. but grocery
    and household costs have risen. ollie does none of the shopping, refuses to go
    with me, and denies that prices have gone up. we are not destitute. he has his
    own business. i am emotionally drained. he refuses to go to counseling. the moment
    i get home in the evening, he starts berating me. our kids are in high school
    and usually scatter when he starts yelling. he isn''t hitting me, but i feel beaten
    emotionally. i get a lump in my throat and my chest constricts when i try to figure
    out what to do. can verbal abusers become physical abusers? i find myself working
    longer hours so i don''t have to come home, but i''m afraid he''ll start on the
    kids if i''m not there. should i see a lawyer? without outside intervention, how
    can we survive? -- tired of the battle in michigan'

    i was recently invited to a baby shower for an acquaintance. as she opened her
    gifts, a girlfriend sitting next to her wrote down the name of the gift-giver
    and the item on a sheet of paper. at the same time, this friend was also penning
    thank-you notes to each giver! at the end of the shower, the mommy-to-be signed
    each note, "love, ''x''" -- and handed them to each giver. how should a person
    react to something like that? my first reaction was that this woman should receive

    my husband, "ned," lost his mother suddenly at the age of 54. her wishes were
    to be cremated and have her cremains scattered in the arizona desert. it hasn''t
    happened yet. her cremains started out on the bookcase headboard of our bed. i
    finally moved them to the living room in front of the fireplace. one day, i returned
    home from work and, once again, the cremains had been put back in our bedroom
    -- this time on the nightstand next to our bed. abby, our 10-year-old son was
    extremely close to his grandmother. they adored each other. to this day, he talks
    to the urn as if it is his grandmother. in addition, the cremains did not all
    fit into the urn, so a second box was sent along with the urn. with time, the
    box has separated and started to leak. i think it''s unhealthy to continue to
    have the cremains in the house, and i also feel it''s disrespectful to my mother-in-law.

    "unwilling stepmother" seems to be more like a child than an adult. when she became
    serious with her fiance, how could she not realize that his little girl would
    be a big part of her life? "unwilling" needs serious family counseling, or to
    get out of there. she also seems to have no clue about child development. most
    3-year-olds have a very self-centered view of life. they must be lovingly taught
    to become giving as they grow. i married a man with two children eight years ago.
    as part of our marriage vows, i promised to love his children as my own. it wasn''t
    easy, but today i am reaping the rewards of having two wonderful stepchildren
    and one biological child. i became very ill after the baby was born, and who do
    you think was always there to help? yes -- both of my stepchildren. i love them
    as my own and could not imagine life without them. "unwilling stepmother" is missing

    my son and his wife have two children, a son, age 7, and a daughter, age 5. every
    day when my son leaves for work, he drops his son off at school. before they leave
    the house, he takes his daughter to the bathroom and then she is locked in her
    bedroom until her mother gets out of bed. i have tried telling them that this
    isn''t right. to me, it is very dangerous -- and probably illegal -- to leave
    a young child locked in a room unattended. i also worry that it may cause psychological
    damage. could you please give me some words that i can pass along to them? they

    i recently met a lady i''ll call gloria. we have been spending time together and
    enjoy each other''s company. last week, she invited me to her home for dinner.
    while i was eating, she excused herself from the table and returned a few minutes
    later with her pet cockatiel, "bogart," on her shoulder. after she sat down, she
    placed a morsel of food in her hand and lifted it to her shoulder so bogart could
    eat. next, she put some food in her mouth, and with the bird still on her shoulder,
    exposed the tip of her tongue (which had another morsel of food on it), and proceeded
    to let bogart peck the food off her tongue. finally, she craned her neck toward
    the bird as if delivering a passionate kiss, while bogart inserted his beak between
    gloria''s lips and withdrew a shred of food. i enjoy gloria''s company very much,
    but we are only at the beginning of a relationship. abby, does being a pet lover
    have any bearing on what is appropriate at the dinner table? and what are the
    health implications of intimate contact with one''s bird? i have had pets in the
    past that i loved. but they never sat at my table, nor did they insert any part
    of themselves into my mouth to retrieve snacks of any kind. was what gloria did
    acceptable behavior at the table? -- nauseated in olde virginny'

    was adopted by the second continental congress in philadelphia. the resolution
    for the declaration was introduced june 7, 1776, by richard henry lee. do you
    know who seconded the motion? john adams -- who would later become our second
    u.s. president. any idea how many states he was president of? (i confess, i had
    to call the public library to find out.) there were only 16 when john adams took
    office. do you know who wrote our declaration of independence? a committee of
    five. thomas jefferson is credited with writing most of it, assisted by john adams,
    benjamin franklin, robert r. livingston and roger sherman. and was it enthusiastically
    adopted? heck, no! the congress "suggested" a number of changes -- and you can
    imagine how poor jefferson felt about that. (about the same as any author who
    has to report to an editor.) do you care to know how many changes were made by
    the "tweakers"? eighty-six. (it makes one wonder if that''s where the term "eighty-sixed"
    -- slang for someone or something ejected or rejected -- originated.) the lee-adams
    resolution of independence was adopted on july 2, 1776. the declaration, which
    gives the details of the resolution, was adopted on the evening of july 4. so
    why don''t we celebrate on july 2? beats me -- happy fourth of july one and all!

    i am a 33-year-old single mother of two, in the process of moving to a new state

    two years ago i got involved with a man who was going through a divorce. i''ll
    call him tom. our relationship was great. we got along well and enjoyed each other''s
    company. shortly after i learned i was pregnant, he left me to go back to his
    wife. it has been a constant game of back-and-forth ever since. our son arrived
    in june, but tom has made no effort to help support me or the baby. however, he
    has made an attempt to see his son. i live with my parents, work and go to college.
    they threaten to kick me out because i talk to tom and want our baby to know his
    father. i wonder if i should let him see the baby, if i should try to move out
    on my own, or if i should stay here and continue to live under my parents'' control.
    do you think it is fair for them to give me an ultimatum? on the one hand, i don''t
    think it''s right to keep him from seeing the baby; on the other, it''s not right
    that he doesn''t help with support or anything. what advice can you offer? --

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    with independence day approaching, i''m asking for your help in reminding your
    millions of readers about the danger of fireworks, especially to the eyes. each
    year during fourth of july celebrations, thousands of adults and children are
    seriously injured as a result of fireworks and pyrotechnic devices. many of the
    injuries affect eyesight, permanently damaging -- and in some cases blinding --
    the victims. in response, the american optometric association (aoa) urges people
    to refrain from using fireworks and to instead enjoy professional displays. about
    two-thirds of fireworks-related injuries are burns. most of the burns involve
    the hands, eyes, head and face. almost half of the victims are under 15 years
    of age, and 75 percent of them are male. the most frequent cause of fireworks
    injuries requiring trips to the emergency room is sparklers. (did you know that
    sparklers can heat up to 1,800 degrees, enough to melt gold?) a sparkler can also
    literally poke someone''s eye out. this may come as a surprise, but bystanders
    are also not safe from injury. data from the u.s. eye injury registry reveals
    that half of all fireworks injuries occur to bystanders. so, on this fourth of
    july, members of the aoa urge your readers to protect their eyes by avoiding fireworks
    and enjoying professional displays from a safe distance. -- dr. wesley pittman,
    president, a.o.a.'

    i had a problem similar to the one described by "stressed out by mom," the college

    is why she called in the first place), i''d mirror her complaint back to her so
    she didn''t receive the positive feedback she was seeking. when she said, "your
    sister doesn''t know how to save money," i''d reply, "so what you''re saying is
    my sister doesn''t know how to save money." however, when she said something positive,
    like, "isn''t it a lovely day?" i''d be sure to give her all kinds of positive
    feedback. "it sure is! i''ll bet your marigolds are really blooming now!" it worked
    like a charm and preserved my relationship with my mother. she quickly lost interest
    in the topics that didn''t bring positive feedback, and we''d end up talking about
    all kinds of interesting things. this method is tried-and-true. it''s based on

    junior high school, this is described as "going out." i know they kiss. they also
    dance together at a local hangout on saturday nights. i could refuse to drive
    them to the movies together, but they would probably meet there anyway. chris
    has a level head on her shoulders. she''s a good girl and active in our church.
    we talk openly together. abby, can you guide me in this? i trust my daughter,
    but i am also aware that 14- and 15-year-olds have a lot of raging hormones. please
    advise. -- wishes kids came with handbooks'

    from fourth to ninth grade, i attended a small christian school in delaware. it
    was a great experience because the teachers and the students were able to really
    get to know one another. one of the teachers, mr. c., was one of the best a student
    could ever hope to have. learning was fun in the subjects he taught, especially
    u.s. history. can you imagine taking a class of 20 on an overnight camping trip
    to gettysburg? while talking to my mom, who was a co-teacher with mr. c., about
    an upcoming business trip to asheville, n.c., mom mentioned that mr. c. lives
    there and encouraged me to try to find him. well, it turned out that mr. c. was
    the only mr. c. in the asheville phone book. we spent a wonderful afternoon reminiscing
    about his days as a teacher and mine as a student. although i don''t remember
    much about the subjects he taught, i will never forget the time he spent with
    us -- laughing while we played football on the playground, crying when a classmate
    passed away. he was always there for us. one of his favorite lines was: "don''t
    hurt him! he is the only one we have like him!" now that i work with children,
    i find myself using his favorite phrase. abby, please encourage your readers to
    take the time to look back and thank those teachers who made a difference in their
    lives. they helped to make us who we are today, and it would be rewarding for
    them to see the fruits of their labors. -- grateful in northern ohio'

    i met his sister''s friend at the same time. they didn''t talk to each other or
    even look at each other all day. jim held my hand, hugged me, and was as loving
    as always. all the while, i was cooking up ideas in my head like: maybe he goes
    over to his sister''s house and sees her, and they''re not talking to each other
    because they don''t want me to get suspicious. i have never been cheated on in
    my life by any man, yet i have been this way in all my serious relationships.

    i am being married in a couple of months. my biggest worry is that my sister,
    "virginia," will do something to ruin my wedding day. she has never been able
    to handle not being the center of attention, and has caused more scenes and dropped
    more "bombshells" than i can count. some examples: virginia announced her engagement
    to a man she had met two weeks earlier on thanksgiving. she eloped with him on
    new year''s eve -- then divorced him in a hurry so she could marry husband no.
    2 in time for valentine''s day. she has started screaming matches in the middle
    of christmas dinners, and she and one of her boyfriends had a knock-down-drag-out
    fight at a relative''s wedding reception that embarrassed our entire family. i
    know virginia''s behavior stems from deep self-esteem issues and emotional problems,
    and i feel sorry for her. but honestly, i''d like to have just one drama-free
    family event where everyone enjoys themselves instead of waiting for the next
    bomb to drop. our parents are no help. mother excuses everything virginia does
    by saying, "we need to be more supportive of her and keep our mouths shut." my
    father copes by steering clear of the whole thing. i am seriously considering
    eloping because i don''t see any other way to avoid having virginia attend my
    wedding. the sad part is, i will regret not having my parents, family and friends
    around me on my happy day. my fiance knows my sister is big trouble and says he''ll
    support whatever decision i make. any advice on how i can have my wedding cake

    i''m having a hard time dealing with an upcoming event. my husband, "rob," and

    i walked into the room just as one nephew was inviting him. abby, he jumped at
    the chance! when i asked what they were talking about, rob said, "nothing," and
    changed the subject. i don''t want him to go. this isn''t a new occurrence in
    our more-than-30-year marriage. after we were married seven years, rob came home
    from work and told me he wanted to be with other women. the men he worked with
    all had girlfriends on the side and were always talking about how great it was,
    and my husband thought he was missing something. since rob''s sister and young
    son were living with us at the time, i moved out. every day he called me at work
    to see how i was, and on the third day he called, crying, and begged me to come
    home. he had decided i was what he really wanted. twelve years later, rob had
    a stress breakdown. while he was in the hospital he confessed that he''d had a
    three-year affair with a woman he worked with and had paid for her to have an
    abortion. he said it was over and promised there would be no more women. it was
    his idea, not mine. i never mentioned the subject again. now this. abby, i''m
    having a lot of trouble dealing with this. the "boys'' night out" is in three
    weeks. i have decided to tell rob that i wish he wouldn''t go -- not can''t go

    after reading your column on how to ensure that bridesmaids'' dresses match perfectly,
    i would like to offer a different perspective. i married for the first time last
    june at age 47, and i did it on a very low budget. i would have paid for my bridesmaids''
    dresses had i been able to afford them, but it wasn''t possible. my solution was
    to simply tell my closest friends to wear what they looked and felt good in --
    preferably something blue. one friend could only afford to wear the mauve dress
    from her daughter''s wedding, so i changed my color scheme to a "rainbow" wedding.
    on my wedding day, my bridesmaids were more nervous than i was. so, after they
    helped me into my white gown and veil, i put on a white baseball cap, blew a whistle
    and gave the following pep talk: "ok, team. we''ve trained long and hard for this
    day, and it''s here. there''s tension and obstacles, but let me ask you -- have
    we got the heart? (yes!) the desire? (yes!) are we in this together? (yes!) then
    what''re we gonna do? win! win! win! yea, team!" i didn''t care if things matched
    perfectly. what mattered was these were the people i cared about the most, people
    who had a special place on our special day and enjoyed themselves. and do you
    know what? everyone looked fabulous! if i was outshined, that was ok. i still
    had the husband, bless his patient, enduring soul. a lot of our guests said it
    was one of the best weddings and receptions they had ever been to. so things weren''t

    i have two sisters-in-law. i''m the one who was chosen to write to you. our mother-in-law,

    as her sons'' children. i have tried explaining to her that we both work, and
    it takes two incomes to accumulate what we have, and her comments are hurtful.
    however, knowing she has hit a nerve whenever she drops by uninvited, she makes
    a point of commenting to me that i''m driving her son''s car, using his vacuum
    cleaner, or on how i''m raising his kids. it''s infuriating. our husbands make
    excuses that she''s old and doesn''t know any better, or say, "that''s just mom."

    slowed down. he already had a prior dui from seven years ago. from my research,

    a year ago i was placed in an emergency shelter for seven months, until i graduated
    from high school. i turned 18 three weeks ago. because of state guidelines, i
    was forced to leave the shelter and went to a foster home for a week. the shelter
    has a policy that there be no contact between the staff and clients for 18 months,
    but i was allowed to call there. last week, i got a call from the director of
    the shelter, saying i "needed to stop calling and move on with my life." my problem
    is, before i went there i had no positive support or role models, and now, when
    something good happens, i want to call and talk to one of them because i got real
    close to them. do you have any advice on how to move on with my life? -- lost

    i am being married in the fall and have asked my niece to be the only musician
    and play her violin in my wedding. she agreed to do it as a gift to me. i want
    her to purchase a bridesmaid''s dress and shoes (together about $220) so she''ll
    match the bridesmaids, as she''ll be in the front of the church. her family refuses
    to buy the dress or shoes. this has upset me and my family and caused a lot of
    tension. it is my wedding, and i feel they should accommodate my wishes. don''t
    you agree? -- hurt in kentucky'

    my name is "sunny," but i don''t feel very sunny. i''m 13 and have many problems.

    with my life. my grades aren''t good, and i keep getting myself into hot water.
    my mother has a lot of health problems, so she doesn''t need my problems on top
    of hers. i keep asking myself why this is happening to us. mother told me she
    wants me to live a life that will make me happy, and not let her poor health ruin
    my teen years. is it wrong for me to enjoy these years and plan what i want to

    my 15-year-old daughter was hired to baby-sit our friend''s 1-year-old infant.
    when she arrived, she was told she would also be watching the next-door neighbor''s
    two small children, both under 3 years of age. the parents were going out together,
    and the babies next door were put to bed, the house was locked, and my daughter
    was given a baby monitor so she could hear if there was a problem. when i heard
    this, i was furious that they''d put a 15-year-old in that position and leave
    small children locked in a house alone. i said as much. now my daughter, husband
    and our friends are all mad at me for making them uncomfortable about their "arrangement."
    apparently, they do it all the time -- both couples hire one sitter and leave
    one house unattended. these people are young, educated, drive expensive cars and
    can afford a sitter. i told them i would call social services if they continue
    to leave the babies unattended. my family thinks i owe them an apology. do i?

    i am a 30-year-old, struggling single mother. my 10-year-old daughter''s father,
    "lenny," was in prison for the first eight years of her life. he''s a career criminal.
    you name it, he''s done it. lenny''s out now, but he hasn''t changed. he wants
    to spend time with his daughter, but every time i let her go with him, she comes
    home with another story. the world is a scary place, and i feel the need to protect
    her. i''m afraid he''s exposing her to the wrong things. i also think he "works"
    while she''s around. as far as i know, lenny is still being pursued by the law
    and bounty hunters. sometimes it seems crystal clear. but then i think: lenny
    is her father. he loves her. he''s just not smart enough to be part of her life.
    legally he has no rights. his name isn''t on her birth certificate. there are
    no court orders for visitation or child support. abby, what should i do? -- torn

    i have been dating "eric" for almost six months. he''s everything i''ve ever wanted.
    there''s just one problem -- i am 26; he''s 50. eric doesn''t realize that i know
    how old he is, and i''m not sure how to tell him. we haven''t met each other''s
    families yet, but i have discussed the age difference with mine. they have accepted
    my choice because i am happy. eric is a successful businessman in our community.
    although i shouldn''t care what others think, i can''t help worrying that this
    relationship could damage our reputations. eric has a 13-year-old daughter. i
    know he''ll introduce us when the time is right, but his ex-wife has given him
    problems in the past regarding custody and visitation, and i''m scared our relationship
    could affect that as well. i am prepared to accept eric''s baggage because i care
    deeply for him, but i''m unsure how to handle some of these issues. any ideas?

    "chad" and i have been engaged for more than a year. our wedding is in six months.
    while finalizing the guest list, i discovered that chad wants to invite some people
    with whom i am not at all interested in sharing my special day. "michelle" was
    a close friend of mine through high school and college, but we have not spoken
    to each other in four years. i know michelle''s parents really like chad, and
    i remember michelle''s mom telling me that if i ever broke up with chad she''d
    like him to date michelle. chad knows michelle from high school and college only
    because he was dating me. he occasionally speaks to michelle since they are in
    the same profession, and he likes her parents enough to take the time to visit
    them when he''s in town. i do not want to come across as the jealous fiancee,
    but i am uncomfortable with the fact that he so badly wants michelle and her parents
    to be at our wedding. when i told him how i felt, he said he has known them forever
    and considers them good friends. abby, i do not consider michelle a friend at
    all, and her parents mean absolutely nothing to me and my family. this is the
    only disagreement chad and i have about our wedding. it''s important to me to
    have only people there whom i truly care about. should i put my foot down and
    deny them an invitation, or suck it up and pray they''re busy that weekend? --

    may i add a note to your response to the parents who agreed to let their daughter
    pierce her belly button, then changed their minds? i am 62 and still can''t quite
    forgive my father for much the same thing. he was old-fashioned and wouldn''t
    let my older sister drive. when i was 15, i begged to take driver''s ed and get
    my license at 16. he agreed -- on the condition that i pay for the lessons myself.
    well, i did -- and passed with flying colors. but when i turned 16, he refused
    to allow me to get my license. when i asked why he''d lied to me, he said he hadn''t
    lied. he simply thought i''d never be able to save enough to pay for the course.
    even after 46 years, i still think he lied to me. my advice to the parents: do
    not break your word. it could damage your relationship with your son or daughter
    forever. -- marj g., weslaco, texas'

    i am helplessly in love with a man who treats me like dirt. i''ll call him "brad."
    we have been together for eight years. during that time, he has told me he was
    married (he has been divorced for the past five years), and lied about having
    cancer. everything that comes out of his mouth is pretty much a lie. last year,
    brad and i had a baby girl. he wanted no part of having a baby and avoided me
    during the entire pregnancy. to top it off, when i was in my ninth month, i found
    out he was seeing someone else. he swears nothing happened. he says he just needed
    someone to talk to. for the baby''s sake, i placed her for adoption, and she is
    with a good family. now that the baby is gone, brad has come around acting sweet
    and caring. yet he still excludes me from family functions and cares more about
    his ex-wife''s feelings than mine. am i sick in the head to be in love with brad?
    how do i stop loving him and find a normal relationship? -- helplessly in love'
