    i am a 30-year-old single woman, attractive, successful (real estate) and, like
    most people who write to you, i have a problem. i have fallen in love with a charming,
    handsome 29-year-old man who my friends tell me is feeding me a line. he came
    here from ireland, his visa expired and now he is an illegal alien. my friends
    say he''s only using me so he can remain in the states and bring his girlfriend
    over from ireland. he told me about the girl back home, but says he really loves
    me and will break off with her when he can tell her in person because he doesn''t
    want to hurt her. abby, i have been in love before, but never like this. we have
    a wonderful time together, and the chemistry between us is perfect. now for the
    bad part: he has borrowed money from me--yet unpaid; i''ve caught him in several
    small lies; he drinks more than he should; and he has a bad temper. i know all
    his faults, but i am drawn to him like a giant magnet. i need an objective opinion.
    half of me says, "follow your heart," and the other half says, "forget him." what
    do you say? in love in new jersey'

  body: 'dear readers: by popular demand, here is my traditional thanksgiving column:
    tomorrow is thanksgiving day, so take a few minutes to think about what you have
    to be thankful for. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived
    this long. a lot of people haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands--maybe millions--are
    hurting more. (have you ever visited a veterans'' hospital? or a rehabilitation
    clinic for crippled children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear
    the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast
    table on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise the lord!
    a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world
    is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security.
    in fact, one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are
    you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, call someone.
    go out of your way to do something nice for somebody. it''s a sure cure for the
    blues. are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our system has
    been saved by such concern. concern for fair play under the law. your country
    may not be a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds. freedom rings!
    look and listen. you can still worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret
    ballot and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head
    or a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different
    system, you are free to go. there are no walls or fences--nothing to keep you
    here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will
    want to use it at your table tomorrow: o, heavenly father: we thank thee for food
    and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank
    thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember
    the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service, that thy gifts to us
    may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving, and may god bless
    you and yours. love, abby an afterthought: want an instant high? the surest cure
    for the post- holiday blues is to do something nice for someone. why not call
    someone who lives alone and invite him (or her) over for dinner? better yet, call
    and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." (many older
    people don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out alone after dark.)
    try it. and let me know the results.'

    i''m the mother of four beautiful children, two of whom we adopted from india
    and korea. with international adoptions becoming widespread, it would be a great
    service if you would print the following in the hope of educating some of the
    clods and well-meaning but thoughtless people out there: 1. please don''t call
    my daughter chinese. all asians are not chinese, just as all caucasians are not
    german. she is an american of korean descent and proud of it. 2. please don''t
    tell my children how lucky they are, as if they were poor little waifs in need
    of a handout. my husband and i are just as fortunate to have these wonderful children
    as they are to have us, and your attitude is patronizing. anyway, a biological
    child owes his parents even more--he owes them his life! 3. please don''t compliment
    them on how well they speak english. what else would they speak, having arrived
    in the united states as tiny infants? besides, they''ll laugh themselves sick
    at your expense in the car on the way home! 4. please give equal attention to
    our two biological children. all four will thank you--but don''t spoil it by asking
    if they, too, are adopted. after all, it really is none of your business. and
    yes, virginia, many people without fertility problems have chosen to adopt for
    other reasons. 5. please don''t tell us about your cousin, neighbor or other acquaintances
    who have adopted. we''re really tired of being stopped on the street to hear these
    tales, especially the ones that end with the woman becoming pregnant and having
    a baby of "her own" after all. 6. please spare us your speculations about what
    kind of villain their "real mother" (as the clods put it) must have been to give
    up such "cute" children. it takes a courageous and unselfish woman to give up
    a child she cannot care for, and it takes precious little character to get an
    abortion instead. besides, you''re very naive about the third world culture and
    the conditions these women faced. 7. please let us go about our business. we''re
    a family, not a sideshow, and we''re often in a hurry. my children have feelings
    identical to yours, and it makes them very uncomfortable to stand listening while
    nosy strangers quiz us about their adoptions. forgive me if i seem brusque on
    these occasions. 8. above all, myob about my children''s backgounds: why they
    were given up, if their birth mothers were married, etc. i''m appalled by how
    often i have been asked such rude questions by friends, acquaintances and even
    strangers. this information is off limits to everyone outside our immediate family,

    last year at christmas i witnessed an exchange between a salesperson and a customer
    in a department store. the store policy was to refuse to allow the customer to
    use an unsigned charge card. the customer produced various forms of identification,
    but refused to sign the card. her reason: if her signature were on her card and
    it was lost or stolen, it could be used by the person who stole it. abby, wouldn''t
    a signed credit card be more difficult to use than an unsigned one? it would be
    harder to match the signature already on the card than to match one that you put
    there yourself. this woman obviously had not thought about the fact that a person
    who would steal her unsigned card would have no compunction about signing her
    name on it. with another christmas shopping season upon us, we should all check
    our credit cards to be sure they are signed. and salespersons should make it a
    policy to check the signature on the card against the signature on the charge
    slip. usually no other identification is requested when you use a charge card.

    i am 40, divorced and have known a lot of men in my life, but this one is hard
    to figure out. a few months ago, i met a very handsome man (age 37) who looks
    a lot like tom selleck. he told me he was injured in vietnam and had a plastic
    chest. recently i spent the night with him, and it seems that the plastic on his
    body extends to a greater area (his hips and pelvis). he''s a perfect date--intelligent,
    educated and well-bred. he said he was on the football team in college and he
    also studied ballet. he loves to cook, bake, crochet, knit and do needlepoint.
    he''s an excellent dancer, owns his own business and has plenty of money. (he''s
    a "computer consultant," whatever that is.) after we made love (just that one
    time, which was just ok), i began to wonder if maybe he was a transsexual (a female
    who had had a sex-change operation). he talked a lot about plastic surgery, and
    his body looked strangely different and appeared to be patched up in many places.
    i wondered how he could have been injured in all those places and live to tell
    about it. he claimed he received many war decorations but never applied for any
    veteran''s benefit (for his injuries) because he didn''t consider himself disabled.
    i don''t plan to see him again because frankly, he left me with the creeps. i''d
    like to know the real truth about him. abby, are people who have sex- change operations
    registered anywhere so i can find out for sure? no name, please'

    i want to get a message across to architects, plumbers, construction workers and

    when one member of a family has a cold, he passes it on to the rest of the family
    in various ways. one way is by others having to use the same bathroom sink as
    the sick person. in the modern bath we now can have twin sinks, sitz baths, whirlpools
    and bidets. why can''t someone come up with a small sink just for the family to
    use when brushing their teeth? to fill a sink with water for the face, etc., after
    another member has used the same sink for brushing teeth without first having
    scrubbed the sink is comparable to fast-rinsing a spittoon. let''s push this idea,

    in recent years, we hear of more and more women who, through cancer surgery, have
    lost one or both breasts. some women are devastated. some married women fear that
    their husbands will think they are ugly--and may leave them. some unmarried women
    fear that no man will want to marry them. i''d like to share a letter my mom received
    from my dad after she had a mastectomy. maybe some husband can use it to reassure
    his wife, or some wife will realize that real love is not lost with the loss of
    a bodily part. kay hunt would you love me less? if i lost a toe, would you love

    of? a policeman is a composition of what all men are, a mingling of saint and
    sinner, dust and deity. . . . less than one-half of 1 percent of policemen misfit
    the uniform. he, of all men, is at once the most wanted and the most unwanted.
    . . . he must be such a diplomat that he can settle differences between individuals
    so that each will think he won. but, if a policeman is pleasant, he''s a flirt;
    if he''s not, he''s a grouch. . . . he must be able to start breathing, stop bleeding,
    tie splints, and above all, be sure the victim goes home without a limp--or expect
    to be sued. . . . he must know every gun, draw on the run, and hit where it doesn''t
    hurt. he must be able to whip two men twice his size and half his age without
    damaging his uniform and without being "brutal." . . . if you hit him, he''s a
    coward; if he hits you, he''s a bully. . . . he must know where all the sin is
    and not partake. . . . the policeman must chase bum leads to a dead end, stake
    out 10 nights to tag one witness who saw it happen--but refused to remember. the
    policeman must be a minister, a social worker, a diplomat, a tough guy, and a
    gentleman. . . . and, of course, he''ll have to be a genius--for he''ll have to
    feed and clothe a family on a policeman''s salary.'

    my problem is that his grown children have threatened him with complete isolation
    if he divorces her to marry me. last year he initiated divorce proceedings, and
    his children carried out those threats, so he dropped the divorce action. now
    he expects me to accompany him to the homes of his children and socialize with
    them and his grandchildren. his children want him to have a "girlfriend," but
    they don''t want their mother upset, so she is not to know about me. abby, i do

    this: a 58-year-old california woman was taking her usual early morning walk when
    she spotted a tiny toddler in his pajamas, crawling, walking and toddling merrily
    on his way down the sidewalk! she immediately called the police who came at once
    and took the bright-eyed, happy little adventurer into custody. it seems that
    sean, a 20-month-old youngster, had simply crawled over the side of his crib and
    escaped to the outside through the doggie door, wandering a half-mile from home.
    when his parents awakened at 7:30 a.m. to discover that their child was not in
    his crib, they searched the house, panicked, then notified the police. eight patrol
    cars equipped with bullhorns conducted a street-by-street search in the area of
    his home, but were unable to locate him. the parents never dreamed this could
    happen to them, but it did. could it happen in your home? by the way, they have
    not owned a pet in some time, and you can be sure that the doggie door has been
    nailed shut! now that nature has built more acrobatic and resourceful children,

    has turned our weekly trips into thoroughly disagreeable experiences. she talks,
    talks and talks until we are ready to scream. she has a loud, harsh voice, and
    interrupts constantly to turn the conversation back to some unclear personal anecdotes.

    i saw red after reading the letter from "no name," a 40- year-old divorcee, who
    had spent the night with a handsome, 37-year-old vietnam veteran and was turned
    off when she found that his body (chest and pelvic area) had been patched up with
    surgical-type plastic. he had explained beforehand that he had been "seriously
    injured" in vietnam, so she shouldn''t be shocked. she said: "he''s a perfect
    date--intelligent, educated and well-bred. he was on the football team in college
    and he also studied ballet. he loves to cook, bake, crochet, knit and do needlepoint.
    he''s an excellent dancer, owns his own business and has plenty of money. (he''s
    a "computer consultant," whatever that is.) after we made love (just that one
    time, which was just okay), i began to wonder if maybe he was a transsexual (a
    female who had had a sex-change operation). i don''t plan to see him again because,
    frankly, he left me with the creeps." abby, i spent two years in vietnam as a
    nurse attached to the 1st cavalry, and i would like to tell "no name" that she
    was undoubtedly dealing with a bona fide vet who had stepped on a vietnamese land
    mine, specifically designed to detonate in midair, catching its victims in the
    chest, hips, pelvis and thighs. i saw numerous young men come into our operating
    room with wounds beyond description from shrapnel. many had to be patched up in
    any way possible, which would account for the extensive use of plastic to hold
    this man''s body together. (transsexuals, by the way, do not need plastic parts.)
    and yes, his body would look "different," having been repaired by doctors and
    nurses whose first concern was trying to save his life--not how the results would
    look. i think "no name" has stumbled onto a rare find: a man who was probably
    embarrassed by the physical appearance of his body, but was willing to expose
    it honestly instead of hiding behind a wall of shame and fear, as many people
    are inclined to do. imagine how he must feel each time he makes love to a woman
    for the first time, wondering how she will react. might that not have had something
    to do with the quality of their initial physical encounter? this man needs compassion
    and understanding for the physical and mental torment he has suffered, not rejection
    from a woman who finds him "creepy," or questions his sexuality because he doesn''t
    conform to her standards of what a "real" man should look like. do you really
    think because he likes to cook, bake, etc., it makes him less masculine? wake
    up--this is the 1980s! i''m now a carpenter and a trucker, but i''m still a woman!
    either open your eyes and recognize what a fine man he is--or send his address
    to me. i''ll take him, no questions asked. all woman'

    his composure for 10 minutes before resorting to physical tactics to retrieve
    his car keys from that neighbor who judged him as too drunk to drive. answer me
    this: if this man was (as his neighbor described him) so drunk he could hardly
    walk, how could he have overpowered the guy to get his keys back? i''ve never
    committed a violent act in my life, but if some self- righteous busybody confiscated
    my car keys because he decided that i was too drunk to drive, i''d be tempted

    i am incensed over your reply to "likes to travel." she, her husband and her unmarried
    sister, "clara," took trips together, and always booked one hotel room with two
    double beds. the married couple slept in one bed and clara and her two dogs slept
    in the other. the couple thought the bill should be split in half--they paying
    half, and clara paying the other half. and you agreed with the couple! abby, if
    this trio went to a restaurant and all three ordered the same meal, should the
    single woman pay one-half of the check--or one-third? there were three people
    in that hotel room, so why shouldn''t the rent be split three ways? why do married
    people insist on being thought of as one "couple" instead of two individuals?
    it''s appalling that singles are treated like second-class citizens. single women
    don''t have the same opportunities in the work force, and are overlooked socially,
    too! a person living alone pays the same rent on an apartment as a couple would
    for two. utilities are the same, and so are car payments, etc., and i have to
    make it with one paycheck. i suspect the married couple likes the arrangement
    as it stands. they''re giving clara the message that she can''t possibly travel
    alone, so she can either go with them or stay home. tell clara to dump her sister
    and brother-in-law, and travel alone. there are many wonderful tours that cater
    to singles--young and old. all clara has to do is go to a travel agency and her
    eyes will be opened. please rethink your answer, abby. singles who travel with
    a couple should pay one-third, not one-half. on clara''s side'

    i don''t care what your survey showed, men do prefer blonds. i am a natural brunet,
    now 30 years old, attractive, with a very nice figure. i attended a large high
    school and sat on the sidelines while the blonds got all the prize dates. when
    i got out into the working world, i noticed that more heads turned when a blond
    walked by, so guess what i did? i went blond! it was a drastic change! i worked
    as a teller at a bank at that time and was very visible. i had been in that position
    for five years as a brunet, but i didn''t get nearly the attention. as a blond,
    i''ve been stopped on the street, in stores, at the movies, at church and in bars
    by men who wanted to make conversation with me. customers at work told me that
    they had never noticed me before. some of my family didn''t care for my blond
    hair, but almost everybody else did. well, my family and a few girlfriends talked
    me into going back to my natural color. i kept it that way for about three months,
    then i realized i was no longer very "special" looking, so last saturday i went
    back to being a blond. if you can''t beat ''em--join ''em! goldilocks in sarasota'

    during the holidays someone left a beautiful, big basket of fruit on my doorstep.
    i thought it a wonderful gesture, but after careful examination, i found there
    was not a card or any sort of identification on it anywhere. now, i''m not usually
    the fraidy-cat sort of person, but after thinking about it, and having checked
    with friends and co-workers (all to no avail), i became rather concerned. who
    would leave such a lovely basket with no card? any other time i would have no
    qualms about eating it, but because of the tylenol deaths and other such scares,
    there is no way i would eat it or give it to anyone else. it''s a shame. maybe
    i am being overly cautious, but then again, what if i''m not? to the person, or
    persons, who left it, please don''t ever do anything like that again. if there
    was nothing wrong with it, a lovely basket of fruit went to waste. and if there
    was something in it, well, god help you. by the way, there were three people home
    the day it was put on the doorstep. if anyone knocked or rang our bell, nobody
    heard it. only a few people at work even know where i live, and i checked with
    the neighbors to see if it could have been delivered to us by accident, and maybe
    their relatives were asking if they''d received it. nothing. it seems so strange
    that no one knows where it came from, who delivered it, and no one saw anyone
    leave it on the step. tell me, abby, am i being foolish? judith k., st. louis'

    this is not tragic or world-shaking, but i would like your opinion and possibly
    the opinion of your readers. i just discovered that my college-age daughter does
    not wear underwear (panties). i was shocked, and told her i thought it was indecent.
    she replied, "i don''t want panty lines." she is a hard-working student, works
    part-time in a department store and does not drink, smoke or use drugs. i am very

    what''s wrong with me? i''m engaged to a wonderful man and i should be the happiest

    i was born in west virginia and have lived here all my life. "buddy," my fiance,
    moved here seven years ago from oregon. he was offered a job in california. he
    says it''s an opportunity of a lifetime, so he took it, so that is where we''ll
    be living after we''re married. buddy has already relocated there, and i visited
    him for three weeks to see what it was like. i suppose most people would say california
    has more to offer than west virginia. not for me it hasn''t. i don''t care for
    the california climate, the people, the distances or their way of life. i guess
    it boils down to the fact that i don''t want to move to california, raise a family
    there, grow old there and die there. it breaks my heart to think of leaving my
    family, friends and the state that i love. i''m not a career-type woman. all i

    my dear young son is very sad tonight, and his older sister says that she has
    often felt the same way. why? because a well-intentioned schoolteacher appointed
    other classmates to be team "captains," and to choose up their teams. they chose
    their classmates--one by one--until none remained. abby, only a child who has
    felt the pain and humiliation of having been chosen last can understand the feeling.
    my husband and i both experienced this as children, and now we are going through
    it again watching our own children. it would save many children many scars if
    teachers would find another way to divide the classroom into two teams to compete
    in spelling bees, gymnastics or whatever. abby, please pass this along. if just
    one teacher will discontinue that practice, it will be worthwhile. the joy of
    being chosen first--or early--does not last nearly as long as the pain those children
    feel when they are the last to be chosen. hurting in ohio'

    recently while we were in munich, germany, we came upon a display of eight new

    noticed that every home was built with a bathroom about six feet from the front
    door! it was actually in the entrance hall, and not part of the family living
    area. there was a partition that one could lock. i asked the salesman why a bathroom
    was situated near the front door--and locked away from the main area of the home.
    he said this was law in bavaria. homeowners cannot deny anyone who wants to use

    week. it''s from feb. 8 until the 14. robert muller, former assistant secretary-general
    of the united nations, wrote this piece for international forgiveness week. decide
    to forgive decide to forgive for resentment is negative resentment is poisonous
    resentment diminishes and devours the self. be the first to forgive, to smile
    and to take the first step, and you will see happiness bloom on the face of your
    human brother or sister. be always the first do not wait for others to forgive
    for by forgiving you become the master of fate the fashioner of life the doer
    of miracles. to forgive is the highest most beautiful form of love. in return
    you will receive untold peace and happiness. here is the program for achieving
    a truly forgiving heart: sunday: forgive yourself. monday: forgive your family.
    tuesday: forgive your friends and associates. wednesday: forgive across economic
    lines within your own nation. thursday: forgive across cultural lines within your
    own nation. friday: forgive across political lines within your own nation. saturday:
    forgive other nations. only the brave know how to forgive. a coward never forgives.

  body: 'dear readers: hello, young lovers. and older lovers, too. some years ago,
    i wrote a column on how to keep your man happy. as soon as that hit print, i was
    asked to write another column on how to keep your woman happy. as a belated valentine
    to both men and women, here''s an updated version on how to keep each other happy:
    for women tell him often that you love him. (if you''re married, don''t ask him
    if he loves you, or he''s liable to say, "i married you, didn''t i?") never criticize
    him in public. if you do have a criticism, be sure it''s constructive and offered
    in the spirit of love and helpfulness, never in anger as a put-down. clip newspaper
    and magazine articles that might be helpful to him in his work. also pass along
    cartoons or an amusing article you think he''ll enjoy. sharing means caring. don''t
    bad-mouth his friends or, worse yet, his relatives. never keep him waiting. if
    he has a tendency to be late, when you''re meeting him somewhere, always have
    something in your purse to read. it makes the waiting more tolerable, and you''ll
    be less apt to chew him out when he finally shows up. don''t call him at work
    unless it''s absolutely necessary. every man needs a desk, a closet or a cupboard
    to call his own. don''t try to tidy it up for him even though it''s a cluttered
    mess and an eyesore. if he eats, or drinks, a little too much, don''t nag him
    about it. but do remind him in a loving way that you wish he''d take better care
    of himself because you''d like to have him around to grow old and gray with. never
    quiz him about where he''s been (or with whom) when you weren''t with him. don''t
    sulk. if something''s bugging you, talk it out and clear the air. never lie to
    him. if there''s something you prefer not to tell him, reserve the right to remain
    silent. but if you tell him something, be sure it''s the truth. keep yourself
    kissing clean from head to toe. develop some interests other than him. the more
    interests you have, the more interesting you''ll be. surprise him occasionally.
    a little love note left on his pillow, in his lunch pail or briefcase will warm
    his heart. for men tell her you love her. she can''t hear it too often. if you
    like the way she looks, dresses, talks, smells, let her know it. you can''t compliment
    a woman too much. never try to make her jealous. treat her with the same respect
    and courtesy you show women you don''t know as well. in addition to remembering
    her on all the usual gift-giving occasions --birthdays, anniversaries, christmas
    or hanukkah and st. valentine''s day --surprise her with a little gift for no
    reason at all. if you''ve had an especially wonderful evening, the next morning
    send her flowers or a single rose. if she''s a working woman, send it to her place
    of employment. she''ll appreciate it twice as much. if you use her car, bring
    it back washed, with a full tank. walk up behind her and plant a kiss on the back
    of her neck. cleanliness is next to godliness, so when you feel turned on, turn
    on the shower and jump in. when you''re at a party together, never leave her alone
    while you''re off dancing, or being charming, with someone else. (most women are
    not as resourceful and aggressive as men in social situations.) tell her she is
    absolutely the most wonderful person in the world, and she''ll believe that you
    are. if you want to be loved, be loving. be nice to her relatives and they''ll
    tell her how lucky she is to have you. to get abby''s booklet "how to write letters
    for all occasions," send a check or money order for $2.50 and a long, stamped

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    remember real men? they don''t eat quiche. they wear the labels of their designer
    jeans inside their clothing. they do not have "meaningful dialogues." that was
    three years ago. today, there is a brand new role model: the nice guy. he is smart,
    sensitive, funny and polite. he is also weary of the singles scene, serious about
    commitment and just the slightest bit lonely. he sleeps alone. bruce feirstein,
    33, is a self-proclaimed expert on real men and nice guys, having written the
    books on both: "real men don''t eat quiche," the 1983 paperback best-seller, and
    his recently published "nice guys sleep alone," subtitled "dating in the difficult
    eighties." "i think the pendulum is swinging back," the author said. "health reasons
    aside, there is a fundamental change in the country since i wrote "real men."
    do you think anybody today really wants to be warren beatty? do you think anybody
    wants to be 50 years old and unconnected? what''s so great about that? i think
    the vast majority of american males and females wants to settle down and build
    a life with someone." that''s a pretty serious insight coming from feirstein,
    a quick, funny former advertising success who talks about himself with the sort
    of breezy irreverence that talk-show hosts love. just your average guy of average
    height, with dark, frizzy curls and a boyish grin, feirstein is wearing a pin-striped
    shirt, a fair isle sweater, corduroy pants, a rolex watch and sneakers. he brings
    to mind tom hanks in his role as the nice guy who falls in love with a mermaid
    in "splash." there are no mermaids in feirstein''s past, but there are snide references
    in the book to a woman with whom the author had a tumultuous relationship. "she
    would call me up and say, ''i love you. i need you. let''s get married,'' and
    i''d say, ''great. when?'' and she would say, ''uh, not for the next two weeks.
    i have dates,'' " feirstein recalled with a wry smile. it was while recovering
    from this ill-fated romance that the author began comparing experiences with his
    single friends and realized that all seemed to have trouble dating. "it occurred
    to me that we were never supposed to date for two decades," he said. it also occurred
    to him that the subject would make a terrific humor book, a sort of quickie, comic
    read in the same genre as those about preppies, yuppies, dead cats and real men.
    the 148-page paperback is filled with charts, cartoons, parodies (about sam spade
    and sigmund freud) and chapters on everything from "the most depressing day in
    a single man''s life" to "the ultimately depressing top forty" ("the way we were,"
    "bridge over troubled waters" and "at seventeen," among others). paying the price
    "it''s not a how-to book, it''s not a self-help guide," feirstein said. "it''s
    more about compassion and compromise, but done in a satirical manner. what the
    book says is that there is a price you pay for everything. you go through all
    these relationships thinking, oh, there is time to grow up later. but anyone who
    reaches the age of 30 or 35 tends to suffer from a certain amount of battle fatigue."
    one of feirstein''s favorite observations about today''s rocky road to romance
    is "the waiter rule": "as you sit down to dinner together, observe carefully how
    your date treats the waiter. does he or she sneer, ''get me this, bring me that?''
    do they treat the waiter like a hand slave? then that''s exactly the way they''re
    going to be treating you in six months." he also lampoons singles ads ("stunning
    beauty" means "lots of makeup," "sensitive" means "five years of therapy") and
    dating styles (in "power dating," the doles--robert, the senator, and elizabeth
    hanford, the cabinet member--are the role models). feirstein readily concedes
    that he is more a muddled everyman than a dear abby when it comes to modern romance.
    "i''m average. i''m like anybody else," he said. "i''ve had some long- term relationships
    and some periods of going out with everyone in the world." he is also divorced,
    having been married briefly to his college sweetheart. --'

    i am a 34-year-old widow with two children. my husband died two weeks ago at the
    age of 37. already i have been assured that i am still young and attractive and
    i will have no trouble getting married again. someone even asked me why i am still
    wearing my wedding rings. (i am a widow, not a divorcee. don''t people know the
    difference?) i know people want to comfort me, but this kind of talk is not comforting.
    i know how young i am, but i don''t want to hear talk of getting married again.
    please tell people what to say and what not to say to a young widow. i had only
    12 years with a wonderful man and my heart is still aching. young widow'

    what do i do with a husband who refuses to help around the house? i have two kids
    under 4 years old. my husband works eight, nine or 10 hours a day, comes home,
    eats, takes a bath and goes to bed, and wonders why i''m not ready for bed. when
    i ask him to give me a hand with the housework or the kids, he tells me he works
    all day and the house and kids are my job. he thinks i nap during the day, watch
    tv and visit with the neighbors. having a new baby, i have all i can do (after
    being up half the night) to keep our clothes washed and pick up after him and
    the kids. i''ve turned into a tired, grouchy nag. i have no time for myself. he
    does work hard, long hours, but when he comes home, i''m still working. he won''t
    even take out the trash, mow the lawn or clean the garage. he''s good to me otherwise.
    he''s never hit me or chased other women, and he doesn''t drink or smoke. thanks.

    may i elaborate on your comment to "yea or nay?" who wanted to know about sending
    a sympathy card three months after a death. i''m glad you said "yea." abby, the
    cards received later are appreciated as much as those received in the first deluge
    of mail. sometimes, more. 1. send a card or a personal note. i have read and re-read
    those notes many times. this is an important part of the grieving process--to
    know that others cared. 2. don''t forget us at the holiday season. i was sadly
    amazed at the number of greeting cards i didn''t receive from friends i had always
    heard from. we widows and widowers need to get through the holiday time, and it''s
    very important to hear from loved ones. 3. i have just passed the first-year milestone
    of my dear husband''s death. i received many calls and personal notes to let me
    know they remembered, and missed him, too. in closing, if there''s doubt in your
    mind, write or get in touch. the fact that you care will far outweigh the moment
    of sadness that is there anyway. sign me . . . a recent widow'

    in reference to that charming poem you published titled "a kiss goodnight": as
    a dedicated record collector from way back, may i set the record straight? that
    poem supposedly authored by a 16-year-old girl is not original. it''s an obvious
    steal from the song titled, "i said my pajamas and put on my pray''rs," written
    by eddie pola and george wyle. it was popular in the late ''40s and early ''50s,
    and was recorded by margaret whiting and frank de vol. i have it on a 78 rpm capitol
    record. since record companies stopped making 78s long before that 16-year-old
    girl was born, it''s safe to assume that this ditty predates the young poet by
    several years. i trust that this will be the vinyl word on the subject. glen banks,

  body: 'dear readers: in 1982 the group for the advancement of psychiatry, of which
    i am an honorary lifetime consultant, invited me to join its committee on psychiatry
    and the community, whose current project was to study the problems of caring for
    a mentally ill family member at home. gap''s 200 members are among the nation''s
    most eminent psychiatrists, and i felt privileged to sit among them. eager to
    contribute, i ran the following in my column: "confidential to my readers: if
    a family member has been diagnosed as ''mentally ill'' and is living at home,
    please write and tell me what problems this has created for you. your first-hand
    experiences are needed for an important study." my readers didn''t let me down.
    i received hundreds of letters, relating in detail what family life is like with
    a chronically mentally ill person to care for at home. they described their weariness,
    anger, grief and shame, their sacrifices and round-the-clock responsibilities,
    the emotional strain and the financial drain of caring for a mentally ill child
    or adult. many said they felt frustrated and disappointed in their doctors, the
    government agencies, and the legal red tape encountered when asking for assistance.
    the message of these letters was loud and clear. the families of the chronically
    mentally ill cannot carry the burden alone. nor should they be expected to. many
    of their letters were 20 and 30 pages long--written, a few pages at a time, over
    a period of weeks. some were tear-stained. i read them all, then passed them along
    to the psychiatrists who answered each one in an effort to help these family members
    cope with their problems. these psychiatrists, who had been trained to remain
    emotionally detached from the problems of their patients, read the letters in
    stunned silence. some wept openly. their study took four years to complete. after
    reading the final report, i was so impressed with its content and clarity, that
    i suggested they offer it as a handbook to psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric
    social workers, as well as family members who must care for a chronically mentally
    ill child or adult at home. the members of the committee agreed, and a book was
    born. the title: "a family affair: helping families cope with mental illness."
    it is now in most bookstores, priced at $9.95. if your bookstore does not have
    it, it can be obtained by sending (check or money order) $10 plus $1 for postage
    and handling to: brunner/mazel publishers, 19 union square west, new york, n.y.
    10003. (new york residents must add the appropriate taxes.) the foreward of this
    book was written by shirley starr, a past president of the national alliance for
    the mentally ill. she said (in part): "this is a book about how family members
    deal with mentally ill relatives, and what they need in order to continue in their
    heroic tasks. the reports of their experiences, conveyed in the stark and honest
    language of alternating despair and courage, bridge the distance between the two
    groups of care-givers: families and professionals. "the visible effects of those
    letters on the committee members provided a rare moment of communion with me,
    and a better understanding of my experiences and those of other families. this
    book is an important contribution." and finally, dear readers, i am deeply indebted
    to those of you who took the time to tell your painful stories in order that others
    might learn from them. problems? write to abby. for a personal, unpublished reply,

    please say something to those ill-mannered people who have the disgusting habit
    of coughing without covering their mouths. the other night my husband and i attended
    a play for which we paid $37 a ticket, but we could not enjoy the play because
    this woman behind us coughed on our necks repeatedly. we got results (temporarily)
    after we turned around and glared at her. i recently quit a volunteer job that
    i really enjoyed--delivering meals on wheels. why? because the driver never covered
    his mouth when he coughed. my son complains that a girl who sits next to him at
    work does the same thing. how would you handle this situation? would you hand
    the person a tissue? or just courteously say, "would you please cover your mouth

    these days when most people are understandably suspicious of strangers, i must
    relate a recent experience. on friday, feb. 6, i went to the countryside theater
    in clearwater, fla., to see a matinee showing of the film "platoon." because i
    am a combat veteran of vietnam, for me that film was so realistic that i found
    myslef searching the screeen for the enemy and checking behind me only to discover
    a theater audience. when the movie ended i was so emotionally drained, i coudn''t
    leave my seat. something snapped, and i lost the control of nearly two decades
    and fell apart completely. i leaned my head on the seat in front of me and began
    to sob uncontrollably, crying for all the people who had been maimed and killed
    in that senseless war, crying for all the friends i had watched die. suddenly
    i felt someone''s arm around me, and a woman asked, "are you all right?" i was
    inarticulate, but managed to say that i had been there. then i looked up and saw
    that she was crying. although i was crying for others, she was crying for me.
    i was stunned! all i know about this stranger who conforted me in my moment of
    need is that she''s about 20 years old, very pretty, and the people who know this
    beautiful, compassionate lady are lucky indeed. paul maccaulay jr., palm harbor,

    while touring new zealand, i dated a 56-year- old man. on our first date (which
    was also our last) while dining at a restaurant, he reached over for what i thought
    was to be a friendly kiss --instead he stuck his fingers in my mouth, tugged at
    my teeth and laughingly asked, "are these false?" fortunately, i don''t have false
    teeth, but what odd behavior! then a pennsylvania man i had known intimately for
    15 years (and almost married) arranged to meet me in las vegas for a romantic
    weekend, after we had not seen each other for four years. upon retiring the first
    evening, he reached over as if to hug me, but instead he pulled at my teeth, making
    a joke (ha-ha) about false teeth. i was stunned! (what if i had had false teeth?)
    is this crass and rude behavior what we can look forward to should we lose our
    teeth? how can a lady handle this repulsive behavior without stooping to their

    were wrong. with the recent influx of foreign doctors, i''m sure all that woman
    wanted was a doctor she could communicate with. some have accents so thick, they
    can''t be understood, and other doctors don''t understand the questions they are
    asked. i don''t care what color a doctor''s skin is, but if i''m paying the doctor
    bills, i want one i can communicate with. one smiling doctor even jokingly said
    to me, "your 2-year-old speak more better english than me." this is no joke, abby.

    the other evening, donna, my 26-year-old daughter, asked me to baby-sit her two
    children. as donna and her husband were preparing to leave for the dinner party,
    donna remarked that she always loved an invitation to the smiths (made-up name)
    because they have a hot tub. i asked donna as they were walking out the door whether
    they had forgotten their bathing suits, since all her husband was carrying was
    a bottle of wine for the hosts. donna''s reply astounded me. she said nobody wears
    a bathing suit in a hot tub because it''s too darn hot. abby, am i old-fashioned
    and over the hill at 46? donna and her husband and the other couples apparently
    soak together naked! i asked donna how they could do this, and she replied that
    all the couples involved are "good" friends. abby, i have a number of very good
    and close friends, but not close enough to bathe together in our birthday suits.
    in fact, the only person i would ever share a hot tub with is my husband. what
    do you think of what my daughter and her husband and their friends are doing?
    is this as common as she makes it sound? am i the odd duck now? irene b. in albany'

    my husband and everyone he works with has to "ask" for their paycheck when it
    is due. when i asked him why he has to "ask," he said that he was told that a
    former employee had told management that he felt demeaned by having his check
    handed to him, so they adopted this policy as correct business etiquette. (they
    employ eight people.) my husband once jokingly told them that he didn''t mind
    being "offended," but their policy continues as usual. i have been in the business
    world for the last 30 years and have never heard of management anywhere employing

    in response to "looking heavenward," who asked you whether she would be reunited
    in marriage with her first love in heaven, or would she be stuck with her "worthless"
    husband: that question has been of concern for many centuries. according to the
    writings of matthew in the new testament, jesus was asked this question regarding
    a woman who had been married to each of seven brothers: "when the dead rise to
    life, whose wife will she be?" jesus answered that when the dead rise to life,
    they will be like angels in heaven, and will neither be married or given in marriage.

    please print this: an open letter to wedding guests: after eight months of planning,
    and several thousand dollars, my daughter''s wedding was beautiful. thank you
    all for coming. unfortunately, some of you will not receive a thank-you note for
    your lovely presents. the reason should be obvious: the practice of bringing a
    gift to the reception is becoming the norm rather than the exception. very late
    in the evening, after the newlyweds had departed, the caterer had been paid and
    the reception was over, the family was faced with loading hundreds of presents
    into the too few remaining cars. naturally, when the gifts were unloaded, some
    had cards attached, some did not. and don''t forget the loose cards found on the
    floor, on tables, etc. so, if you receive a note thanking you for the "lovely
    present," don''t blame my daughter for not specifically mentioning your gift.
    she has no idea who gave her that place setting of sterling silver. we have loose
    gift cards, and we have gifts with no cards. how can she possibly thank each of
    you? incidentally, the guests who (properly) sent their presents to our home before
    the wedding received a thank-you note by return mail! mother of the bride'

    the divorce), but after they were paid, he''d see what he could do. shortly after
    this conversation, he married his girlfriend --30 years his junior--and they started
    a new family. once again i approached him. he said his new family (one child)
    was expensive, and besides, what did i need college for? his young wife never
    went to college. i could not believe a so-called educated man uttered those words.

    attractive little boy of 3, took the pillow and kept throwing it up in the air
    and catching it (sometimes) during the entire service. he was seated between his
    parents and neither one attempted to discipline him. frequently, during the procession,
    the kids do not make it up the aisle, but wander instead to an aunt or uncle on
    the way there, and cannot be prodded to go where they went during rehearsal. kids
    crying in the church (or synagogue, or whatever) are an invasion to the sacred
    ceremony, and well do i remember the words of a minister, "a baby who cries in
    church is like a new year''s resolution--it ought to be carried out." a bolder
    colleague once said, while a baby persisted in crying during the service: "will

    your readers clarified the practice of introducing children as "step" or adopted,
    etc. my question concerns a twist of this idea. my parents divorced, and both
    remarried after i left home. how should i introduce their respective spouses?
    i would be comfortable with the "step" term, but my mother-in-law says it would
    be inappropriate. how about couples who are just living together? whachacallit,

    i just hate it when someone walks up to me and says, "do you know who you look

    my husband of 25 years is an excellent provider, a non-smoker and non-drinker,
    he doesn''t chase other women, and he''s an elder in our church. but he allowed
    our son, "dickie"--an only child--to quit school at 15 and get married at 16.
    we supported dickie, his wife and child for five years. (we even gave his wife
    $1,000 for flying lessons.) they separated, so now dickie and his son are living
    with us. no sooner did they move in, when five of dickie''s friends (two girls
    and three boys) moved in on us! one of the girls has a 13-month-old child, is
    unmarried, and she''s pregnant again by the same guy. i am not only raising our
    grandchild, but i have these five bums here all day long. they sleep till noon,
    play loud music all day and nobody works. they won''t even pick up after themselves.
    after three weeks, i told my husband i wanted those hoodlums out of our house.
    he put them up in a motel, but they were kicked out before the week was over for
    disturbing the peace. now my husband has let them move into our beautiful home
    on the lake where all of our silver and fine furniture are stored! they have broken
    our crystal, burned holes in the couch and set wet glasses on our good wood furniture.
    and now i find they are stealing! i am ready to divorce my husband over this!
    he has paid lawyer fees, fines and bail money for these bums. what should i do?
    don''t tell me to talk to our pastor. he tells everything he knows. heartsick'

    i''ve been having an affair with the husband of a friend of mine. it''s been going
    on for over two years. we get together about three times a month. there are times
    when i feel guilty, but not very often. we meet in the daytime at a motel--nothing
    fancy. we spend about three hours together (in bed). we can''t go out in public
    because everybody knows him. he rarely calls because he''s busy with business.
    he only calls to ask me to meet him. he has never said he loves me--only that
    he "needs" me. when i tell him i love him, he keeps telling me how much he "needs"
    me. (what is that supposed to mean?) he has never bought me a gift, and he has
    plenty of money. i''m not a gold digger, but a little gift would be nice to show
    he''s thinking of me. i wanted to buy him a birthday present and he told me not
    to because his wife would wonder where it came from. abby, can you figure this

    my husband (i''ll call him denny) is a police officer, and our neighbors know
    it. last week a neighbor called denny while he was home--off duty--and asked him
    to meet him about a mile from our house. we thought this neighbor was having car
    trouble. when denny got there, he found some guy holding a woman hostage with
    a gun! not only was valuable time lost until the police arrived, but denny was
    totally unprepared for the situation and could have been killed. another time,
    a neighbor lady called denny and asked him to come over and arrest some guy because
    he had cashed her paycheck without her permission! abby, why do people think that
    because off-duty police officers are armed they are always available? (cops carry
    their weapons to protect themselves from criminals who might recognize them as
    cops and try to "waste" them.) police officers are taught in the academy that
    if they see a crime committed, they should try to be a good witness, but leave
    the law enforcing to the cops in that jurisdiction. (most cops don''t appreciate
    outsiders butting in.) the bottom line is this: if a cop is needed, don''t waste
    time calling one who is home off duty. call the station. i hope you think this
    is important enough for your column. denny''s wife'

    their son constantly, while completely ignoring their daughter. about 10 minutes
    into the mass the mother took the little girl''s glasses off of her and said:
    "you look ugly with those glasses; i''ll hold them. do the best you can without

    tried to button her own coat, and she couldn''t even find the buttons. they bundled

    my friends and relatives do not know my taste very well and tend to give things

    my husband and i disagree strongly. his work takes him out of town periodically
    on business seminars. the last two trips, he has developed a friendship with a
    woman from his office who also attends these three-day seminars. the first time,
    he took her out for a drink and dancing. the second time, they had breakfast together
    every morning--just the two of them--even though there were seven people from
    the same office there. they spent every evening together--with him walking her
    to her room (one night getting in at 3:30 a.m.). this friendship is still going
    on at work; they go to lunch together, taking time off in the middle of the day
    to go shopping. he claims it''s business and there is no reason for me to be upset.
    the lady says it is jst a platonic friendship--she has many male friends and her
    husband doesn''t mind. am i wrong to let this friendship upset me? or is my husband
    wrong to expect me to accept this kind of friendship? hurt in oregon'

    my husband''s 24-year-old son, "clyde," does not live with us --he lives with
    a young woman. clyde asked if they could spend the night at our home after attending
    a reception in our area. at bedtime, i offered the young lady our guest bedroom,
    clyde was assigned our 14-year-old son''s bedroom, and our son was given a sleeping
    bag. clyde and the lady went upstairs to get ready for bed. shortly thereafter,
    my husband and i retired. at 3 a.m. the lights were still burning in our son''s
    bedroom, which remained unoccupied. (they obviously disregarded our wishes that
    they occupy separate rooms.) the following morning at breakfast, our 14-year-old
    son was aware that this unmarried couple had slept together and made the comment
    that maybe now he would become an "uncle"! if my stepson can come into our home
    and share a bed with his girlfriend, what would prevent our son from assuming
    that it would be ok for him to do during his courting time? neither my husband
    nor i said anything to clyde the next morning, but we were certainly upset about

    and i were working on our class floats. the night before the parade always finds
    classes working right through the night. jim and i had scooted home to steal a
    few hours of sleep before getting back for the parade. glad to have a few moments
    to ourselves after so many hectic days, we were soon enjoying ourselves completely.
    in the middle of all this intimacy, my husband pipes up and asks, "what size chicken
    wire does your class use for tissue stuffing on your floats?" needless to say,
    the mood changed instantly--but not to one of silence as "hurt" related in her
    letter. we both broke into a wholehearted laugh! am i to assume that jim loves
    me any less because his mind was elsewhere? not on your life! this incident is
    among our funniest memories. by the way, we''ve been married for 19 years. ours
    was a marriage that everyone said would never last because we were so young (i

    our mother, at age 79--after having been a lonely widow for 10 years--fell in
    love with her south american dancing instructor. against the advice of her family
    and friends she married this smooth operator, who flattered her and made her feel
    "young, beautiful and desirable" (according to her). mother was 80 and he was
    39 at the time. she died four months ago at the age of 85, leaving her three children
    a mere token. her seven grandchildren were left a token as well. everything else
    went to her husband of five years. of course we are contesting the will because
    of mother''s bizarre behavior these last six years. also, we feel that this young
    opportunist took unfair advantage of a lonely, rich, gullible old woman. abby,
    when a will is contested, who usually wins? b.j. and f.'

    i run a 50-room motel in the south. when a guest checks in, i always ask, "how
    many in your party?" almost all of them say, "just me." that would be fine if
    they would stop right there, but most of them will remark, "for now," or "why,
    do you know someone?" i ask the question only because i charge $3 for an extra
    person. how can i phrase the question without getting a smart-mouthed follow-up

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i see short skirts are coming back. this should make my husband happy. the first
    time he met me, i was wearing a skirt so short that if i had reached for something
    on a closet shelf it would have constituted a crime in some states. my hair was
    almost as long as my dress. in the years since, the trend toward shorter hair
    and longer skirts has often filled him with a deep sadness. he believes that women
    shold show lots of leg and no ear. i am of two minds. i love short skirts, although
    i have always had the traditional irish girl piano legs, suitable for field hockey
    but not for display. but i feel as if i''m a little too something now to show
    my legs: too grown-up, too married and motherly, too old. i wish this was about
    what i wear, but in truth it is about who i am, or at least who i want to appear
    to be. a friend of mine found herself adrift recently in a department store, wandering
    amid the racks in some distress. finally she had the money, but she didn''t have
    the self-image down. a simple shopping trip had turned existential. for years
    she had been one kind of woman, but now she had become another. who was this person
    she was attempting to outfit? and was that person a good candidate for knits?
    i know just how she felt. each month the catalogues come, and i pick out things:
    clothes i would have worn 10 years ago, clothes i think i should want to wear
    now, clothes for the collected person that i''ve always wanted to be. (i am waiting
    for the catalogue for the person i fear i have become. chaos, it would be called.
    "for the woman who can never find anything clean in her bureau drawers.") my closet
    has a dozen personas lurking inside: shoulder pads, little prints, pleated pants,
    pleated skirts, fuschia, black, navy blue. the worst part about cleaning it is
    chucking unsuccessful past lives: the carefree peasant, the funky girl-about-town,
    the dress-for-success suits that for one brief, horrible period of insecurity
    and ambition i affected. you cannot give those suits away. you must drive a silver
    stake through their lapels. i was a girl who spent 10 of the best years of her
    life wearing a forest- green blazer with a school insignia on the breast pocket,
    a plaid pleated skirt and saddle shoes, so i suppose i shouldn''t complain. better
    this than my mother''s closet, filled with her own little uniforms: the nice suit
    with the shell blouse and matching pumps and purse for card parties, the pastel
    shirtwaist dress with peter pan collar and pleated front for dinner, the madras
    bermudas and blouse for the back yard. the role defined the clothes. betty friedan
    wrote in "the feminine mystique" that the question for those times was "is this
    all?" now, of course, we feel differently. i hope this is all because i can''t
    handle any more: so many roles, so many clothes. i know there are people who will
    contend that how you look has nothing to do with who you are. there has been a
    recent exchange of letters about this in dear abby. a young woman who wears nothing
    but garments made of black leather wrote to complain that men got the wrong idea
    from her personal style. to this abby replied, in essence, and i''m with her all
    the way on this one: "get real." clothes are some kind of a mirror of what''s
    inside; otherwise, why would maternity dresses be designed to make you look like
    a baby? a mohawk is a statement about how you perceive the universe. but young
    people make these kinds of mistakes unthinkingly. at a dinner several years ago
    i ran into a politician i have known for years. i was wearing my black dinner
    suit, and so was he, and he began to reminisce to a group of people about the
    first time we had met. it was at a press conference at city hall--my first press
    conference, my first visit to city hall. i was so eager, he said, i appeared to
    be on drugs. i was so intimidated, he said, that i introduced myself twice to
    a minor functionary and then stuck to him like glue. and i was wearing hot pants,
    he said. have you ever seen a decade of credibility crumble before your very eyes?
    not pretty. now, of course, hot pants have returned to their former status as
    a condition rather than a garment, and i have developed a bit more sense. but
    still i feel that i have not got the self-image down, what one of my friends calls
    "the look." now that i have passed from college to first job to marriage to other
    jobs to kids, i should have some sense of what to take off the rack. it''s not
    that i should know how to dress; i should know whom i''m dressing. but when i
    group my clothing according to the traits conveyed, my closet looks like a convention
    of multiple personality cases. so i contemplate short skirts. they were once me,
    although that was a time in my life when my character was so ambiguous it could
    have qualified as protoplasm. but are they me now? and which me are they? and
    is that the me i want other people to see? i wish buying clothes was about clothes.
    i hate character analysis in front of a three-way mirror, especially when i am
    looking at the back reflection. i hold up a skirt on a hanger and imagine it 10
    years from now, a sociological find, a conversation piece: remember when they
    tried to bring short skirts back, and you were dumb enough to buy one? was that
    really you who did that?'

    several years ago, my son left ohio to take an executive position in denver. while

    and happiness in their new life together. i never did receive a thank-you note,
    but at the time i wrote it off as simply an oversight. sue recently had a baby.
    i splurged on clothes for the new arrival. (you know how grandmothers can be.)
    it''s been four months and i have not received an acknowledgment from sue. finally
    i mentioned to sue that i was waiting for an acknowledgment from her. her reply,
    "i have a perfect card for you; i just haven''t had the time to send it." abby,

    after 42 years of marriage, my parents divorced when my mother learned that my
    father had purchased a penthouse condominium for "cynthia," his mistress of many
    years. apart from the pain and humiliation this caused mom, it created a split
    among the siblings. my younger sister and i sided with our mother. our brother
    and older sister sided with dad. when our parents separated, dad moved into the
    condo with cynthia. a few months later dad''s mother died, and he brazenly brought
    cynthia to the funeral. our whole family was there, and it was very painful for
    mother to see dad and his mistress together in public. (my parents were still
    legally married.) three months later, my older sister''s son had his bar mitzvah.
    dad''s invitation was addressed to him alone, but he accepted on the condition
    that he could bring cynthia. my sister agreed. when mom heard this, she refused
    to attend, which angered my sister so much she hasn''t spoken to our mother since
    --it''s been 18 months. by the way, mom sent a lovely bar-mitzvah gift, which
    was never acknowledged. abby, i feel as though i''ve lost half my family. i am

    will you please use the power of your column to stop people from giving condoms
    to young people on campuses, at youth groups, and wherever young people gather?
    i am appealing to you as a parent who has tried to raise her children with high
    christian morals--to say no to sex--and now we have these liberal do-gooders handing
    out condoms to "protect" our children against pregnancy, vd and aids. society
    might just as well say, "go out and have a good time, and take these with you

    i recently attended a choral concert with my boyfriend. during the first number,
    a woman seated behind me sang loudly and hummed along. at first, i just gave her
    a stern look, hoping she would stop, but when she didn''t, i "shushed" her. she
    kept right on singing, then at the end of the piece, her husband leaned forward
    and said, "madam, because of your rudeness, you not only ruined the piece for
    my wife, but for me as well!" abby, was i wrong to ask her to stop singing along?
    in my mind, if his wife can''t tell the difference between a concert and a sing-along,

    another view about not receiving thank-you notes for gifts of checks: our family
    has always felt that a gift of cash is no gift at all. we would prefer to receive
    a card by itself if it contains a heartfelt sentiment. obviously the giver of
    cash does not feel the need to take the time to select an appropriate gift, so
    why give a "gift" at all? how much time does it take to select a pretty necklace
    or hair combs for a teenage girl? it''s easy to ask a salesperson for help to
    see what''s in style. can''t get out to shop? why not send a subscription to a
    magazine? or order from a mail-order catalog? we feel that cash is a poor substitute
    for caring. no cash, please. draw me a picture or write me a poem. scharre johnson,

    a very sick woman--and could i please help her. the poor woman was shaking, so
    i suggested we call a family member as i had never seen this lady before in my

    she was 69, but she looked much older. she started shaking badly, and began looking
    for her bottle. (she had bottles hidden all over the place, but the ones i found
    were empty!) we visited for half an hour, then she fell asleep on the couch, so
    i called the apartment manager who turned out to be a young lady about 35. she
    said, "leave her alone; don''t get involved. go on home." i went home, but, abby,
    this poor lady has called me five times asking me to come back. part of me says,

    of money at the concession stand, would i give her a couple of dollars so she

    was asked to stand and give a 50-second verbal resume of what he or she had done
    in the last 50 years. that was pretty tough for me because i never could talk
    in front of a lot of people. i started out ok, telling about how i married my
    childhood sweetheart right after graduation, went to live on a farm (which i loved),
    and even after my husband''s heart attack less than a year ago, he was now working
    hard as ever. i said we were building a golf course that i hoped we could finish--if
    i didn''t kill him first! everyone laughed. i sat down real fast when i realized
    what i had said. i was devastated all evening and ever since, because i had meant
    to say "if he didn''t kill himself first" (from all that hard work). i can''t
    forget that terrible blunder and i''m wondering what my classmates must have thought
    of me. the next day, i tried to tell a few people what i really meant, but i just
    couldn''t. abby, how would you have handled it? devastated in minnesota'

    frustrated than before. i feel guilty when i see albert and go home to my husband,
    and there''s a terrible letdown when i can''t get in touch with albert. so, my
    advice is to forget affairs. everyone gets burned. i''m lucky i can still save
    my marriage. i''m trying counseling. any suggestions? sorry i had an affair'

    i kicked him out and filed for divorce so he''s no longer with us, but i have
    a question for you: my soon-to-be ex-husband is in the u.s. army, stationed in
    washington state. his first sergeant signed him out of jail and under his custody.
    this first sergeant came to my apartment and told me that i would have to give
    my wedding rings back to my ex-husband because he still owes on them. i was told
    this was the law in washington state. i gave the rings to the first sergeant,

    thank them and pay them a little extra. it seems to me that these jobs are an

    being a registered pharmacist, i was thrilled to read the first person interview
    with pharmacist bud graber (march 29). however, i could not agree with one statement
    of his, that pharmacists in mass-marketing chains have never been able to counsel
    their clients. this blanket statement simply is not true. i worked for one of
    the largest chains in this country, filling sometimes 150 prescriptions a day--working
    alone--and not once did a client leave my counter without my personal contact
    and counseling. i, too, can--and have--"dispensed a lot of information while wrapping
    the purchase and making change." he should not have allowed his dislike for his
    competition to affect his thinking, and he should be ashamed of his put-down of
    members of his own profession. --janice l. gersh, r.ph., morton grove. not amused
    this is about the three letters in the dear abby column of april 19. the first
    was "helpless in pittsburgh" (who asked what she could do to help a 4-year-old
    girl she had observed in church being cruelly treated by her parents; among other
    things, the mother took the girl''s eyeglasses away, telling her, "you look ugly
    in them"). initially i thought of it as nonfiction and i was wrapped up in the
    plight of the little girl, until one line made me suspicious. it is out of character
    for a 4-year-old girl to make an immediate switch from pleading with her mother
    to give back her glasses to saying, "daddy, please let me go to live with grandma."
    this kind of issue- switching is typically adult. a 4-year-old would be single-purposed
    about getting her glasses back. either a transitional link between glasses and
    grandma was left out in the letter, or the writer is a liar. unless, of course,
    the letter itself is a myth written as fiction imitating life. assuming it''s
    a real letter, i''d check out the identity of "helpless in pittsburgh" to see
    if the writer was sincere or had some ax to grind. as for "not amused" (a woman
    who complained about a practical joker), neither was i. again, it smacks of being
    a sham. one line, "one of his favorite jokes is to drop a lighted cigarette into
    the hip pocket of his victim''s pants," indicates this was done on more than one
    occasion. whether at work or elsewhere, anyone doing this would be arrested, sued,
    fired and/or physically attacked--actions that would cause the jokester to stop--and
    onlookers, other than inmates of an asylum, would not laugh. but the letter from
    "concerned father" (who thought that when a friend of his 20-year-old daughter
    drops in unexpectedly during dinnertime, the friend should be made to wait in
    the den, alone, until the meal is over, thereby angering his daughter) is my main
    concern and the reason i decided to write. i think the reply given (that father
    was right in doing so, and daughter wrong in wanting her drop-in friend to be
    invited to dinner) is ridiculous. the letter indicates that the father considers
    his daughter''s friends to be somewhat less than real people. if his goal is to
    spend time alone with his captive family, he will succeed by treating his children''s
    friends as intruders. i have no doubt that his 20-year-old daughter will be apartment-
    hunting within the week. and he will be rid of his two teenagers as soon as they,
    too, become old enough to be off on their own. then he and his wife can have quiet
    dinners alone and live happily ever after until they become old and ill and need
    to move in with one of the children. then the "kids" will probably treat father
    and his friends like unwelcome intruders in their lives. if father''s goal is
    to develop a close relationship with his children, he should treat their friends
    the same way he would treat his own friends if they picked a less-than-ideal time
    to drop in: either invite them to join the family for dinner, or explain as tactfully
    as possible that the family is in the midst of a rather private conversation and
    it would be appreciated if they would come back a little later. if "concerned
    father" is a real person, the advice given by "abby" will, if taken, make him
    a very lonely old man. enforced togetherness is only effective in prisons and
    concentration camps. love, respect and mutually supportive friendship all have
    to be earned--even by parents. my children''s friends were always welcome in my
    home. sometimes the fresh point of view brought to dinner-table conversation by
    someone outside the family circle made life a little more interesting. always
    the closeness of our family was enhanced by assuring each member of being wanted,
    welcomed and loved enough to have their individual world overlap the private world
    of the family. --pamala hall dorgan, oak lawn. emotional insights doesn''t sunday
    have better material to fill its pages than the tired sexist shibboleths of psychotherapist
    nancy good (fast track, april 5) ? "emotionally, women are far more insightful
    than men. and men do not seek to improve relationships." this is psychotherapy?
    it sounds more like psychotic politics to me. she also says, "the social role
    for women is to be sweet, agreeable, polite, thoughtful and considerate. when
    she''s not, we have a name for her." what name? the only one i can find after
    reading that statement is that of its author. --john tomme, chicago.'

    was in danger of being marred? if this so-called man of god feels that crying

    picture this: you go into the china section of a fine department store where brides
    register their china, crystal and flatware patterns. after painstakingly selecting
    your gift, you instruct the salesperson to have it gift-wrapped and delivered
    to the bride-to-be (a service provided by the store). after you have paid for
    the gift and left the china department, your gift is returned to the stockroom,
    and a card is mailed to the bride advising her that you have purchased a gift
    for her, and listing the amount of money you spent on the gift. then, she may
    come to the store to get the cash, or use it to buy whatever she desires. this
    has happened frequently in the store where i have been employed for four months.
    in each case, the bride-to-be, when registering, requested no gifts--only cards
    with money amounts. she also asked the salesperson to keep her request confidential.
    i feel uncomfortable and deceitful going through the pretense of assisting a customer
    in selecting a wedding gift when i know in advance that the gift will not be sent.

    torn over whether she should allow "john," her grieving homosexual son whose lover
    of 10 years had just died of aids, to return home for a family reunion and come
    out of the closet to his entire family. john had told his mother that he was not
    about to sit down with his family and pretend that life is "beautiful" after having
    been through the most painful and tragic year of his life--and unless he could
    be open and honest with his family, he refused to come home. his mother said,
    "we love our son, but don''t want the embarrassment and hysteria that this situation
    could bring." i told the mother that the decision should be john''s, but for him
    to insist that the entire family be informed that he is gay, though it might cause
    embarrassment and hysteria, would be insensitive and inconsiderate, but to welcome
    him anyway. did i get letters! some excerpts: "... your response to the mother
    of john, whose lover and partner had just died of aids, was both incredibly insensitive
    and ignorant. you (and john''s mother) have conveniently overlooked two facts:
    (1) john is almost certain to die of aids as well; how are they going to deal
    with the ''hysteria and embarrassment'' of that situation? (2) if he''s been living
    with a male lover for 10 years, the relatives all know he''s gay anyway--they
    just don''t discuss it with his parents. "you missed an opportunity to do some
    educating about aids, homophobia and common decency." gary in houston "... i still
    have a column of yours in which you say: ''one thing is certain, god made gays
    just as surely as he made straights. and all his children are entitled to live
    and love in dignity, without shame or guilt.'' i can''t believe anyone who would
    make that statement would advise a gay person to stay in the closet at a time
    when he needs all the support and understanding he can get. if his family can''t
    stand the ''embarrassment and hysteria,'' that''s their problem, not his." bi
    in chicago "... many doctors have concluded that self-esteem plays a crucial role
    in the condition of the immune system. if john is forced to suppress who he is
    because his family finds it embarrassing, it could very well push his immune system
    over the edge. and what will his parents do if he does develop aids? tell him
    to pretend he has an extended case of the flu? abby, this is the time when john
    needs his family the most. shame on you for encouraging them to stifle him." kristie
    in mill valley "... the man is in pain. to ask him to be dishonest about a loving
    relationship is asking him, once again, to subordinate his feelings to those of
    heterosexuals at a time when he needs to be honest. his parents need to face their
    own ''shame'' concerning their son''s sexuality. (''we''ve never wanted to let
    the rest of the family know that john is gay.'') "you blew it, abby." mike v.

    can a recently divorced woman maintain a relationship with her musician ex-husband,
    even though she''s still stuck on him? sounds like a question for dear abby. in
    thursday''s episode of "the days and nights of molly dodd" (8:30 p.m. on nbc-ch.
    5.), molly (blair brown) admits she can''t get fred (william converse-roberts)
    out of her mind, so she goes to his apartment to help him write music for a client.
    of course, fred hasn''t changed his ways. he lends a friend money from the music
    grant and then needs to borrow money from molly. to complicate matters, molly''s
    mom, florence (allyn ann mclerie) checks out of the hospital and disappears. caption:

    thanks for your advice to "indiana mother" who objected to giving condoms to teenagers.
    you were right to remind her that sex with the wrong partner just once could be
    a death sentence--and better safe than sorry. but more important, what kind of
    moral values have these children been taught at home if they can be ignored just
    because someone hands them a free condom? does "indiana mother" think that her
    children are so ignorant they didn''t know that condoms existed, and could be
    bought at the local drug or grocery store? or does she think that one free condom
    will cause them to rush out and find a sex partner? teaching teenagers to say
    "no" to sex is like teaching them to say "no" to food. it''ll work until they

    it doesn''t matter if you''re 8 years old or 60, if you''re lucky enough to have
    a father, sit down and write him a letter. it doesn''t have to be a literary masterpiece;
    just a few sentences telling him how much he means to you, and why, will do. of
    course, if you are in a chatty or sentimental mood, go ahead and express the thoughts
    you may have found difficult to verbalize. and when you sign it, be sure to add
    the date. long after the neckties, shirts, sweaters and wallets are worn and discarded,
    i''ll bet your father''s day letter will remain--tucked away for safekeeping with

    my sister and i are both married. we decided to take a weekend trip together--just
    the two of us. just as our plans were coming together, she comes up with a "proposition"--if
    i lose 10 pounds before we leave, she will buy me a new outfit while we''re out
    of town. mind you, i am 5 foot 6 and weigh 125 pounds. i am by no means "fat,"
    but she would like to make me think i am. she''s always telling me that if there
    is something i want, she''ll give it to me if i "tone up" or lose weight. i am
    tired of her finding fault with me when she is just one size smaller than i am.
    is there some way i can tell her how i feel without hurting her feelings, although
    she has hurt mine more than once? up to here in charlotte, n.c.'

    recently you ran a letter in your column from a woman who wanted suggestions as
    to what to do about her husband''s scratchy beard, short of shaving it off, which
    he refused to do. our residents here at the good samaritan village in albuquerque,
    n.m., enjoy having "dear abby" read to them, and they had a very lively discussion
    about that letter. one of the residents suggested that the woman give her husband
    a permanent, which would curl the ends under and make the beard less scratchy.
    what do you think of the idea? mary a. johnson, activities coordinator'

    the man i''m dating is a widower, mid-60s, who was married for 40 years. i''m
    56. the problem is his table manners. he doesn''t have any. he doesn''t remove
    his hat in a restaurant, tucks his napkin into his collar under his chin and eats
    with both elbows on the table. when he eats steak, he holds his fork tightly in
    his fist with the handle vertical and cuts up all his meat at once. he eats so
    fast, he''s finished before i''m halfway through. he carries toothpicks in his
    wallet and thinks nothing of picking his teeth at the table. on the plus side,
    he''s generous, good-natured and fun to be with. he wants to marry me. i am wondering
    if he is hopeless. should i try to change him now? if so, how do i go about doing
    it? apparently his gross table manners never bothered his wife, but they sure
    do bother me. needs advice'

    i graduated from graceland college at lamoni, iowa, in 1930. twelve of us were
    very good friends. we all went in different directions after graduation, but wanted
    to keep in touch with each other, so we started a round-robin letter, and after
    57 years it is still making its rounds with only six of us left! that letter has
    had an interesting history. it was censored during the war, dunked in the ocean,

    she realized that in 40 years, he had placed only three ears of corn in the trunk.

    your reply to "denver dilemma" was somewhat shortsighted and narrow. i agree,
    to marry because you want to be a mother is a poor reason for marriage, but marriage
    is not required to become a mother--as many foolish teens have discovered to their
    chagrin. you offer to "denver" the options of single adoptive parenthood or finding
    a marriageable man, but why be so restrictive? i am a 32-year-old professional
    woman who is also aware that my biological clock is running out, and i have a
    dear male friend who has agreed to be a sperm donor for me if, by age 35, i haven''t
    met someone i want to marry. if "denver" can be a single adoptive parent, she
    can just as well be a single natural parent, without going through the adoption
    process, or "scrounging around" for a marriageable man. having a partner to raise
    children with is ideal--but it''s not the only way. biding my time'

    my problem is so personal that i have not been able to tell anyone about it. i
    am a 29-year-old unmarried man in the military. while growing up, my mother seldom
    spanked me--even when i deserved it. the children i grew up with received more
    spankings than i did--and i always thought i should have been spanked more than
    i was. now that i''m a grown man, this desire to be spanked is still on my mind.
    on one occasion, i thought of asking a young woman i was dating to spank me, but
    i didn''t have the nerve. i''ve heard that there are places where a guy can go
    to get a spanking, but i can''t find any where i''m stationed. part of me says
    that although i would not enjoy the pain, i would feel a lot better if i were
    on the receiving end of a good spanking. another part of me says the whole thing
    is off the wall, and i should forget it. abby, are there other men who want to
    be spanked by women? and what do you recommend for this problem? wants to be spanked'

    i am writing in regard to "lonesome," the man who can''t seem to meet any nice
    ladies despite his "polite" approach. may i give him some advice? 1. when you
    see a lady you want to meet, first try to establish eye contact. if she smiles,
    approach her; if she turns her head or acts as though she doesn''t want to know
    you look for someone friendlier. 2. don''t look for women in bars. go to the supermarket
    or attend a college night class in sewing, dancing or women''s studies. 3. if
    the lady seems interested enough to talk to you, don''t dominate the conversation
    with babble. let her talk. you will learn a lot about her. 4. upon parting, if
    she hints that she would like to see you again, ask her for a date. (take her
    phone number and give her yours.) women hate touchy- feely stuff, so don''t try
    it on the first date unless you enjoy being lonely. abby, if men could learn to
    read the outward signs women give them, there would be fewer lonely men. a man
    has to be very dumb not to know when a woman is interested--and when she''s not.
    my father taught me the above rules and i have never been without a date, and

    day to ensure his safety! officials had tried to place this convicted rapist-

    the medical school to which we had planned to leave her remains rejected her,

    memorial service. at the wake, knowing that after the casket was closed, i would
    not see her again until i joined her in eternity, i poured out my heart to her
    as she lay on display. i guess i shed a few tears as i said goodbye and planted
    a farewell kiss on her cold and silent lips. the clergyman (i am a former clergyman)
    scheduled to preach her memorial service became highly incensed because of even
    having the viewing in the first place, talking to my wife while she lay in the
    casket and kissing her. (her mother did the same thing.) he doesn''t believe in
    the traditional american way of death and honoring the remains, but only in "commencements"
    as he calls them--when the body is not in view. after the viewing, he telephoned
    me and "laid me out in lavender" using a few choice phrases, suggesting i was
    a mental case and in need of a psychiatrist. (one hundred and eight people attended
    the wake, and no one else objected.) abby, is it very unusual and totally out

    yes, i know that god is everywhere, but there are times when one feels the need
    to sit and be calm and comforted in a place devoted to his love. thanks, and love.

    i am a minister who prefers to call on my parishioners with no prior notice. my
    reason: if calls are made ahead of time, the women feel they have to have a little
    something to serve with coffee or tea, so they go to the trouble of baking something.
    naturally when the goodies are served, the minister feels obligated to eat them.
    not that it''s difficult--those homemade cakes, pies and cookies are usually very
    tasty. but after making three or four stops in one afternoon, can you imagine
    what the minister will look like in a few years? 25 pounds overweight'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    ten months ago my husband and i allowed our housekeeper''s boyfriend (i''ll call
    him steve) to stay in our guesthouse rent-free while he was temporarily unemployed.
    he stayed for three months, two unemployed and one catching up on his bills. at
    the beginning of the fourth month, we suggested that since he was working, he
    should pay rent. he thought we were asking too much, so he moved into a room about
    15 miles from our house. the problem is that now steve comes over to "visit" our
    housekeeper (i''ll call her donna) at least five nights a week. he has a key to
    our house, so he comes here right after work, lets himself in, showers in donna''s
    bathroom, stays for dinner with her, stays overnight in her room and then has
    breakfast in our kitchen before he leaves for work in the morning. i think steve
    is taking advantage of our hospitality. my husband says i should keep my mouth
    shut because if i say anything, donna might quit, and housekeepers as good as
    donna are hard to find. how can i discreetly tell donna that steve is welcome
    in our home, but not five nights a week, including meals? farbrent in brentwood'

    my wardrobe consists of nothing but slacks. i feel self-conscious wearing anything

    i''ve been happily married for more than 10 years and have a 5- year-old daughter,

    everyone is. of course, they are all tall. (i am 5 foot 2.) now the problem: my
    5-foot-10 sister-in-law has a daughter ("betty") who is a year younger than our
    suzie. whenever the family gets together, they compare them to see who is taller.
    at the last get-together, my mother-in-law said, "i think betty is now taller
    than suzie--let''s measure." then she stood them back to back and loudly announced,
    "look, betty is taller than suzie!" i wanted to say, "so what? what possible difference
    does it make?" i resent the emphasis on height. then i start to feel guilty for
    being short and not producing an amazonian offspring for them. i feel like saying:
    "i''m sorry your son didn''t choose a taller mate. why is height so important?
    does it make a person healthier? more successful?" i was taught that it''s what''s

    he''s teasing, and he assures me that everyone else knows he''s teasing, but i
    still feel uncomfortable when he repeats these old "standards." furthermore, i
    dislike the implications in his statements. he often says, "i''d like to die in
    bed getting shot by a jealous husband." and if another man pays too much attention
    to me, he''ll ask him, "are you trying to steal my wife, you horse thief?" everyone
    laughs, and i always smile and try to act amused, even though one of his little
    jokes assumes sexual activity in another woman''s bed, and the other calls me
    a "horse." i''ve asked him to please stop teasing me that way, but he keeps it
    up. should i continue to smile and act like i don''t care? or can you give me
    a snappy retort i can use to retaliate? hurt in hopatcong, n.j.'

    i love to play the card game pan. in our game, one of the eight players has turned
    out to be a freeloader. the last eight times when it was her turn to host, she
    was either "sick," or her husband was "entertaining a relative," or her maid missed
    coming this week and her house was a mess. however, she has not missed a game
    in a year! now she says her hands hurt (arthritis) so she can''t shuffle the cards,
    but she has no trouble reaching for the chips or reaching for the cards. abby,
    you once wrote: "nobody can take advantage of you without your permission." the
    other women in our group are just as fed up with this woman as i am, but nobody
    has the nerve to call her on it. i told the others that i was going to drop out.
    so since i am always quoting you, they said, "write to dear abby and see what
    she has to say." so i am writing. should i stay with the group and ignore this
    woman''s faults, or drop out and try to organize another game without her? the
    other women said they would all go along with your decision. e.g. in l.a.'

    what should a handicapped woman say to men who ask her to dance? i am a 27-year-old
    graduate student who walks with crutches. i enjoy going out with friends to listen
    to live music, and i put my crutches under the table so no one will trip over
    them. when a man comes over and asks me to dance, a direct "no, thank you" (according
    to my male friends) is seen as snobbish or aloof, and invariably the guy turns
    and walks away without a word. to say, "i really can''t dance" leads to arguments
    that "everyone can dance," or "i can teach you," which is very embarrassing. were
    i to say, "sorry, i''m handicapped," it would cause an outpouring of sympathy,
    followed by a hasty retreat. please don''t suggest that i keep my crutches in
    evidence as a tipoff. i am as flattered as the next woman by an invitation to
    dance. i need a quick, clever answer that won''t embarrass either party. your
    answer will not only help me, it will remind people to control the urge to say
    something sympathetic or to hurry away when they meet someone with a handicap.
    finally, it may teach men to react in a more civil manner to a woman who, for
    whatever reason, turns down an invitation to dance. eva in beaverton'

    there''s something that i''ve never understood about wedding invitations. they

    the poems of lincoln kirstein atheneum, 320 pages, $25 lincoln kirstein is, among
    other things, a cofounder and the general director of the new york city ballet--the
    man who gave us the chance to encounter the work of this century''s greatest choreographer,
    the late george balanchine. but in addition to being an important impresario of
    the arts, the 80- year-old kirstein has produced a good-sized body of verse about
    his experiences as a soldier in world war ii, originally published in 1964 as
    "rhymes of a pfc." and reissued now with 30 new poems and subtitled "ballads urban
    and suburban." as the words "rhyme" and "ballad" suggest, kirstein is a very unfashionable
    poet. fond of elaborate stanza forms and devoted to a singsong use of meter and
    rhyme, he cites rudyard kipling as his model, pays scrupulous attention to external
    events and would, one assumes, be proud to claim the title of "storyteller." the
    stories kirstein tells in his new batch of poems have a wide range. in "buttons"
    a "50-ish frump" asks a puerto rican elevator boy into her apartment, suggests
    that she would welcome a sexual encounter, then furiously rejects him. in "false
    alarm" a man thinks he has colon cancer, and "dear abby" is a takeoff on advice
    columns. but the army poems are still kirstein''s best because there he confronts
    the question that has shaped all of his endeavors: how does one manage extreme
    situations? "the structure of the military," he has said, "is about organized
    lives." and kirstein thinks of ballet in the much same way ("there''s nothing
    aimless about it"), regardless of the cost in human terms. ("if balanchine was
    a tyrant," he said recently, "and deformed these children and forced them into
    anorexia and suicide, that''s something else again.") so kirstein finds poetic
    structures that imitate the order he sees in military life, jamming all sort of
    flotsam and jetsam into his deliberately artificial frameworks. kirstein admires
    gen. george patton, under whom he served: "patton''s a combat artist; hence his
    palette runs to red;/makes superior generals anxious he''s prone to lose his head,/spoil
    pretty rhenish landscapes with an april coat of lead:/our man may go too far."
    and his jingle about eisenhower has a similar, goofy charm: "supreme commander,
    ike eisenhower/painter of sorts in pleasant times, our/daddy-o in the unpleasing
    times,/whose decent manner, common sense, justice, stump weak rhymes;/who endured
    stupendous waiting,/winning worst wars with the least hating." but in kirstein''s
    best war poems, the wrought-iron structures begin to melt into something more
    humane. in "vet" he looks at a survivor of the normandy landing and writes: "just
    three weeks after our great act/he can''t recall half his own wild/ sobbing advance.
    high on a dune,/this prematurely aging child,/a mite of history he helped make,/rubs
    stubble chin, and spends a sigh,/tomorrow he''ll be down the line/waiting one
    more chance to die." and in the brutal "4th armored," where combat is confronted
    directly, kirstein''s rhymes disappear altogether, as though he knew that such
    events must dance to their own deadly music. caption: photo: lincoln kirstein'

    centers on a wall street investment banker who accidentally gets entangled in
    new york''s "criminal injustice system." according to the publisher, though, wolfe
    has radically overhauled the book since its magazine serialization. truman capote
    never got around to revising or completing "answered prayers" before his death
    in 1984. so the "unfinished" novel that will be published next month consists
    solely of the three indiscreet chapters that appeared in esquire 10 years ago,
    to the mortification of his intimate friends in new york cafe society. both the
    wolfe and capote novels should get a major boost from their early public exposure,
    but they have no monopoly on the media spotlight this fall, not with competition
    from such high-profile novelists as kurt vonnegut, jimmy breslin, danielle steel,
    stephen king and marilyn french, or nonfiction supernovas like bob woodward, stephen
    birmingham, germaine greer and john kenneth galbraith, all of whom are represented
    by new books. near the top of that list of celebrity authors, add the name of
    james michener. though "legacy" is a novel, it is, like most of michener''s books,
    a potpourri of fact and fiction, which offers a timely lesson in american patriotism,
    as it traces his fictional starr family from shay''s rebellion to the civil war
    to the iran-contra hearings. at 176 pages, "legacy" is a departure for michener,
    whose previous novels were more notable for quantity than quality. but if michener
    does short-change epic fanciers, the slack will be taken up by a number of other
    novelists who have produced leviathans. the biggest of these may well be william
    safire''s "freedom," a civil war novel that, at more than 1,200 pages, is windier
    than margaret mitchell''s classic saga. however, safire faces a monumental challenge
    from edward rutherfurd, whose novel "sarum" covers 10,000 years of english history,
    from the ice age to the present, in nearly 1,000 pages. among the other light
    heavyweights are gary jennings'' multi-ring circus, "spangle"; clive barker''s
    fantasy, "weaveworld"; and john jakes'' "heaven and hell," the grandiose finale
    to his kent family trilogy. from all reports, shirley conran''s "savages" is no
    slender package either, not with the author having to manipulate five corporate
    wives in their struggle for "survival and power." not quite so ambitious, maureen
    "mo" dean, of watergate infamy, has only three women to deal with in "washington
    wives," while danielle steel follows the fortunes of three sisters in "kaleidoscope."
    maternal bonds are the subject of marilyn french''s "her mother''s daughter."
    stephen king has already had three novels on best-seller lists this year, and
    there''s no reason to suppose he won''t have a fourth when "the tommyknockers"
    arrives, probably before the fall colors. other candidates for best-sellerdom
    are garrison keillor''s new grabbag of lake wobegon tales, "leaving home"; pulitzer
    prize-winning newspaper columnist jimmy breslin''s "he got hungry and forgot his
    manners"; and tama janowitz''s "a cannibal in manhattan," her successor to "slaves
    of new york." bret easton ellis, who scored with his first novel, "less than zero,"
    may have another winner among the young and the trendy with "the rules of attraction."
    kurt vonnegut''s "bluebeard" is a mock autobiography of the painter rabo karabekian,
    who made a cameo appearance in "breakfast of champions." gail godwin, like vonnegut
    a crossover writer popular with both mass audiences and the hardcore literati,
    has a potential critical and commercial champion with "a southern family," as
    do toni morrison with "beloved," george higgins with "outlaws," and dan greenburg
    with "the nanny." high among the more purely literary lights is wallace stegner,
    a pulitzer prize- and national book award-winning author whose "crossing to safety"
    is being published on the 50th anniversary of the publication of his first novel.
    from home and abroad, the fall season will also bring fiction by such respected
    novelists as margaret drabble ("the radiant way"); jack fuller ("our father''s
    shadows"); thomas keneally ("playmaker"); stanley elkin ("the rabbi of lud");
    barry hannah (""hey jack!"); and robert coover ("whatever happened to gloomy gus
    of the chicago bears?"). shifting the focus to nonfiction, the most incendiary
    of the season''s books is likely to be bob woodward''s expose of the cia''s "secret
    wars." the documentary is supposedly so "top secret" that the publisher refuses
    to divulge the title; but woodward, the watergate journalist who helped topple
    richard nixon and all the president''s henchman, is reported to be as rough on
    cia director william casey as he was on john belushi in "wired." the cia is also
    expected to take its lumps, along with the white house, organized crime and american
    business, in "the marcos dynasty," by sterling seagrave, whose previous venture
    into far eastern skulduggery, "the soong dynasty," was popular with both critics
    and readers. american dynasties, such as the rockefellers and the kennedys, are
    the province of peter collier and david horowitz, whose new multigenerational
    biography is "the fords: an american epic." the fords may be also among the families
    who figure in "america''s secret aristocracy," which is what stephen ("our crowd")
    birmingham melodramatically calls the loose confederation of the country''s oldest,
    wealthiest, most influential families. more than 25 years after he left his mark
    with "the affluent society," john kenneth galbraith is back with "economics in
    perspective," a necessarily broad but incisive survey of economic thought, from
    aristotle to keynes and reganomics. after a brief sojourn to el salvador for her
    last book, "salvador," joan didion moves on to "miami," for what is sure to be
    an equally distinctive treatment of that volatile tropical metropolis. after pondering
    "the fate of the earth," jonathan schell turns his attention to milwaukee, which
    serves as his microcosm for american political life during the 1984 reagan-mondale
    campaign. germaine greer sorts out her thoughts on everything from the famine
    in ethiopia to jimi hendrix in "the madwoman''s underclothes: essays and occasional
    writings." arthur miller''s autobiography, "timebends," would be remarkable if
    only for the glimpse into his marriage to marilyn monroe, but that will no doubt
    be a discreet and relatively brief chapter in the playwright''s rich, eventful
    and troubled life. on the 25th anniversary of her suicide, monroe is the subject
    of two other books, an appreciation by eve arnold and a "photographic odyssey"
    edited by guus luijters. there are also stellar books by or about katharine hepburn,
    shirley maclaine, vivien leigh, marlon brando, oprah winfrey, elizabeth taylor,
    howdy doody, judy collins, myrna loy, bess myerson, patty duke, chuck berry and
    bill cosby (whose followup to "fatherhood" is "time flies," reflections on aging).
    the picture of "oscar wilde" that emerges from richard ellmann''s november biography
    may not rank with his landmark portrait of james joyce, but it''s bound to be
    season''s grandest literary monument. the only challenge may come from victoria
    glendinning, with her biography of rebecca west. by most accounts, ann landers
    and abigail van buren have had a longtime sibling and professional rivalry. whatever
    their differences, the twin columnists will be reunited in "dear ann, dear abby"
    by jan pottker and bob speziale. because their "unauthorized biography" purports
    to tell the truth about the sisters'' lives and "perfect" marriages, however,
    this may not be an entirely happy reunion. caption: drawing: cover illustration

    my fiance and i are planning our wedding, and we want to invite some friends from
    work. these are the coworkers we socialize with outside of work. we''re not inviting

    we don''t want to offend those who aren''t invited, but we can''t afford to have

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    sometimes when i am near my wife she breaks out in hives. but then, betty also
    suffers an occasional bout of hives when i am not around, so my role in her hives
    may be negligible. then again it may not be. that''s the thing about hives. for
    some people they are totally predictable: eat strawberries and get hives. but
    for many others, hives is an annoyance that strikes as mysteriously as love. maybe
    that''s it: i am so lovable that i give betty hives. a mother wrote to dear abby
    some time ago and said that her son howard gave her hives whenever he came home
    from college. abby told her not to let howard move back home when he graduated.
    for howard''s benefit, and maybe mine, but more for those around us who get hives,
    here is a basic rundown on the ailment and some of what is available as treatment.
    hives are itchy patches of raised bumps on the skin. these are called wheals,
    and they range from freckle size to several inches across. it is estimated that
    10 percent to 20 percent of the u.s. population suffers from acute hives at some
    time. usually these are brief, scattered encounters that can be traced to a precise
    cause: taking medication such as penicillin or aspirin or from eating such foods
    as strawberries or shellfish. part of the obvious treatment for such hives is
    to avoid the cause, said dr. richard vandellen, a consultant in allergy diseases
    at the mayo clinic. the mechanics of this type of hives are similar to an allergic
    reaction in which skin cells release antibodies, vandellen said. one of the antibodies
    is histamine, hence the wide use of antihistamines in allergy and hives treatment.
    for those who suffer from chronic hives, and their numbers are small compared
    to victims of the acute type, the cause and effect are not so simple. usually
    it is impossible to pinpoint what causes the hives, and about all the victims
    can do is seek treatment. "with a few rare exceptions," vandellen said, "we can
    find a drug or a combination of drugs that will give them relief." chronic hives,
    according to vandellen and other mayo doctors, may be caused by infections, exposure
    to heat or cold, medications such as aspirin or aspirin substitutes called ibuprofen,
    emotional upset or food additives such as dyes, preservatives and sulfites. "there
    may be a different mechanism at work than in acute hives," vandellen said. "we
    really don''t know yet, but a similiar treatment approach, using antihistamines,
    is the best we can do at this point." there are many antihistamines available,
    some of which are known by the trade names benadryl, vistaril, atarax and periactin.
    another antihistamine called terfenadine, with the trade name seldane, has been
    widely used to treat hives in europe, but the food and drug administration has
    approved its use only for allergy treatment, vandellen said. its advantage over
    other antihistamines is that it does not cause as much drowsiness. u.s. approval
    for use against hives is pending. inducing a certain amount of drowsiness may,
    however, be important to successful treatment in some cases because it helps alleviate
    symptoms, according to dr. henry roenigk, chairman of the dermatology department
    at the northwestern university medical school. though seldane is getting much
    publicity, roenigk said he thinks the dermatology community does not consider
    it as much of a breakthrough as the manufacturer contends. the drug doxepin, with
    the trade names sinequan and adapin, is also being used with success. this is
    an antidepressant, vandellen said, and is sometimes used to treat hives that resist
    other drugs. there is another kind of hives called dermographia in which the skin
    erupts in response to being stroked with a fingernail or pencil. my daughter pat
    has this condition occasionally. it is the skin''s reaction to pressure and involves
    the same physical mechanics as other hives. as for itching in regard to hives:
    do you scratch or don''t you, given that the urge to do so, according to my wife,
    is sometimes enough to drive you to kick the furniture? you don''t, according
    to vandellen. "scratching will probably just make hives feel worse," he said,
    "and in some cases hives are so widespread that scratching is impractical anyway."
    "you can apply a cortisone cream or cold tap-water compresses," he said. "be patient,"
    vandellen advises hives sufferers. "in almost all cases, the hives will go away
    eventually." hives, though they are most commonly only an irritation, can also
    be painful and disabling, particularily if they occur on the palms or on the soles
    of the feet. there is also a rare type of hives called angioedema, which produces
    swelling in large colorless areas, usually around the lips, eyelids, tongue and
    throat. rapid swelling in the upper airways can also result, and it can become
    so severe that breathing is impaired. suffocation is even possible. years ago,
    betty had several of these kinds of attacks in which her eyes and face suddenly
    swelled to a frightening degree. once it happened when we were at a party and
    we thought it was an allergic reaction to something she had eaten. angioedema,
    when it begins to affect breathing, is a medical emergency, vandellen and other
    mayo doctors warned. writing in a recent issue of the mayo health letter, they
    said, "report to a hospital emergency room immediately if you have these symptoms.
    an injection of epinephrine may be necessary to provide relief." since the party
    incident, betty has undergone a series of allergy treatments and has not had a
    recurrence of angioedema, if that''s what it was. i have wondered if it could
    have been something i said at the party that upset her and caused the dangerous
    hives. but vandellen said that those instances in which hives are caused by emotions
    are not common. "it is pretty rare for someone to get hives because of another
    person," he said. but it could happen, he added. i''m not sure where all of this
    leaves howard and me. perhaps we should write to dear abby.'

    forgive me if i do a little nit-picking. enclosed is a clipping from your column
    in which you wrote: "i think he is a troubled man and his behavior should be reported
    to whomever is his superior." abby, "whomever" is not the object of the preposition
    "to"; the whole clause is. thus, the sentence should read: "i think he is a troubled
    man and his behavior should be reported to whoever is his superior," "whoever"
    being the subject of the verb "is". i usually don''t find myself perturbed enough
    to write letters about misuse of english appearing in the newspapers. however,
    i''m sure many readers would say, "if dear abby wrote it that way, it must be

    last week my closest friend and i decided to take a day off just to have fun.
    we are both married women in our 30s and hold responsible jobs. we are not crazy,
    and we''re not on drugs or alcohol--we just love to laugh. we drove to solvang,
    a small danish community, for a day of sightseeing and relaxation. while browsing
    through one of the many shops, we came upon a lamp. i can''t describe it, but
    it was the ugliest thing either of us had ever seen. we started to giggle, then
    laugh, then roar at the thought of anyone spending $850 for that monstrosity!
    we hastily left the shop lest we offend the owner, and collapsed on a bench outside.
    we were both in one of those moods when everything was hilarious, and we spent
    the entire day in stitches. passers-by made comments, indicating that they thought
    we were either drunk or high on drugs. a waitress in one restaurant said she couldn''t
    serve us "anything more" to drink! of course, this made us laugh all the harder.
    abby, when did it become a crime to laugh heartily? we were not obnoxious --just
    a little noisy perhaps. we left every store when we felt the urge to break up,
    and by the time we got outside tears were running down our faces. but, so what?
    laughter is good for the soul. this is probably too long for your column, but
    it''s important to remind people that it''s ok to laugh. so if you see someone
    laughing loudly (even hysterically), don''t condemn him--join him. somehow i think
    you will understand, abby. and yes, you may use my name. cathleen kalbreier, westminster,

  body: 'dear readers: recently i volunteered the information that i was born with
    two teeth and my sister, dear abby, was born with one. a woman wrote that she
    too was born with a tooth and believed it to be a rare occurrence. she wondered
    if i knew of any famous people who had been born with teeth. i had never heard
    of anyone except my sis and me, so i decided to run a survey. the questions: were
    you born with teeth? if so, how many? are you famous? at this moment i am beginning
    to wonder if anyone in this world was not born with teeth. to date, i''ve received
    42,000 responses, and the cards and letters still are pouring in. almost 80 percent
    of the respondents were born with two teeth. almost 17 percent were born with
    one tooth. two percent were born with three teeth. only 1,000 readers were born
    with four teeth. ninety percent of those who specified the location said the teeth
    were in the lower jaw. the survey did not turn up anyone who was famous, although
    one reader said he was in who''s who and had been captain of the high school football
    team in la crosse, wis. why are some babies born with teeth? according to dr.
    paul goldhaber, harvard''s dean of dental medicine, teeth develop in utero and
    the baby born with visible teeth merely exhibits premature development. how often
    does this occur? the journal of the american dental association (september, 1984)
    reported on a study by dentists kates, needleman and holmes. they observed 17,155
    newborns and found that 10 were born with teeth. a more casual study involving
    11,000 newborns turned up one child with a tooth (or teeth) in every 3,667 births.
    here is a sample of what my week has been like: burlington, vt.: my son was born
    with two teeth. they were loose but the doctor said to leave them alone. three
    days later the teeth were gone. i was horrified, thinking he had swallowed them,
    but we found them under his crib the next day. he is not famous but might be one
    day. he began to speak in full sentences at 13 months. milwaukee: my daughter
    was born with two teeth. this was noted on her health certificate under "abnormalities."
    i didn''t care for the designation. des moines: i wasn''t born with teeth but
    i had vertical toenails on my fifth toes. my shoes never fit until the podiatrist
    filed the nails down. santa barbara: i was born with one tooth on aug. 1, 1943.
    i read that peter the great was born with a tooth, and the gypsy midwife who delivered
    him said it was a sign of greatness. as you know, he became czar of russia. spring
    hill, fla.: my first child weighed 13 pounds at birth and had two teeth. my second
    child weighed 16 pounds and had three teeth. my mother''s last son weighed 18
    pounds and had no teeth. omaha, neb.: a few minutes after my son was born, the
    doctor asked me if i planned to breast-feed him. i replied, "yes." he said, "this
    kid has two very sharp teeth. i''d better take them out tomorrow." he did and
    i thanked him. no location, please: our son was born with two teeth, and the doctor
    who delivered him said, "this child will be a great leader one day." he became
    president of a distinguished university and serves there today. every survey turns
    up a few clowns. this one lives in greensboro, n.c. he wrote:'

    thank you for referring to whistling as "a joyful sound." i was shocked and dismayed
    at the number of readers who hated whistling. the complainers might be interested
    in knowing that many people who are renowned in other musical art forms are also
    whistlers. for example, patrice munsell studied whistling as a child. she gave
    a whistling recital when she was 12, and at 14 it occurred to her that she might
    be able to sing as well as she could whistle. luciano pavarotti is another fine
    whistler. he whistles his operatic scores to "warm up" before appearances. i,
    too, am a whistler. there are many of us far less renowned who take whistling
    very seriously, and devote many hours of practice to whistling. we also invest
    a great deal of time and money to travel to distant locations to perform for people
    who appreciate superb whistling, and to promote whistling as an art form. for
    your readers who want to whistle with the "whistling greats" or hear great whistlers
    perform, there are two large whistling conventions and competitions held annually:
    the national whistlers convention in louisburg, n.c., in april, and the international
    whistle-off in carson city, nev., in august. i love to whistle and have been whistling
    since i was 5. my favorite composer is puccini. jeanne e. hum, palos verdes, calif.

    i''ve never written for advice before, but this issue cannot be resolved by any

    who occasionally looks into our bedroom window at night. our bedroom is on the
    first floor, facing a woods, and would be considered very private. we also have
    blinds, but because i sometimes leave the bedroom windows open, the blinds blow
    to the side. i have not called the police because the "tom" is our next-door neighbor.
    he is a respected professional man and has always been a friend to my husband
    and me, and his wife and children are very dear to us. we are angry and frustrated
    and don''t know what to do. i''m on the verge of confronting him, and if i do,
    it will forever change our relationship with him. (i''m assuming he will deny
    it.) i''ve already told his wife that i''d seen "someone" at our window, and to

    my son, "charles," who is almost 14, has always had a wonderful relationship with
    my father-his grandfather-until a few months ago. for about a year and a half,
    charles would stop at his grandpa''s on the way to school, and they would have
    breakfast together. charles even had a key to dad''s house, and would start preparing
    breakfast while dad was shaving. this, of course, was on school days. however,
    one saturday morning, charles had to be at school to practice for a play. he went
    to his grandpa''s as he usually did on school days, let himself in with his own
    key and found grandpa having breakfast with an attractive lady-both in their pajamas!
    charles never did go to school for play practice. instead, he stormed home and
    locked himself in his room. now he will talk to no one, and rushes out of the
    room when his once-beloved grandpa visits us. we are all terribly upset by his
    attitude. dad is heartbroken because he can''t seem to get through to his only
    grandson. dad has been a widower for over eight years. the lady is well-known
    to my wife and me. she is a lovely person and a widow. how can we get through
    to charles and persuade him that dad has not committed a terrible crime? don''t
    suggest our minister, abby. he is rather conservative and does not approve of
    "living in sin." canadian dad'

  subject: THE FAME GAME IS DIFFERENT FOR TWINS
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    if you''re a twin, here''s some bad news for you: don''t plan on ever becoming
    famous. the following is based on purely unscientific research, but no one to
    whom i have talked has ever heard of a twin who has become famous while his or
    her twin brother or twin sister has remained anonymous. that is, if you have a
    twin brother or sister, you''d better hope that the two of you become famous together-because
    there''s no chance that you will become famous on your own. of course, there are
    cases of twins who have both become very famous. the classic example is those
    two women from iowa who write under the names of ann landers and dear abby. all
    they''ve done is become the most successful newspaper columnists in the world.
    (i was going to mention the everly brothers next, but they''re not twins. they
    ought to be, though.) so if you and your twin brother or sister want to become
    a singing duo or a trapeze act, you just might make it (although, come to think
    of it, how famous do trapeze acts really get these days?). if you want to try
    for fame on your own, though-leaving your twin brother or sister behind-forget
    it. it''s not going to happen. you may remember, about a year ago, a series of
    advertisements was launched featuring the brothers and sisters of famous people.
    the one i recall the most vividly was johnny carson''s brother, because he looked
    a lot like johnny carson. the point of the ad campaign was twofold: (1) to prove
    that the company in question treated everybody like a star and (2) to save a lot
    of money by not having to hire the stars themselves. it was a cute campaign. unfortunately,
    i can''t say how effective it was, because i have no idea what product or service
    it was advertising. but if you think that the brothers and sisters of famous people
    have problems, think about the twin brothers and sisters of famous people. in
    the case of the aforementioned ad campaign, one might imagine that it was the
    less-famous brother or sister who might have the psychological problem, always
    wondering why he or she never quite made it. in the case of twins, though, i suspect
    that it would be the famous member of the pair of twins who would be tormented.
    which is why there are no famous individual twins. let''s take the most well-known
    twin in the world: elvis presley. in case you didn''t know it, elvis had a twin
    brother, jesse, who died at birth. (i''m slowly decompressing from graceland;
    before long, you won''t be seeing elvis references here so often. i promise.)
    anyway . . . one of the most painful things in elvis presley''s life was the loss
    of jesse at birth. but it could be argued that, if jesse presley had lived, elvis
    presley would never have become a star. think about it: here''s young elvis, touring
    the south as a 21-year-old rockabilly singer-and here''s his twin brother jesse,
    maybe sitting around the phi delt house at ole miss. jesse would say to his college
    friends, "yeah, elvis might have been here, too, but he didn''t do all that great
    on his sats." the point is that stars are stars precisely because they are unique.
    and twins-even though they aren''t the same person, and are doubtless unique in
    their own minds-don''t seem unique to others. they seem to be the same person-
    especially when they''re identical twins. so if you set out to become a star,
    and you''re a twin, you''re always going to be burdened by the fact that there''s
    another version of you running around, looking just like you and talking just
    like you. you may become a success-you may even become more successful than your
    twin brother or sister, if that matters to you-but you aren''t going to be a star.
    it would be too confusing to the public. i apologize for bringing such bad tidings.
    but it''s true; if you''re a twin, the best you can hope for is to do better than
    your twin brother or sister, and let that be enough to satisfy you. a pair of
    twins like ann and abby come along only once in a generation of so; you can try
    to be like them, and both become world-famous. but become a star on your own,
    and leave your twin in the shadows? sorry. it''s just not going to happen. that
    shadow is always going to be there to pull you down. caption: photo: ann landers

    my wife and i recently visited our son and his family in a distant city for the
    first time since their return from a foreign assignment. they have two children,
    ages 3 and 5. on the crowded bookshelf in the guest room, we noticed two currently
    popular books on lovemaking, complete with explicit drawings. these books are
    probably long since forgotten by our son and his wife, but when junior discovers
    them, he will have some engrossing reading. we thought of reminding our son that
    the books were there; we also considered moving them to a less accessible spot,
    or making them "disappear." we finally did nothing and said nothing. what would

    my husband travels for his business about three or four days a month. we''ve been
    married for four years, and i really do love him. one of my friends (she''s divorced)
    invited me to her place for a party, and she had a lot of unattached guys and
    girls there. anyway, i got very drunk and went to bed with a guy i had never seen
    before. i couldn''t believe it until he showed me the evidence; he had some guy
    take pictures of us "in the act." now i am being blackmailed. the guy i went to
    bed with is a big coke user and he is hitting me up for money. i don''t have a
    whole lot, but i''m not about to help him support his habit. i''ve given him $100
    twice, then $50 another time, with a promise to give him more when i get it. what

    and relatives. useless to the thief, but a terrible inconvenience to replace.

    this concerns the minister who felt left out because he was not paid for having

    he could not understand why he was expected to perform the marriage service for
    free. he asked advice from other ministers. i have been an episcopal (anglican)
    priest for 28 years, and have never charged for solemnizing a wedding (or any
    other ministration). indeed, i have always told couples that i had no fee, expected
    none and wanted none. my reason? officiating at weddings, baptisms, funerals,
    etc. is what my parish pays me to do. requesting or accepting fees in addition
    to my salary (not large, but adequate) is, i believe, morally wrong, as my ministrations

    please answer this in your column because i am sure i am not the only one who
    doesn''t know. excuse my ignorance, but what is a "round- robin" letter? what
    does it contain? how is it started and kept in circulation? i am interested in
    starting one because our family is so scattered. my younger sisters and i come
    from a family that has never been close, and we are trying very hard to get to

    our son is 3 years old. our daughter is 5. my parents live an hour away-by car.
    i recently phoned and asked them to come and stay with their grandchildren for
    a weekend while we attend a convention in another city. my mother immediately
    checked to see if the dates (two months away) were on their "rv group" weekend.
    since we so rarely ask them to baby-sit, and the children love "nini and papa"
    so much, i was hurt, and wrote and told them so. mother wrote back, listing her
    priorities as follows: (1) her job. (she sells real estate.) (2) her favorite
    activity. (taking rv group trips with her husband, who is retired.) (3) her grandchildren.
    needless to say, i engaged a baby sitter. my parents are now saying that we should
    understand their need for freedom. abby, they have stayed with our children overnight
    only once in a year and a half, when we delivered the kids- never have they driven
    to our home to baby-sit for the evening. we have decided never again to ask them
    for anything. are we right or wrong to feel as we do? third place but no show'

    in response to your fidelity survey: my husband of six years told me a year ago
    that he had been unfaithful "once." i was devastated, and decided to "get even"
    with him, so i had a four-time affair with another man. i told my husband about
    my affair some months later, and he was not the least bit jealous. he hardly reacted
    at all-as though he didn''t care. i had expected him to harp on me about it like
    i still harp on him. let me tell you, abby, his lack of jealousy hurt me as much
    as when i learned about his one- nighter. why didn''t he react to my affair like
    i reacted to his? does this show a lack of love for me on his part-or a lack of

    i am flabbergasted at your answer to "the boxer rebellion" ! i can''t believe

    have you ever looked at a man''s boxer shorts? i have dozens of them, by different
    manufacturers, and every one of them has an opening in the front big enough to
    stuff a grapefruit through! i sincerely believe that''s half the trouble with
    our younger generation these days-parents not instilling in them a lot of the
    "old values," corny as that may sound. i''m with the parents on this one and believe
    the child will ultimately benefit from being taught to be feminine. and in the
    same column you suggest not turning on a washer-dryer until one knows where the

    fifteen years ago i had a whirlwind romance with a young man from south america.
    i married him, only to find out a month later that he was in the united states
    illegally and was only interested in obtaining residency by marrying a u.s. citizen.
    i was hurt, packed my things and left him. shortly after that, he went to his
    country''s embassy. they put him on a cargo plane and sent him "home" at his request.
    the problem is, we were never divorced because i was never able to get in touch
    with him after he left this country. after several months of trying to locate
    him, i gave up. seven years ago, i met a truly wonderful man who wanted to marry
    me. i said yes, and we were married and now have three children. i finally told
    him i had never been divorced from my south american husband. we both want to
    correct this, but my husband is in the military and i''m afraid it might hurt
    his military career should this come out. to whom should we go to talk confidentially,
    and what are the consequences involved for my husband, me and our children? there
    is no way of getting in touch with my "ex." he disappeared from the face of the
    earth. please help me. worried in texas'

  subject: ANY WOMAN CAN BE ABUSE VICTIM
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'dear readers: every day more than 2 million women in this country are abused
    physically and emotionally in their homes by someone they live with. domestic
    abuse is the most common violent crime in this country. every 18 seconds a woman
    is battered. any woman can be a victim of abuse: any age, race, culture, sexual
    preference or class. abuse takes many forms. it ranges from insults, put-downs
    and threats, to slaps, punches, choking, rape, stabbing and, all too often, death.
    why does a woman stay in an abusive situation? because of . . . fear: if she leaves
    he will find her and kill her. guilt: somehow the abuse was her fault. shame,
    embarrassment: she doesn''t want friends or family to know, can''t admit that
    the marriage/relationship isn''t working. low self-esteem, helplessness: she feels
    she can''t make it on her own, can''t support her children, will never find someone
    else to "love" her. she may have no money, no place to go, no help or support
    from friends or family. she may be physically ill. she might still be hoping he
    will change and wishing for a "happily ever after" that doesn''t exist. any or
    all of these factors make it difficult for a battered woman to escape the violence
    that rules her life. men who abuse come from every class, race, culture, age and
    occupation. they can be poor and unemployed or rich and powerful. many were abused
    as children or witnessed abuse. their anger, insecurity and low self-esteem are
    expressed through violence and abuse. domestic violence exists in every culture
    and society all over the world. it is a shameful part of our history hidden and
    ignored until the 1970s. it exists because of centuries of sexist attitudes and
    beliefs that condone and excuse the abuse of women by husbands, lovers, fathers,
    all men. some facts -over 50 percent of sexual assaults take place in a residence
    of some kind. -50 to 60 percent are "acquaintance rapes" -- the assailants know
    or are "friends" or relatives of the victims. -71 percent of all types of sexual
    assaults are planned. -the fbi estimates that only one out of 10 sexual assaults
    are reported. -in 93 percent of sexual assaults, the victim and assailant are
    of the same race and socioeconomic class. -victims range in age from infancy to
    their 90s, and every race, class and culture. any time a woman is coerced or forced
    into sexual relations without complete voluntary consent, she has been sexually
    assaulted. no woman asks to be raped. no woman deserves to be sexually assaulted.
    what to do if you are sexually assaulted: -call the police. they will take you
    for medical treatment if you need or want it. they will ask for a description
    of the assailant and the attack. (you do not have to report the assault or press
    charges, but i recommend it.) -get medical treatment immediately at an emergency
    room, clinic or from your personal physician. you may have received internal injuries
    or been exposed to venereal disease, and there is the possibility of pregnancy.
    remember: do not bathe or shower. valuable evidence will be destroyed. save the
    clothes you were wearing at the time of the assault. as soon as you are able,
    write down as many of the details of the attack as you can remember.'
