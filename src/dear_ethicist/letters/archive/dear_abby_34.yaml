    my younger sister "lainie" is 14. she has had a smartphone for about a year. while
    i don''t belong to any social media sites, lainie is a social media junkie. she
    never goes anywhere without her phone. sometimes she''ll have her phone in one
    hand and her tablet in the other, taking turns when one or the other begins to
    bore her. it''s almost impossible to interact with her because her face is buried
    in the virtual world just about every hour of the day and night. i miss the way
    things used to be before she got that smartphone. i have talked about this with
    my parents. while they are equally concerned about lainie''s withdrawn, sometimes
    secretive behavior, they never do anything about it. what are your thoughts on
    this topic? -- gadget girl''s sister in new mexico'

    not good enough for my wife.) on game night, when i get home she gives me the

    last year, my 40-year-old stepson, "rod," gave his father a beautiful robe for
    christmas. the problem is, we had given the robe to rod for christmas several
    years ago. i didn''t say anything at the time, but, of course, i recognized it
    because i was the one who had bought it for him. should i have said anything?
    or was i right to have played dumb (which is what i did)? rod has "saved" other
    presents we have given him and regifted them to us years later. this man has a
    high-paying job and isn''t hurting for money. i think what he''s doing is insulting.

  body: 'dear readers: years ago, a young mother in arlington, va., wrote my mother
    about a book she had received that promised to help parents prepare their children
    for school by expanding their vocabulary. the "secret"? reading to them while
    they are small. children learn words by hearing them spoken in context -- the
    more they hear, the more they absorb. like everything else, reading is something
    people will do more of if they enjoy it. when a parent reads to a child, the child
    associates reading with pleasure. "the read-aloud handbook" by jim trelease became
    a huge best-seller when it was published. penguin books called it one of the 75
    most important books it has published in its history. the book is now in its seventh
    -- and last -- edition and has been completely revised and updated. if you''re
    a parent who wants your child to succeed, a grandparent, or someone contemplating
    becoming a parent in the future, pick up a copy. the first half is filled with
    the latest research on the importance of literacy for children''s success; the
    rest lists book titles and ages of the youngsters for which they''re intended.
    to learn more about the author, visit www.trelease-on-reading.com. to order the

    my husband and i have the same argument every year around thanksgiving. he says
    there is a difference between stuffing and dressing. i say they''re the same thing,
    except that stuffing is baked in the turkey, while dressing is baked separately
    in a casserole dish. my husband insists i''m wrong -- that the difference has
    nothing to do with how it''s cooked. he thinks stuffing is made with regular bread,

    i''m 19 and in college on a scholarship. i have decided to declare an art major.
    i have found a part-time job that will give me a little extra income -- figure

    modeling. it isn''t the only job i plan on taking, but it will help me out for
    the time being. studying the human figure is essential for any art student, and
    it is something that has been done for centuries. when i told my parents, it was
    not well-received. my mother strongly disagreed with my choice and handed the
    phone to my sister, who told me if i want to take my clothes off i should be a
    stripper. abby, this hurt me deeply. my dad is worried that it will ruin my reputation.
    i find it hypocritical because my mom was an art major and her portfolio contains
    nude figures she drew. my school is diligent about the safety and respect of its
    models, and i trust them. i''d like to take this job for the experience, and it
    will allow me to make more connections within the department i''ll be studying

    while volunteering last year with a moms'' group, i met a woman i''ll call "beverly."
    we worked on a project together and that was the last i saw of her. i heard she
    recently lost her daughter in a terrible accident. our group rallied around her
    to provide meals for her family. at that time i asked the volunteer chairwoman
    about taking a meal to beverly. the chairwoman didn''t respond until a couple
    of weeks later. now i''m wondering if i should still take a meal over there. how

    this is my wife''s second marriage. when we were dating, she led me to believe
    that i was the second sexual partner she had ever had. shortly after our wedding,
    i found out through some mutual acquaintances she had attended college with that
    she had been very promiscuous during her college years and that the number of
    men she has been with is far greater than two. i feel lied to and trapped in my
    marriage. (if i had known this, i would not have married her.) she knows i know.
    she dismissed it by saying the past doesn''t matter, but what she fails to recognize
    is that it matters to me. i can''t help but wonder if she has lied to me about

    she''s still married to the man she cheated on, and our son says he''s still in
    love with her. we told our son that because she says the child is his doesn''t
    necessarily mean it is, and if her husband didn''t question the pregnancy, it''s
    possible the child is her husband''s. we advised our son to get a paternity test.
    our son is now so angry with us for suggesting it that he won''t speak to us.
    he said if we can''t support him and the woman he loves, we should stay out of
    his life. he said she plans to leave her husband. (it has been three weeks and
    she''s still there.) i think she was just trying to get our son''s attention.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    recently i took a cue from my sister and her career navy husband. they always
    make it a point to thank anyone they see in military uniform for his/her service
    and sacrifice. i am somewhat shy by nature. but i am so thankful to these men
    and women who fight for our continued freedom that i stepped out of my comfort
    zone to verbalize my feelings and encourage those who cross my path. abby, the
    first and second thank-yous i offered did not go well. the first gentleman i spoke
    to gave me a scornful look and proceeded to tell me i should be thankful for all
    military personnel -- not just him -- and especially those who gave the ultimate
    sacrifice of their lives. i felt 3 inches tall and very embarrassed, but i chalked
    it up to perhaps having said thanks the wrong way, so i tried again. this time
    i thanked a world war ii veteran. i recognized him as a vet by the emblem on the
    bill of the cap he was wearing. his response was, "didn''t have a choice -- it
    was the draft or jail." maybe i''m not cut out for verbalizing my thankfulness,
    or maybe i''m doing it wrong. now my shyness has taken over again. should i silently
    offer a prayer of thanks instead? -- twice bitten in washington'

    i recently found out that after 13 years of marriage, my son and daughter-in-law
    are expecting a child; my first grandchild! i was overjoyed at the news. they
    live about 1,000 miles away from me. i mentioned to my son that i have been looking
    at flights and want to come out a week before her due date so i''ll be there for
    the big moment, and stay three to four weeks to help with the baby. i was shocked
    when he told me they don''t want me to visit until at least three weeks after
    the birth, and stay for one week max. he said my daughter-in-law will need time
    to heal, and they both need time to adjust to being parents before they have guests.
    i am not a "guest." i am the grandmother! i was also told not to expect to take
    care of the baby because it is "their" job. it hurts so bad not to be wanted to
    share in the joy of the new baby. i have always dreamed of watching my grandchild
    take his or her first breath, and see the look on my son''s face when he holds
    his child for the first time. is there anything i can do to change their minds
    and allow me to be there for my son at this important moment? do you agree that

    the trip was taking for so long and so loudly that i ended up "catching" her negative

    i recently broke up with a man i had dated for more than two years. while we were
    together he gave me many gifts of jewelry. yesterday when i was dressing to go
    out, i started to put on a necklace that went with my outfit, then hesitated because
    it had been a gift from him. i knew i''d be seeing him that evening and that i
    would be meeting his new girlfriend. would it have been ok to wear the necklace?
    most of the things he gave me were animal-related because he knew i love animals.
    if someone asks me where i got it, as they often do, what should i say? i don''t

    slouch over the table to get their faces as near the plate as possible, while

    cutlery when setting the table, and have their napkins in their lap only if a

    my question to her is, why not? she deserves better. i am a cancer survivor who

    decision to have a radical mastectomy, i offered my husband the chance to leave.
    (after all, one doesn''t expect "worse" to come so soon after the wedding.) the
    prospect of children, which we had discussed and was important to us, was uncertain
    because of my subsequent chemotherapy. my husband didn''t hesitate. he said, "you
    would not leave me. we will adopt." on our first wedding anniversary i was bald,
    and he treated me to a beautiful, romantic getaway. although i did have reconstruction,
    it was a long process. he was supportive from day one. fifteen years later, i
    was diagnosed with breast cancer again. i had another radical mastectomy followed
    by chemo and reconstruction. abby, my husband again made me feel beautiful even

    i thought it would be better to wait until bella is old enough to understand,
    then tell her what happened and let her decide whether she wants to visit her

    my husband and i have been together for 13 years. we live in the country with

    since i was raised on a farm. my husband wasn''t required to do the same as he
    was growing up. i have asked him for the last 10 years to kindly take his shoes
    off when he comes in so he won''t track dirt, mud, manure, etc. into the house.

    i''m a 14-year-old girl who just started high school. i started to notice boys
    when i was in middle school, and i''d like to start dating soon. the problem is
    i''ve never had a close friend who was a boy, and the idea isn''t natural to me.
    how can i ask a boy out if i don''t even grasp the concept of being friends with
    one? i''m frustrated over this, especially because i really like one particular
    guy. the only advice i have been given is, "get over your fear and just talk to

    my younger sister, "tanya," is 22 and a single mother. her son is 2. she''s pregnant
    again, and this time her baby will be a girl. my sister is very dramatic and emotional.
    she gets angry easily and has a short fuse. she''s great with her son, except
    he picks up on her drama and is somewhat dramatic himself. my worry is that girls
    are more likely to imitate that behavior, and i''m concerned my niece will be
    just like her mother. although tanya has a good heart, her emotional issues have
    caused her to have horrible relationships with men, as our mother did. when i
    suggested to my sister that she talk to someone about her anger, she flipped out

    my husband is 99 percent bed-bound with primary progressive ms. my oldest son
    is bipolar (he''s off his meds and doing great), and my youngest son has asperger''s.
    i know ... wow. my husband refuses to even try to understand the boys. when they
    have behavior problems, he tells them if he could, he would backhand them. great
    parenting, huh? but at the same time, the boys and i are expected to have our
    lives revolve around his disability and stop everything when he needs help. his
    ms is always top priority. i hate watching him go through his disease, but does
    that give him a free pass to bully our boys? i realize the boys (especially the
    younger one) have issues that are difficult to deal with, and i''m not giving
    them a free pass, either, but i feel like i''m stuck between a rock and a hard
    place. if i support my sons, i''m a bad wife. if i support my husband, i''m a

    with her for at least an hour at a time. he said there was nothing more to it.
    i have now insisted that he call her only once a week and in my presence. he''s

    truly cares about her and she makes him laugh. he says he loves only me and will
    never leave me. he''s a good man and i believe him, but ... how should i handle

    reasonable or tickets are available while i wait in the car. i do this so i won''t
    have to find a parking space until we''re sure we will be staying. my wife says
    my doing this is tacky. i believe it is efficient. what are your thoughts, recognizing
    that i usually come up with the short straw on matters of manners? thanks! --

    my children''s nanny, "daisy," has been with us for more than two years. she''s
    not the best, but i know i could do a lot worse. the most important thing is my
    children adore her and she is used to our routine. by and large, i''m happy to
    have her. however, i have two pet peeves i don''t know how to address. daisy is
    always late. not by much, mind you -- but it is consistent. she''s at least five
    minutes late every single day. maybe it shouldn''t bother me so much, but it does.
    i never dock her pay for tardiness, and i always pay her on time. to me, it''s
    a reflection of how important she views her job. i feel it is disrespectful. the
    kicker is, daisy is studying to be a nurse. i have told her unless she breaks
    this bad habit, she''ll be fired from a future nursing job. the second thing is,
    on hot, humid days, daisy has the worst body odor imaginable. when the weather
    is cool, she doesn''t smell, but once sticky weather arrives, the wall of stench
    is enough to make my nose hairs curl. one day it made me physically ill and i
    had to excuse her for the day without explaining why. how should i address these
    problems? or am i making too big a deal out of this? -- having issues in virginia'

    around them. an example: the nine of us went out to dinner and the whole time
    they were speaking to each other in their native tongue while i just sat there.
    then, after dinner, his parents asked why i was so quiet. the family speaks english
    fluently and are otherwise nice to me. when i confronted my boyfriend about it,
    he said it would be disrespectful for him to speak to his elders in english. i

    my father-in-law died two weeks ago. the services were beautiful. many people

    not knowing who sent them and -- we think -- suspects they came from an old or

    to see her compound her grief with these thoughts. we have suggested various reasons
    that someone might have sent the flowers anonymously, but she refuses to accept

    they show in the movies. as you take your family to your favorite swimming hole
    this summer, please be careful. if your child isn''t a competent swimmer, never
    allow him or her to go beyond arm''s reach. never exceed the ratio of two nonswimmers
    to one adult. if possible, stay where the child can touch the bottom. if your
    children can swim and you allow them to go into the pool, lake, ocean without
    you -- always watch them! yes, lifeguards are observing the swimmers -- but no
    one on this planet will watch your child with the same vigilance that you will.
    so put down the book, the e-reader, the tablet, the cellphone and actively watch.
    if you''re chatting with friends, don''t look at them; watch your child. it can
    take as few as 10 to 20 seconds for a person to get into trouble and slip without
    a sound beneath the surface. i guarantee you: your parent-to-child ratio is lower

    my girlfriend, "allison," and i have been in a relationship for two years. we
    met in our sophomore year of high school and have been dating ever since. we have
    an incredible relationship. we were virgins when we started dating, but decided
    we would lose our virginity to each other. we have always used birth control pills
    and condoms to ensure we wouldn''t be having any children. earlier this month
    we had a pregnancy scare. allison had failed to tell me she stopped taking her
    birth control pills three months ago. my trust was broken, but most of all i was
    scared she might be pregnant. it turned out she wasn''t, but because of the incident
    i have been skeptical about making love to her. she says this frustrates her,
    but i have told her the reason i won''t is because she refuses to take the pill.
    abby, we are way too young to have a child and are totally unprepared. i''d still
    like to be intimate with allison, but i''m afraid. what should i do? -- betrayed

    i would like your opinion on the relatively new craze of trashing the wedding
    dress. i think it''s a deplorable waste. i''m sorry i kept mine and watched it
    yellow over the years, but i haven''t heard a reasonable argument for destroying
    the gown. some women say if they have a daughter, she wouldn''t want a dated dress.
    but if the dress is currently in style, i''m sure some less fortunate girl would
    love to have it. rather than trash it, i say why not donate the dress or sell

    feet from our communal fence. (my workshop is right up against the fence.) would

    my wife and i have been married more than 20 years. her best friend from childhood,

    to their home in another state, jack made a pass at my wife. he said he''d always
    had a crush on her and asked her to go to our hotel room and have sex while the
    rest of us were at an amusement park. she refused. we cut our vacation short and
    left for home immediately. she told me about it after we got home, concerned that
    if she said anything while we were there, a confrontation would have ensued. to
    date, jill knows nothing about what occurred. my wife asked me not to say anything
    until she decides what to do. she''s concerned that if she tells jill, the friendship
    will be over. on the other hand, if nothing is said, she will be hiding a guilty

    a relative of mine has a 5-year-old son who is at least 20 or 30 pounds overweight.
    everyone in the family is concerned about it, but no one knows how to bring it
    up to the parents without offending them. we don''t understand how the parents
    or grandparents don''t see his weight as an issue. bullying is a huge deal among
    children, and we fear he might have trouble with other kids his age teasing him.
    however, we are more worried about his health than anything. being that overweight

    at what point is a relationship with a member of the opposite sex considered "cheating"?
    i have recently discovered that my husband was having a more-than-friendly relationship
    with a co-worker. he set up a post office box for her so she could write to him
    while she was away for an extended period. i found her letters and read them.
    they described how she missed my husband and "couldn''t wait to feel" his arms
    around her and his lips on hers again. she said he had shown her what real true
    love can be. she is 12 years younger than he is. my husband says they never had
    sex, but did kiss on several occasions, and he enjoyed their deep, open conversations.
    because my husband is not a big conversationalist, that has been very hard for
    me. the idea that he had meaningful conversations with this woman hurts me more
    than the physical things they admit to. he says it''s not actually cheating if
    they never slept together. i say, with everything he has admitted to and the fact
    he has opened up to her in ways i have begged him to with me, he has definitely
    cheated! this is the second time in our 16-year marriage this kind of thing has
    happened. obviously, his definition of cheating is not the same as mine. i say
    an emotional affair is almost worse than a physical one. he sees cheating as sex

    my wife and i have been married 14 years. during that time her mother has called
    every single day. initially, i was ok with it because we were living in florida
    and she was in iowa. however, since we moved back to iowa to be near her (we live
    three miles apart), she continues to call nightly. sometimes she''ll call during
    dinner or during our "couple''s time" after the kids are asleep. i have expressed
    my dissatisfaction with this, particularly because my wife and mil see each other
    and talk throughout the day. am i out of line to ask for family/couple time during
    which no outside calls come in, or am i being unreasonable? this is a touchy subject,

    i''ll bet you''ve gotten a ton of mail about "mike in missouri" (march 15), who
    was worried about his wife''s declining sex drive. while your point about hormone
    levels is a good one, it could be something simpler than that. i am a wife who
    would love to have sex more often, but i''m tired! i work full-time and do most
    of the household chores. i also do most of the cooking. when my husband heads
    up to the bedroom at 10 o''clock and gives me that "come hither look," i''m not
    in the mood for sex. i''m thinking about the two loads of laundry and the sink
    full of dishes that still need to be done. or i''m trying to remember whether
    i signed that permission slip for our daughter and making a mental note about
    picking up my prescriptions on the way to a client meeting in the morning. speaking
    of prescriptions, is mike''s wife perhaps on birth control pills? those can decrease
    a woman''s sex drive. i took a particular pill for a year before realizing how
    much it killed my desire. my doctor changed the prescription. although there''s
    a big difference, i''m still too tired to do much about it most days. however,
    my husband has figured out i have more energy in the mornings, so his timing is
    better on those "come hither looks." now if i could only get him to help out more

    after conversations with women of all ages, i have concluded that more often than
    not, it is the husband who has caused the wife''s sex drive to diminish, not hormones
    or other physical problems. ask mike how he treats his wife on a daily basis;
    whether he has habits or hygiene that are off-putting; whether he indulges in
    pornography; whether he has taken care of his health and appearance. after 17
    years, is he a good lover? many women are as dissatisfied with their sex lives

    my husband and i invite our friends for dinner quite often, and invitations are

    entertain other people -- just not us. i''m not sure why this is. we would never
    go empty-handed. if we weren''t asked to bring a dessert or an appetizer, we would

    i have been married for 19 years and this is the third time i have caught my wife
    cheating. i didn''t catch her "in the act" because she disguised it behind "vacations
    with her girlfriends." what happened was i caught her sending some guy nude pictures
    of herself and lying about having stayed at a friend''s house. (she had spent
    the night with a guy.) i have remained in this marriage because i wanted to raise
    all my kids before separating or divorcing. i am leaving eventually, but want
    to stay four more years to raise my last son. is it immoral to lie and pretend

    an item from my handbag. carrie was with me, and mentioned she loved my purse
    and then announced she was "stealing it." i realized it wasn''t a joke when she
    dumped the contents of my bag on the kitchen counter in front of several family
    members. she then handed me $10 and put my purse in her car! i was flabbergasted
    and didn''t know how to react. although i had mentioned that i bought the bag
    at a thrift store for less than carrie gave me, i liked it because it is a vintage
    item. i don''t think a replacement will easily be found. while i was always excited
    to see carrie before, i am now leery of seeing her again for fear of a repeat
    of what she did. am i wrong to feel offended? do i have any hope of getting my
    purse back? -- stupefied in new york'

    i have been dating "wayne" for about a year. everything is wonderful, but my problem
    is he is stingy when it comes to issuing a compliment. i''ll get dressed up --
    makeup, hair, the whole thing -- and ask him what he thinks, and his response
    is always, "it''s ok. you always look beautiful to me, so you don''t have to dress
    up." maybe i shouldn''t complain about this, but sometimes i feel wayne would
    say i looked good if i were sick and vomiting into a toilet. it''s not like i

    we moved my elderly parents into an adult assisted-living center last year because
    they were no longer able to safely care for themselves or their home. they have
    now decided to put their house up for sale. our problem is that sometimes when
    we have driven by the house to check that everything''s ok, we have found some
    of the neighbors enjoying the afternoon sitting on my parents'' front porch. the
    house has been shown three times, and one of the times another neighbor was in
    the backyard sitting on the deck. another time, a neighbor walked into the house
    during a private showing. we have been as polite as possible in requesting them
    to please not do this. we finally told them plainly to stay off the property.
    but it continues. we would hate to post "no trespassing" signs for fear that a
    prospective buyer may think there are problems with the neighborhood, and i don''t
    think a sign would deter these perpetrators. any ideas on how to get them to stay
    in their own homes? my sisters and i are starting to think the neighbors don''t
    want the house to sell so they can enjoy it themselves. -- fed up in tennessee'

    living in new york city, public transport is the way to travel. after picking
    up my 5-year-old from school, we took the train home as usual. during the ride,

    man''s arm, he reacted by pushing my son''s head up violently, waking him from

    with a man who is 10 years older. he had recently ended a long-term dating/living
    together relationship. i wasn''t particularly drawn to him, but he was very persistent.
    we finally, jokingly, agreed to be "exclusively casual" and began dating. my children
    don''t dislike him; they are indifferent to him. we have been dating for six years.

    plans for us to be together for this. i don''t want him doing this for me. he''s
    a good man. he deserves someone who wants the devotion he is so willing to give.

    i really like this girl, but my parents absolutely cannot stand her. they hate
    that she has a tattoo and a lip ring, but her appearance has had no effect on
    her professional life, as she is on the road to success in her field. i am not
    writing to ask whether i should stay with her, because i intend to. she''s an
    amazing person, a hard worker, a trustworthy partner and, most of all, she''s
    my best friend. how can i diffuse potentially "combustible" situations with my
    parents, who always try to put her down no matter how often i plead my case? --

    my wife''s niece is marrying a wonderful man of greek descent this summer. her
    grandfather insists that his last name is too long and impossible to pronounce.
    he thinks they need to change the name when they marry. he went so far as to make
    them call him so he could tell them what he wanted. then he gave them 10 days
    to "think about it" and call him back with their answer. he told the mother of
    the bride that if they don''t change the name, then he''s "just not into the wedding
    anymore," implying that he won''t help them pay for the event. needless to say,
    this has most of the family shaking their heads and thinking the old man has finally
    lost it. we understand that this was common practice for families passing through
    ellis island coming to america a century ago, but have you ever heard of this

    our youngest daughter will graduate from college next month. the school is 10

    ethel is not a well woman. she has trouble walking, falls occasionally and hasn''t
    been out of this town for 30 years. she is also hypercritical. she does nothing
    but complain about other people, her health, this country, etc. looking after
    her would be a huge burden. we''d like to attend this milestone event without
    the added stress of taking care of her. my husband and i have been married 25
    years, and ethel still complains about me. because she''s such a handful, we have
    never taken her to dinner or a movie. how do we (kindly) tell her that what she
    has in mind is not going to be possible? -- ready to celebrate in san diego'

    my partner and i have been together 23 years and his parents have embraced me
    as one of their own. a few years ago, we bought his mother a beautiful diamond
    cocktail ring for mother''s day. she''s now 84, and when she passes on, i''d like
    that ring back to have it turned into a ring for my partner. it''s a gesture i''m
    sure would please him, and i hope his mother as well. i believe she''s leaving
    her jewelry to her granddaughter, which is fine. but this particular ring will
    mean so much if i turn it into a ring for her son. would it be tacky for me to
    request this of mom if i tell her why? i don''t want to offend anyone, and i know
    the person who inherits her jewelry will probably pawn or sell it anyway. (i''d

    i am no advice columnist, but may i offer a few wise words to future brides? i
    have been married for 25 years and have never had an argument with my mother-in-law.
    never! my mother gave me some valuable advice before my wedding that i''d like
    to pass along. she said, "always respect the woman who made the man you love."
    i never forgot it, and my mil has always been welcome in my home for as long as
    she wishes. if we had any differences, a respectful dialogue was opened right
    away -- especially if it concerned our kids'' education. we have enjoyed shopping,
    eating, cooking, parties, caring for newborns and family moments together for
    as long as i can remember. sadly, she is now frail and can no longer travel as
    much as she once could. the women who made our husbands deserve all the respect
    we can offer them because if we are happy as wives, it is thanks to all of them.
