    my teenage sister and i both live at home with our single mom. lately she has
    been acting like a teen in love -- giddy, staying out late, and hiding to take
    her phone calls. we have even caught her kissing this man, "gary." mom denies
    any romantic relationship with gary, who is married with children. but when his
    name comes up, she talks endlessly about how mean and horrible his wife is. mom
    has never met his wife, so she must be getting her information from gary. we overheard
    him tell mom that his wife had found his cell phone bill and knew that he was
    calling mom a lot. so last month, mom bought gary another cell phone. we can''t
    afford that! we struggle to pay our bills, and my sister and i have loaned mom
    money for her car insurance. mom has often expressed a fear of being alone. we
    are happy that she is feeling good about herself and dating again, but with gary,
    she''s headed for trouble. we don''t want her hurt. how can we help? -- worried

    i have been living with "adrian" for eight years -- and he still doesn''t want
    to commit to anything other than living together. i have tried explaining the
    issues of security, honor and respect, and the fact that i have proven i''m a
    worthy partner and deserve to be his wife. adrian is 45 and was married once.
    i am 39 and have been divorced twice. he uses my divorces as justification for
    not wanting to give up his independence. he recently bought a new home. it is
    solely in his name because i couldn''t afford to help with the closing costs or
    pay half the mortgage payment. i have a good job and contribute to all our bills.
    i am not looking for a free ride and have always been willing to pay my own way.
    after eight years, i do not have one joint bill nor do i own any thing with him
    jointly. when i try to discuss marriage with adrian, he becomes angry and verbally
    abusive. is this how you treat somebody you love? i feel i''m being punished for
    wanting a future with him. please give me some sound advice. -- wants respect

    what do you think of restaurants that have televisions in every room while you''re
    trying to eat dinner with your family? they make me crazy! i can''t stand them.
    i consider dinnertime to be a special opportunity for family members to share
    a nutritious meal while conversing about the events of everyone''s day. we don''t
    answer the phone or the doorbell, nor do we watch tv, so that we can concentrate
    on hearing about school and work. because during the rest of the day family members
    eat at different times and rush about, dinnertime is sacred. occasionally we dine
    out at different restaurants so that i can have a break from cooking and doing
    dishes. lately they all seem to have tvs in every room, and instead of talking,
    everyone stares at the tv like hypnotized zombies. if a baseball or football game
    is on, everything else is ignored. this defeats the purpose of having dinner out
    together. can anything be done to get the tvs removed from the dining areas in
    restaurants? shouldn''t there be a choice as to whether you eat in a room with
    a television or not? restaurants used to have small tv sets in the bar area, but
    not in the dining room. i hate to give up eating out, but i''m about ready to.
    any other suggestions? -- tv-less mom, south miami, fla.'

    every year you discuss practical gifts for senior citizens. when my late second
    cousin, "pat," turned 94, she was having serious problems with her vision. she
    loved corresponding with friends, but could no longer write in a straight line,
    so her envelopes could not be read correctly by the post office. i asked a friend
    if she would create some stationery that my cousin could use; she removed the
    thread from her sewing machine, and on the back of each sheet of paper "stitched"
    parallel lines about 1/2 inch apart. i asked her to do the same with the envelopes,
    but to make only four lines where the address would go. cousin pat loved her beautiful
    -- and useful -- stationery. her friends were able to read her handwriting, and
    so could the u.s. postal service. it''s easy to write in a straight line when
    your fingers can feel the tiny "bumps" that the needle makes. i''m a retired former
    braille teacher, and machine-stitching is one of the techniques i would use to
    make geometry drawings for blind students. (i wonder if banks would permit this
    on personal checks?) i hope this idea will help more people with fading eyesight
    to keep in touch. -- norma l. schecter, huntington beach, calif.'

    take it slow and not to pressure her. my son and lindy spend a lot of time alone
    together, and i worry about what might happen. now, having found these "toys,"
    i''m confused. i threw them away and left him a note where he''d hidden the toys,
    saying that these things are unnecessary, especially for an 18-year-old -- and
    besides, they aren''t the real thing. there were toys for both sexes, so that
    leads me to believe that lindy may use them also. (they looked quite new.) i want
    to believe that if they aren''t sexually active, drew feels these are necessary.
    i know all teenagers are curious, but i didn''t think the curiosity would advance
    past men''s magazines. was i wrong for being upset and throwing his toys away?

    "bill," on his international business trips. at the time, bill earned a very high
    salary. since then, bill has been laid off and has taken an early retirement.
    he now putters around the house, painting the shutters, working in the yard and
    thoroughly enjoying himself. this is not the life i expected, and i am becoming
    increasingly depressed. i was never much of a housewife and wouldn''t have left
    my job had i known this would be the outcome. i have a part-time job in a dress
    shop, but it''s hardly a challenging career. i want to travel. i want to have
    fun. we have a net worth in excess of $1 million, but bill has always been concerned
    about our finances and wants to manage them so that we can set up college funds
    for our grandchildren, leave a substantial amount to our children, and budget
    $7,500 a year for vacations, including trips to visit family. this doesn''t leave
    much. if i tell my husband how i feel it will hurt him terribly. what should i
    do? -- reluctantly retired in illinois'

    our 32-year-old daughter was raised in a home with traditional values. she was
    excited when she got engaged last february to the fellow she was living with.
    we began making wedding plans. her interest in the wedding began to wane. on a
    recent visit she stated that a marriage certificate was just a piece of paper,
    and they don''t need to be married to be committed to each other or to have children.
    her fiance told us that giving their children love would be enough. we don''t
    understand why she changed her mind about marriage in such a short period of time.
    they are talking about having children, so please answer soon. what can we say

  body: 'dear readers: today is thanksgiving, the time we pause to consider the blessings
    for which we have to be thankful. in many homes across the country turkeys are
    being stuffed, just as the people who consume them will be later in the day. but
    for many individuals, these holidays can be an intensely difficult time, triggering
    feelings of stress, loneliness and loss. if the person is prone to depression,
    these feelings can be further magnified. how can anyone feel depressed at this
    time of year, you ask? it''s not that far-fetched. people who are separated from
    their families often feel isolated because they can''t celebrate in the traditional
    way. families who have lost a loved one during the year often feel the absence
    especially keenly at this time. others become depressed because they imagine that
    everyone else is enjoying a warm, idealized family experience, while they are
    on the outside looking in. even people who enjoy the holidays can find them stressful.
    this is a time of year when people are stretched for time, energy and money --
    particularly the latter. they may become embarrassed because they can''t celebrate
    the way they would like to, or in the style they have in years past. some ways
    to ward off the holiday blues: keep expectations reasonable. don''t take on more
    activities than you can handle -- financially or otherwise. don''t overspend.
    plan a holiday budget and live within it -- regardless of the temptation. do not
    run up credit card debt, or january will be like a serious hangover. and speaking
    of hangovers -- watch your alcohol intake. remember, although alcohol seems to
    be a mood elevator, it is actually a depressant. if you have a problem with alcohol,
    get whatever support you need to make it through the holidays. a final thought:
    if you''re feeling down and want an instant "upper," the surest way to accomplish
    it is to do something nice for someone else. call someone who lives alone and
    invite that person to dinner. better yet, say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll
    see that you get safely home." (some older people don''t drive at night, and those
    who do might prefer not to be behind the wheel after dark.) give it a try! you''ll
    be glad you did. and now, i''ll repeat the thanksgiving prayer that was penned
    by my mother years ago. my thanksgiving would not be complete without it: o, heavenly
    father, we thank thee for food and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health
    and remember the sick. we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless.
    we thank thee for freedom and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir
    us to service. that thy gifts to us may be used for others. amen. p.s. we have
    much for which to be grateful this thanksgiving day. for those of you with a little
    time to spare, how about showing our gratitude to veterans by visiting a veterans
    hospital and raising the spirits of those who have served our country? happy thanksgiving,
    everyone! -- love, abby'

    i am a 34-year-old married woman with an adorable 8-year-old stepson, "cody,"
    who lives with his father and me. cody''s mother, "heather," left five years ago.
    shortly after that, i met and immediately fell in love with my ready-made family.
    i cannot have children of my own. heather''s mistake of leaving her husband and
    child became my "miracle." i was willing to do anything to make my family work.
    there was so much hostility between my husband and heather that they could barely
    converse without it becoming a yelling match. now, four years later, my husband,
    stepson and i have a civil relationship with heather. although cody lives with
    us, his mother has him every other weekend. (we live in the same town.) heather
    and i are both active in cody''s school activities, and we share the responsibility
    of taking him to doctor and dentist appointments (sometimes together). we have
    been applauded by cody''s teachers for being so supportive of our little boy.
    recently heather has begun confiding in me about her personal problems. she has
    a good job, pays no child support, so i''m not sure why she''s as broke as she
    claims. listening to her money woes makes me extremely uncomfortable, but i''m
    afraid if i say so, it could cause conflict all over again. that''s the last thing
    i want after trying so hard to get us all to be a family unit for cody''s sake.

    10 years, but the last six have been miserable. josh refuses to work on a regular
    basis. he''s a compulsive liar who looks me right in the eye and lies with conviction.

    would you please forward my letter to a very good friend of mine? i have never
    met this remarkable woman, but she has been a big part of my life for a couple
    of years. i met her through your column. her name is "heartbroken sister." i recently
    celebrated my first year of abstinence from tobacco. she was my inspiration. had
    it not been for her letter, i would never have been able to stop. like "heartbroken''s"
    sister, i, too, am in my early 40s with small children. like her, i started smoking
    at 13. that letter broke my heart, but it also made me think about the importance
    of being responsible for my health. i know she was trying to get through to teenagers,
    but she wound up saving my life. her sister didn''t die in vain! please tell "heartbroken"
    that i love her and that she''s always in my heart and prayers. her letter remains
    posted on my refrigerator where i can see it every day as a reminder of her inspiration
    and love. -- lydia eldredge, pocatello, idaho'

    i am a freshman in college and live in a dorm with one roommate, "mary." mary
    has had a boyfriend for two years. i''ll call him "john." john goes to school
    a couple of hours away and visits mary on weekends once or twice a month. this
    usually isn''t a problem for me, as i can plan ahead to go home for the weekend,
    or go out with friends so mary and john can have the room to themselves for a
    few hours. yesterday, on short notice, mary told me that john was spending the
    night. i frantically tried to make plans to be "elsewhere," but nothing worked
    out. i told mary i''d camp out in our dorm lounge, but she said not to worry because
    john was dead-tired and wanted to go to sleep right away. after he arrived, i
    sat at my desk doing homework on my computer and listening to music with headphones
    while mary and john watched tv in bed. when i glanced over at them a half-hour
    later, they were having sex! i didn''t know what to do. i tried to ignore them
    and continue "studying," but it was very distracting to have my roommate and her
    boyfriend "going at it" 5 feet away. when i woke up this morning, they were doing
    it again! i pretended to be asleep until they went to breakfast. mary has never
    done anything to embarrass me before. talking about the incident would make me
    extremely uncomfortable, but i know something needs to be said before john visits
    again. should i talk to mary -- or just pretend this nightmare didn''t happen?

    twenty-five years ago, my husband and i hired a 16-year-old girl, "susan," as
    a "mother''s helper" for the summer. she watched our children while my husband,
    "drew," and i worked. once in a while susan would spend the night. on one of those
    nights, drew raped susan and she became pregnant. charges were not filed, and
    drew begged my forgiveness. drew paid for susan''s medical expenses and she was
    sent away to a maternity home. the baby was adopted. we never knew whether the
    child was a boy or a girl. we moved 800 miles away to get over the shame, and
    after a lot of hard work, we repaired our marriage. we never told our children
    about susan and their father. last week, drew received a special delivery letter
    from his birth daughter. she wants to meet him and ask him some questions. she
    has already met susan, who did not tell her about the rape. susan told her she
    was the result of a "relationship that didn''t work out." abby, should drew refuse
    to meet her? should he tell her the truth? should we tell our grown children?
    we need your help. -- pain revisited in california'

    three years ago, a friend of mine gave me your "keepers" booklet. i enjoyed it
    very much. one of my favorite pieces was the poem about guest towels. (my mother
    always put out lovely guest towels, but few people ever used them.) i would like
    to order a copy of "keepers" for a friend who is going through a difficult time.
    i know the holidays will be depressing for her. i think it would inspire her and
    perhaps give her a lift. the ordering information i have is: "send a self-addressed
    envelope, plus a check or money order for $5 (u.s. funds) for each copy to: dear

    a close friend of mine -- i''ll call her jane -- is a thief. (she is 15 and i

    howard doesn''t mind. my problem is, i don''t think i''m in love with howard.
    he has an extremely low sex drive. we haven''t been intimate in years. in fact,
    out of frustration, i moved out of the bedroom last year. i have tried talking
    to him about our problem to no avail. he refuses to go to counseling. to complicate
    matters, three years ago i began an affair with a married man. although he and
    his wife have children, they are divorcing. we want to be together, but i don''t
    know if i can leave howard. my lover earns less than half of what howard makes,
    plus he will have to pay child support. i don''t know if i can manage on his salary.
    please understand, i don''t work because i don''t want to put my kids in day care.
    as i see it, i have three choices: (1) continue the affair and hope nobody finds
    out. (2) leave howard and hope my lover and i can make it on his small salary.
    (3) end the affair. if we end the affair, i think one of us would have to move.

    he asked how i knew what a belt sounds like when it hits skin, i told him that
    i was abused as a child. for 13 years i was beaten almost daily. no one ever came

    can''t stand up to an adult who beats them. help is available -- and it''s just

    may i respond to "sad mom," who gave her 27-year-old daughter the wrong advice
    about going through with her marriage? as a pastor, i take marriage seriously.
    when a couple asks me to perform their ceremony, i make it clear i believe that
    marriage is for life. each time i meet with a couple, i ask if they still want
    to go through with the ceremony, and i tell them that if there is any doubt at
    all, we can "postpone" it. i would rather have them call it off now than one year,
    10 years or even 50 years down the road. i also inform the couple that on the
    day of the ceremony i will ask if they want to go through with it, and if for
    any reason they wish to call it off, it is perfectly ok. it is their future, not

    and i need. i am now looking for work, along with thousands of other people. my
    problem is, i have a criminal record that stems from two small but painful incidents
    when i was 18. my husband knows about my record, but no one else does. when going
    on job interviews, i have been honest and up-front about my past, but it seems
    i''m put on the "ignore list" once the interviewer hears about my record. they
    can''t see the years that have passed without so much as a traffic ticket; how
    i solved my problem through therapy; the stable environment my husband and i provide
    for our boys; nor the years of hard work i devoted to my previous job and current
    business. how can i find someone who will hire me while my growing business takes
    off? should i lie about my record? i know it''s hard to trust a stranger, but
    i''m a hard worker, an honest and faithful employee -- and i am desperate. --

    i am realistic. i accept the fact that i won''t be going to an ivy league school.

    can you imagine waking to the sound of your smoke alarm in the middle of the night?
    would you know what to do? half of all home fires occur between 10:00 p.m. and
    6:00 a.m. -- when most people are sound asleep. this year the national fire protection
    association (nfpa), the official sponsor of fire protection week for more than
    80 years, has teamed with pella windows and doors and the home safety council
    to promote fire safety education and preparedness during fire prevention week,
    oct. 5-11, 2003. our theme: "when fire strikes, get out! stay out!" our campaign
    drives home the message that when the smoke alarm goes off, you should leave right
    away using one of your two preplanned escape routes -- and not go back inside
    for any reason. abby, please let parents know that as part of their escape plan,
    they must make sure that smoke alarms wake everyone in the home, especially children.
    if family members do not wake to the sound of the alarm, consider installing interconnected
    smoke alarms in all the bedrooms. when one alarm sounds, they all sound. or assign
    an adult to take the sound sleepers and assist them in escaping. thank you for
    sharing this important information with your readers. -- james m. shannon, president,

    years before we met, my husband, "phil," had a relationship with a married woman
    i''ll call trish. it began before we met and ended when our relationship began.
    phil and trish believe that her first child is his. for the first seven years
    of this child''s life, phil watched the child from afar and continued having relations
    with trish. her husband has no clue. i told phil i wanted nothing to do with this

    it never happened. but since he terminated his relationship with trish, i really
    couldn''t complain. trish has continued to e-mail and call phil attempting to
    arrange a dinner for the two of them so they can catch up, and he could be kept
    informed of the child''s development. (he is now 13.) i told phil i would entertain
    the idea if trish''s husband and i were included. he said that was impossible.
    last night, phil received an e-mail from trish stating that he had promised he
    would "always be there" for her -- and now he isn''t. phil didn''t respond. i

    see her "on the side." yvette said she hadn''t talked to him for more than seven

    i needed the information to invite him "and his wife" to a party. the receptionist

    my wife, "denise," and i have been together for 21 years; married for 11. when
    we first moved in together, we lived in a studio apartment. her parents would
    visit us twice a year and never hesitated to make themselves at home in our cramped
    space. they even slept in our bed. now that we have a house and kids, my in-laws
    visit for at least a month twice a year. denise says i treat them "badly" because
    i don''t talk to them much. well, i don''t have anything in common with those
    people. i''ve tried to tell denise that the length of time her parents are underfoot
    is way too long for me, and that i''d never impose on anyone like that -- but
    she insists that because her parents live 1,500 miles away, it "wouldn''t make
    sense" for them to cut their visits short. this situation has taken its toll on
    me, abby. it has also caused marital problems. i have tried to reason with denise,
    but she won''t budge -- and now she''s giving me the silent treatment. i think
    her mother is in on it, too. all i ask for is a little common sense and courtesy.
    i''ve spoken to a number of friends and family members. they think i''m nuts for
    having allowed this scenario to repeat itself year after year. i think visitors
    are like fish -- they start to stink after a number of days. what do you think,

    my 7-year-old, "richie," attended a birthday party today. pizza and cake were
    served, and goodie bags were handed out at the door as the kids left. in the car,
    on the way home, richie opened his and found inside a thank-you note from the
    birthday boy which read, "thanks for coming to my party and thanks for the great

    he didn''t open his presents during the party. how could he know what i gave him
    was great?" after my kids'' parties, we sit down together and write an individual
    thank-you card for each gift, and in it my son mentions the particular present.
    sometimes we even enclose a photo of the child taken at the party. in the past,
    we have received e-mail thank-yous, but never one in a goodie bag sent home the

    was shocked and offended, but didn''t tell my husband until we left a few minutes
    later. we have had a problem in the past with ralph. once when i was nursing,
    he sat close to me and stared at my chest. my husband said, "there''s only enough
    room for one head, dad." immediately afterward, i spoke to doris and the peeping
    stopped. the nursing thing was weird, but this goes way beyond that. i like and
    respect ralph for the most part, but i don''t know what to do. we go to my in-laws''
    every other weekend. i can''t go over there and pretend nothing happened. my husband
    wants to talk to his father alone, but i feel ralph needs to account to someone
    other than his son -- he should also account to doris. is this taking it too far?

    my ex-wife and i divorced after 29 years. both of us made a mess of our marriage.
    three years of marriage counseling couldn''t undo the infidelity and multiple
    personal problems we had accumulated. there is still a deep reservoir of hurt
    and anger over those years, but both of us have moved on with other relationships.
    the problem is for the past 16 years, my daughter, "lili," has lived with her
    mother, who apparently filled her head with all of my transgressions. lili refuses
    to have anything to do with me. nothing i did was any worse than what her mother
    did -- but, of course, lili wasn''t hearing that side of the story. my sons and
    i get along well. they seem to understand that neither of their parents was an
    angel. they accept my ex and me, warts and all. even though we live 3,000 miles
    apart, i send my daughter birthday cards, gifts for her birthday, christmas and
    valentine''s day, etc. she ignores me -- and the silence hurts. i don''t deserve
    this kind of treatment. should i continue trying to reach out to her? or should
    i just forget i have a daughter? sixteen years of a one-way relationship is heartbreaking.

    i have been widowed for five years. my neighbor, "matt," lost his second wife
    three years ago. we are both in our 60s and have been friendly for two years.
    matt seems convinced that every woman who is nice to him has marriage on her mind.
    i don''t want to remarry -- and he knows it -- but it doesn''t seem to matter.
    he has been in my home numerous times, but nothing comes of it. he seems shy,
    and i know he is lonely, but he doesn''t seem interested in an intimate relationship.
    matt is a wonderful man. i know he and i could be closer if he would just open
    up a little. people need people, abby. what do you suggest? -- people person in

    my husband, "jack," grew up with an emotionally abusive mother. he''s had limited

    with terminal cancer and given less than a year to live. jack has tried to let
    go of his past anger in order to emotionally support her and spend quality time

    my husband, "bob," and i were married in las vegas. it was a second marriage for
    both of us. we had planned on a small, quiet wedding with only his brother and
    sister-in-law as witnesses. without consulting bob or me, his sister-in-law "surprised"
    us by upgrading our hotel room to a suite that adjoined theirs. in addition, she
    invited several surprise guests -- one of whom was "anna," my husband''s former
    high school sweetheart. (she had been a foreign exchange student from germany
    and happened to be visiting the u.s. at the time.) anna has been married for many
    years and has two grown sons. i had always known that bob''s family was fond of
    her and had remained in touch over the years. they even visited anna and her family
    in europe twice. i did my best not to overreact, but anna''s surprise appearance
    completely ruined my wedding -- not to mention the honeymoon. (my husband and
    i hardly had a minute to ourselves.) we have now been married three years. bob
    adopted my little boy and is a wonderful husband and father. i feel truly blessed
    to have such a happy home. the problem? anna is once again planning a trip to
    the u.s. to see bob and the family. i see red every time i hear them singing her
    praises. (not since mother teresa has there been such a saint!) i am filled with
    anger and dread over her impending visit and cannot imagine how i''ll get through
    it. bob knows how i feel. he says he loves me and there''s absolutely nothing
    to worry about. am i being unreasonable -- or is this an unreasonable situation?

    ago, and from the day i walked in and saw my boss, i knew he and i were meant
    to be together. we began an intense physical relationship two weeks after i was
    hired. we had lunch and talked on the phone every day. then suddenly, about a
    month later, he stopped having anything to do with me personally and started keeping
    his distance at work. i still believed with all my heart that he was the man for
    me. i waited and waited. i knew he would come back to me -- and after six months
    he did! for the last four months he has been showering me with attention. i am
    completely in love with this man, but there are days at work when he doesn''t
    speak to me. he contends that all is still good between us. i am an attractive

    i have been dating "harold" for two and a half years. we are in love and things
    were great until a year ago, when a friend informed me that harold is married
    and the father of three children. when i asked him if it was true, he confessed
    that yes, he is married, but he''s not "in love" with his wife and they are getting
    a divorce. they have not lived together in the time we''ve been dating; he has
    a separate apartment -- and their divorce will be final soon. my problem is harold
    still doesn''t want me to meet his children. he says he doesn''t want to upset
    them and isn''t sure how they''ll react to me. they are 16, 8 and 5. i''m attractive,
    well-educated and hard-working. i only want what is best for their dad. i feel
    i should meet his children. they are an important part of his life and he adores
    them. i have met many of his friends and some of his family. is it unreasonable
    for me to expect to be introduced to his kids? i bring the subject up occasionally,
    but it upsets him. he says i need to "give him time." i''m beginning to think
    his children will never be happy at the thought of their father being with a woman
    other than their mother, and i''m beginning to doubt harold''s sincerity. what

    the recent letter from the woman who was seated next to a man who talked on his

    experience. recently, my college-aged daughter and i were in a grocery store.
    a woman was walking down the aisle with her cell phone stuck to her ear. she was
    gossiping in a loud voice and using first and last names. after two aisles of
    this, my daughter said to the woman, "excuse me. i know so-and-so. shall i tell
    her how you feel about what happened?" the woman was visibly flustered. she ended
    the call, telling her "cell mate" she''d call her when she got home. after we
    left the store, i asked my daughter how she knew the person. my daughter said
    she didn''t. but she wanted the woman to realize that she was being overheard

    that grandma was "cursing" us from the grave for disobeying her wishes. he has
    ordered me to give the silverware back to julie. i think this is nonsense. to
    suggest that my sweet grandmother would send my 14-year-old nephew severe health
    problems from "beyond the grave" is a vile thing to say about a woman who loved
    us all very much. i am scheduled for major surgery in a few weeks (further proof
    of the curse, according to dad). should i return the silverware to julie, even
    though i don''t believe in curses, or should i just ignore the "curse" and take
    the consequences? please don''t tell me to see a priest. we''re jewish. -- "cursed"

    when you receive a gift on a special occasion and it''s obvious that it''s an
    envelope with a check inside, should the envelope be opened in front of the person
    or should it be tucked away to open privately? i always worry that if i open the
    envelope in front of the giver, it''s as though i am checking the amount. on the

    i read with interest your suggestions to "young lady who needs to know in memphis,"
    who asked what important questions should be asked before marriage to ensure a
    happy union. you listed such subjects as monogamy, emotional and financial independence,
    child-rearing and discipline, compatible career goals, sex, religion and politics.
    i agree with those recommendations, but i think someone should ask: have you had
    previous sexual experience? if the answer is no, this is important information.
    if the answer is yes, further discussion regarding safe sex, hiv testing, birth
    control, etc., should ensue, which may also prompt another important question:

    children i could work from home. it''s now five years later. howie has taken the
    mcats (medical college admission tests) but scores poorly because he never takes
    the time to study or take the preparatory classes. i''m frustrated, because he
    seems to want a different career every three months. he has talked about becoming
    a college professor and a biologist. but it is all talk and no action. i''m beginning
    to wonder if we''ll ever be financially secure enough to start a family. a couple
    of months ago, howie told me he was going to become a paramedic. last week he
    dropped another bomb -- he wants to join the army. i think it''s a mistake for
    anyone as indecisive as my husband to join the military because he won''t be able
    to back out when he changes his mind in three months. he claims he has "always"

    years i have known him. i wish howie had told me this was his life goal when we

    i recently graduated from high school and will attend college in the fall. i will

    my husband and i were married several weeks ago in a beautiful, reverent, christian
    ceremony. our reception, held in an upscale restaurant, was designed to be both
    fun and tasteful. everything from the dance music to the cake-cutting was planned
    to represent the love and respect we had for each other on our first day of wedded
    life. that spirit was shattered by "simone," my husband''s brother''s girlfriend.
    she took over our reception. her shrill voice screamed at least 50 times for my
    husband and me to kiss and smear cake in each other''s faces. she drank champagne
    straight from the bottle. she showed our guests x-rated photographs of her unmarried
    daughter''s natural childbirth. she performed a "striptease" by whipping her skirt
    over her head and gyrating against other guests in a practically nonexistent thong.
    we didn''t realize the extent of her misbehavior until we returned from our honeymoon
    and saw the video. the expression on the faces of our guests is horrified, and
    she dominates every scene. simone will no doubt be a permanent fixture in my husband''s
    family. i do not want to cause a rift, but that vulgar woman ruined my wedding.

    and have never told him how i feel. however, a little incident recently made it
    pretty clear he feels the same way i do. no, it''s not what you''re thinking.
    we simply shared a "moment" (corny as it sounds). it was like in the movies when
    the music soars, the man and woman suddenly lock eyes and slowly move in for "the

    four years ago, i hired a woman to help me with household chores i could no longer
    handle. (i am 83 and in poor health.) "nelly" came for two hours every other week
    and was a great help. she started out at $10 an hour, and last year she requested
    her hourly rate be raised to $12.50. i obliged. during nelly''s visits, i learned
    about her family: a "macho" husband who showed her little respect; a daughter
    with a jailbird boyfriend and a pack of kids; and several brothers who cheated
    her out of her inheritance from her parents. i liked nelly and i felt sorry enough
    for her to consider leaving her a bequest in my will. it was my way of saying
    thank you beyond what i paid her. a few weeks ago, i noticed some jewelry and
    $150 in cash were missing from my bureau. among the missing items were two rings
    that had been given to me by my late husband. they were of great sentimental value
    to me. no one other than nelly and i had been in my bedroom. i suppose the temptation
    was too much. finally i asked her if she''d seen the missing items. she claimed
    she hadn''t. however, the next evening she called and said that her husband no
    longer wanted her to work for me because she was "needed at home." should i confront
    her and demand that my jewelry and money be returned? nelly cleans for other folks
    i know, and perhaps they need to be warned. -- puzzled and angry in oklahoma'

    like "smiling through the pain," i, too, suffer from chronic pain. when my doctor
    told me that there were no medications at this time that would make the pain go
    away, i asked, "how am i going to endure this?" she replied, "live one day at
    a time. live each day to the fullest. laugh heartily, love deeply, pray daily
    -- and let the rest roll off." i then asked, "how am i going to live with the
    pain?" she said, "surround yourself with positive things -- positive people, sunshine,
    rainbows, roses, puppies and kittens." after reflecting upon what she had said,
    i realized that this is a great prescription for anyone''s life. that doctor probably
    saved mine. not only did she give my monstrous disease a name, she helped me to
    make my life worth living again. i have good days and bad. i curse the bad ones
    and praise god for the good ones. the "good" pain comes when i have accomplished
    what i wanted to do that day. the "bad" pain comes when i refrain from doing what
    i want to do -- and hurt anyway. every day i get up, get dressed and have something
    planned to do. and, abby, i try to perform at least one act of kindness for someone
    each day. regardless of my pain, it makes each day seem fuller. i hope you will
    find this letter appropriate to share with your readers. if it helps someone else
    who is hurting (for whatever reason), then my effort will not have been in vain.

    "graciela in brazil" said she has been dating a young man for only a month, and
    that he is pushing so hard for an exclusive relationship that she "sometimes feels
    suffocated." you advised that his behavior is one of the warning signs of an abuser.
    about 10 years ago, i met a woman who is now my ex-wife. i "overlooked" the fact
    that she initially lied to me about the fact she was married. she left her "controlling"
    husband, and we entered into an immediate sexual and exclusive relationship (i
    slept with her the night we met). on a scale of one to 10, our passion level was
    about a 12. after three months, she pushed for marriage and i went along. she
    said, "let''s set a wedding date," even though she didn''t know when her divorce
    would be final. the next time we were shopping, she suggested buying our wedding
    bands so we would have them when the time came. in spite of the fact i felt things
    were moving too quickly, i went along with everything because i didn''t want to
    be perceived as noncommittal -- and our passion was boundless. we were married
    five days after her divorce was final, even though we''d had some heavy-duty arguments
    during the 10 months we dated. those arguments stemmed from one issue: she felt
    threatened by my past relationships. i couldn''t convince her that i had absolutely
    no contact with any of my former girlfriends. if there was a hang-up on my answering
    machine, she suspected an old girlfriend was trying to contact me. i believe,
    in retrospect, if her first husband was controlling, she saw in me someone she
    could control. i had sent her that message loud and clear when i let slide her
    lying to me about her marital status when we met. i know all of this is water
    over the dam, but i''m curious. am i off base in believing she was a controlling

    several times over the past month while i was dropping off or picking up my son
    from preschool, i observed a mother of one of the other preschoolers leaving her
    infant alone in her vehicle with the engine running while she went inside the
    school to retrieve her other child. at times, the woman was away from her van
    for at least five minutes. rather than confront the mother with my concern, i
    stopped by our local police department to ask if there are any laws against this.
    i was hoping an information flier was available that i could share with her, but
    there was not. an officer asked me to describe the woman''s vehicle and the approximate
    time of day she came to the school. evidently, the police officer mentioned to
    the mother that "another mother" had notified them about her. now she and several
    other parents in our preschool are upset. a friend in whom i confided that the
    "other mother" was me, told me i should have minded my own business! (she, too,

    "trying to keep the peace in the pacific northwest" wants a simple wedding, but
    doesn''t want to alienate his or his fiancee''s large families. i have seven sisters,
    a brother, several stepparents, a huge extended family and a large circle of friends.
    (and that is just on my side!) my fiance and i could not afford a big wedding
    or a fancy reception, so here''s how we handled it: we made a list of what was
    really important to us. i love lots of fresh flowers, so that was put on the "splurge"
    list. my fiance enjoys good champagne. everything else we either made or asked
    friends to help with. my mom made my dress; a friend who was handy with a camera
    took the photos; we were married in the garden of my ex-roommate''s large home;
    my husband made his own d.j. tapes by recording songs off the radio; and i asked
    each of my female friends to bring a plate of hors d''oeuvres. everyone knew our
    financial situation. no one was offended. on the contrary, we were told repeatedly
    how happy they were to contribute. one hundred and fifty people attended our wedding
    and everyone agreed it was one of the best times they ever had. the cost? $1,500.
    twenty-one years later, we are still madly in love and have not changed our priorities.
    ironically, we have friends who were still paying off their wedding debt while
    ironing out their divorce settlements. "trying" is a wise young man whose priorities
    are in order. no one should be pressured into spending what he or she doesn''t
    have to begin with. -- happy in huntington beach, calif.'

    after going together for more than a year, my boyfriend, "hank," and i rented
    an apartment and moved in together. while we were unpacking, hank showed me a
    charcoal portrait of his ex-girlfriend wearing only a garter belt and stockings,
    standing behind a strategically placed tree branch. hank told me he''s having
    it custom-framed to hang in our living room. when i protested, he told me it was
    a gift and he felt obligated to display it. (i want to burn it!) i''ve given hank
    stacks of photos of myself since we''ve met, and he hasn''t framed a single one.
    how should i handle this? -- wants to turn the charcoal into ashes'

    i love my husband very much. "gary" and i have been together for 11 years. however,
    he seems to be less and less interested in me. we no longer spend time alone together.
    gary works long hours, so it''s rare when we share a meal together. every night
    before he comes home from his shift, he stops at the local diner and sits with
    his friends for an hour or so. when we do go out, gary insists we patronize this
    same diner, so his buddies can sit and join us. recently, my husband had surgery.
    it has temporarily limited his physical activities. he claims to be in too much
    pain to do anything -- or go anywhere -- with me. but if one of his diner buddies
    invites him to go somewhere, he''s up and out of the house in a heartbeat. abby,

    them all. i made clear to everyone who else i was inviting so they had the option

    our family recently attended my daughter''s high school graduation. seated next
    to us was a couple who talked to each other during the entire commencement --
    until the man''s cell phone began ringing. then he continued to carry on a loud
    conversation over the phone. needless to say, it was a major distraction for all
    of us who were seated near him. this is not the first time such a thing has happened,
    and i know it won''t be the last. people who talk while others are trying to listen
    do not seem to care that they''re disruptive and disrespectful. this happens everywhere
    nowadays -- church, business meetings, movies and plays. growing up, i was taught
    to listen with respect and never interrupt others. i have tried to politely ask
    the offender to "keep it down," or have gotten up and moved to a quieter location,
    but sometimes it''s impossible. has our society gotten so "me-oriented" that we''ve

    last saturday afternoon, i attended a cousin''s baby shower hosted by our "aunt
    flo." it was held at a local restaurant, and flo provided the cake and decorations.
    the guests were expected to pay for their own meals and drinks. the invitation
    revealed nothing about this arrangement. those of us attending didn''t find out
    until we called to rsvp. it seems unfair to burden guests with this cost, when
    they are also paying for a baby gift -- not to mention travel expenses for those

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    we recently learned that our daughter was molested at a very early age in the
    1970s. it went on for nearly a year. we never realized how profoundly molestation
    affects a child. i had heard it was an awful thing, but i never knew the secrecy,
    the pain, the shame, the guilt, and how the victims are groomed by their predators.
    they live in a secret world by themselves -- brokenhearted, in loneliness and
    fear. they try to run faster than their pain -- and some don''t know why because
    it has been blocked from their memory. i have heard that four out of 10 women
    have been molested as children. this is a huge number. there are plenty of victims,
    but guess what? no predators! they are all "innocent," and protected by families
    who hide it because they don''t know how to handle the problem. they are protected
    by a gray area of "uncertainty." it remains that way because the authorities are
    never called to investigate. the parents of the molested child are threatened
    with a nasty lawsuit. then the whole family turns against the parents and the
    victim in order to protect the "sick" one and their own reputations. everyone
    -- individually and collectively -- sticks their head in the sand and refuses
    to deal with it. statutes of limitations run out. an unbelievable amount of pressure
    is put on the parents by the family. then it is dismissed because "it happened
    a long time ago." meanwhile, as the years pass, the victim becomes progressively
    more mentally, physically and emotionally sick. she''s in and out of hospitals
    and always on medication. because now the victim has been rejected and betrayed
    all over again. if he is "innocent," then she must be "guilty" by default, which
    reinforces what he told her as a child -- that it was all her fault to begin with.
    the burden placed on her shoulders becomes unbearable. and the closer the extended
    family, the more profound the rejection. her worst nightmare has come true. finally,
    she becomes so physically sick and unnerved that she has a breakdown. she has
    a hard time finding where "she" is inside herself. the medicines she must take
    are depressants themselves. abby, we struggle every day. i know of four other
    families where similar molestation, rejection and denial have occurred. families
    should wake up to the problem. it''s time to bring it out of the closet. i hope
    you will print some of this letter. i sign for her ... i do have a face, i do
    have a name, every city, u.s.a.'

    out of the blue, he said he didn''t want to see me anymore and ordered me out

    left immediately. the day after ted''s blowup, i talked to him on the phone and
    his anger was gone. he explained that he needed his space, and i accepted it.
    the following day we talked again, and i could hear the anger was back in his
    voice. the day after that, he was as sweet as he''s ever been. we tearfully discussed
    breaking up, but remaining friends. i would like nothing more than for ted to
    enjoy his "space" and discover that i really am the one for him. but i love him,
    and this is the hardest thing i have dealt with in our two years of ups and downs.
    until three months ago, ted was a drug user. now i wonder if he''s using again.

    drugs than i ever thought possible. but my love for him has endured. when ted

    i''m an attractive 18-year-old single female from a good family. i enjoy wonderful
    friendships and am about to begin my first year of college. i was wondering if
    you could figure out what my problem is, because nobody else can. whenever i like
    a guy, i make it clear with friendly, "interested" actions. (but believe me, i''m
    not too forward.) at first, guys seem to like me, too. but then they quickly become

    i am a 20-year-old male and a full-time college student. on nights and weekends
    i hold down two part-time jobs. one of them is delivering pizza. one night two
    weeks ago, i made a delivery to a nearby motel. as i was leaving, i saw a familiar
    car pull into the parking lot. it was my mother''s mustang. she was driving. i
    was surprised to see her there, so i turned my car around and followed her to
    the rear of the motel. i watched her park, get out, knock on a door and enter.
    after several minutes of confusion, i returned to my job. two hours later, after
    more deliveries, i returned to the motel. sure enough, her car was still parked
    in the same spot. after 20 minutes or so, i watched her come out of a room with
    a man i recognized from her office. he''s in his late 20s, and i know he has a
    wife and two small children. (mother is 41, but looks younger.) i froze. i didn''t
    confront her. now i don''t know what to do. every time i look at my dad i feel

    my husband, "howard," and i are in our early 40s with two young children. i have
    had a problem with my father-in-law my entire marriage. he expects howard to entertain
    him on weekends. as it is, they see each other monday through friday because they
    work together. my father-in-law is married, but he doesn''t want to be home with
    his wife on weekends -- he''d rather spend time fishing or bowling with his son.
    i think howard should be with our children and me on the weekends. when i complain
    to him about it, howard accuses me of nagging. this saturday morning when i objected,
    howard stalked out and said over his shoulder, "see you tonight!" it''s impossible
    to make plans for the weekends because howard won''t agree to anything until he
    checks with his dad first to see if he wants to do something. am i selfish to
    want my husband''s attention for our children and me on weekends? after all, his
    dad already sees him far more than we do. should i try to accept this, or tell

    after a six-year relationship with my boyfriend, "rudy," i have learned that he''s
    been shacking-up with another woman. i am devastated. i was sometimes suspicious
    about rudy''s living situation. he told me he was renting a room from his longtime
    friend, "lorna," but i was never invited in. rudy''s explanation was that since
    it wasn''t his home, he didn''t feel comfortable having company. you guessed it,
    abby. lorna, the "longtime friend," turned out to be my rudy''s lover. the way
    i found out was humiliating. last sunday, i dropped by to visit him because he
    had told me on the phone the night before that he had stomach flu. when i rang
    the doorbell, an older man opened the door and identified himself as lorna''s
    father. when i asked if i could come in and see rudy, the old man told me that
    lorna and rudy were away on a caribbean cruise. my jaw dropped. when i introduced
    myself as rudy''s girlfriend, and my 15-month-old as rudy''s child, his jaw dropped.
    how could the man i love, the father of our precious baby, have pulled off this
    double life? i''m hurt and angry, but i know i must pull myself together for my
    daughter. how will i control myself when that two-timer has the nerve to show

    my wife, "ruthie," and i have been together for 10 years and married for five.
    we have three beautiful children. last year, i caught ruthie having an affair,
    but i eventually forgave her. to this day, every time my wife leaves the house,
    i can''t help asking her who she''s meeting, where she''ll be, what time i can
    expect her home -- and if she''s going to cheat on me again. every once in a while,
    i still find strange phone numbers in her pocket or purse. when i call, the men
    always say they didn''t know ruthie was married. then they quickly break it off
    with her. abby, i want my marriage to last. i love my wife with all my heart.
    what can i do to make my marriage to ruthie better? -- kentucky husband'

    the summer travel season has officially begun. the criminals are prepared; are
    your readers? according to the fbi''s uniform crime reporting program (2000),
    the greatest number of burglaries occurs in july and august -- and 60 percent
    of all residential burglaries occur during the daytime. the home safety council
    recommends simple safeguards that will reduce the chances of being victimized:
    (1) evaluate your home''s security. do all door and window locks work? (2) is
    outside lighting bright and focused to illuminate potential entry points? (3)
    are hedges and trees trimmed so intruders can''t use them for cover? (4) have
    you removed any extra keys that you''ve hidden outside? (burglars know all the
    good hiding places.) (5) make your home look "lived in" while you''re away. buy
    timers to set lights to come on at different times. (6) ask a neighbor to park
    in your driveway while you''re gone. (7) stop newspaper and mail deliveries, or
    have someone pick them up daily. (8) do not invite trouble by changing your answering
    machine greeting to say you''re out of town on vacation. (9) provide a neighbor,
    relative or close friend with your itinerary and contact information so you can
    be reached in case of emergency. thanks for sharing this information with your
    readers, abby. -- meri-k appy, president, the home safety council'

    there has been a new arrival in our family and i have an important question. is
    it true that two brown-eyed, dark-haired people cannot be the parents of a blue-eyed,

    school. it has always been my understanding that a child carries not only the
    genes of his or her parents, but also the genes of grandparents, great-grandparents,

    i would like to comment on the letter from "fed up," the 13-year-old girl whose
    mother is bulimic and who is ridiculed in school by other kids because she is
    overweight. i was trained in another country to become a teacher. our psychology
    teacher explained to us that, since parents cannot be present in school to protect
    their children, it is therefore the teachers'' and the principal''s full responsibility
    to protect the students from physical and emotional abuse by other students. i
    am one of many educators who believe that it is the parents'' responsibility to
    discipline their children and teach them proper social conduct. that said, this
    is how i handle my responsibility: every year on the first day of school i present
    the rules of conduct in my class to the new students. i tell them that i expect
    everyone to behave and respect each other. i tell them that i am well aware that
    some children like to call names and hurt other children''s feelings, but i do
    not tolerate this kind of behavior. i say, "if anyone hits you or hurts your feelings
    -- tell me immediately." i will call the parents of the abusive student and tell
    them what their child did, and that i will not admit their child in my class the
    next day unless accompanied by one of his/her parents. i expect the parent to
    sit in our classroom the entire day and make sure that his/her child does not
    hurt anyone. i then ask the students, "how many of you think your mother or father
    will have the time to sit in our class the whole day?" no one raises a hand. no
    student ever dares to abuse another student in my class. i hope that child''s
    letter will cause people to think and change the discipline policies that exist
    in many u.s. schools -- and i hope that other caring teachers and principals will
    follow my psychology teacher''s instructions and prevent abusive students from
    hurting helpless students. -- retired teacher in atlanta'

    (i work days and she works the night shift.) unfortunately, joy''s manager, "vic,"
    has had his eye on her for some time. vic is married and nearly twice her age.
    i discovered e-mails they''d sent each other, which make clear that he is only

    then promised to cut him off. on the home front, things were better than ever
    until i found a new e-mail from vic that was "too hot to handle." when i called
    her on it, joy told me she loves me and wants to keep our family together, but
    i can see she is still infatuated with vic. i decided to take matters into my
    own hands. i contacted him directly and told him to lay off. now i''m getting

    i have a girlfriend at work i''ll call "crystal." i think she''s cheating with
    "john," a co-worker who is married. crystal was going to be married in the fall,
    but now the wedding is off. she says that she and john are "just friends." but
    the way it looks to me, they are a lot more than that. i see crystal and john
    in the parking lot after work. he sits in the driver''s seat, and she sticks half
    her body through the car window to kiss him goodbye. they also go "out to lunch"
    every day. when i ask her if she''d like to have lunch with me, she lies and says
    she''s staying in -- then i see them in the parking lot and she''s all over him.
    i''ve tried talking to crystal about john, but she gets defensive. i think he

    with a co-worker. how can i tell crystal she shouldn''t waste her time with a

    my fiancee, "charlene," and i plan to marry this fall. we couldn''t be happier
    and eagerly anticipate spending our lives together. however, the wedding planning
    is causing tension in our families. charlene and i are recent college grads, struggling
    to pay off student loans. we are unable to afford a large, lavish wedding. after
    discussing this at length, we realized that neither of us wanted a big wedding
    in the first place. we prefer a quiet, intimate gathering, and a small ceremony
    would suit us both. our problem is, charlene and i feel we must accommodate our
    large families who want to attend our wedding. we''re afraid that if we don''t
    invite everyone on both sides, feelings will be hurt. how do we arrange for the
    perfect small wedding of our dreams without disappointing our extended family

    when i was in college 10 years ago, i experienced my first intimate relationship
    one summer with another student, "bill." when the fall semester rolled around,
    i learned that my randomly selected roommate in the dorm was an ex-girlfriend
    of bill''s. i''ll call her april. i did not tell april about my relationship with
    bill because she was still getting over him. our romance continued for several
    weeks, but bill and i were careful to keep it from her. as the weeks went by,
    april and i became closer. i finally cut all ties with bill because of the loyalty
    i felt to my roommate. in the decade that followed graduation, i married and had
    a family. i lead a quiet life and i am content. a few days ago, i received a phone
    call out of the blue from april. to my astonishment, she informed me that after
    all these years, she and bill are back together and about to be married. she asked
    me to attend the wedding. i never came clean with april about my relationship
    with bill -- and i have no plans to. knowing him, he never breathed a word of
    it to her either. i still hold both my ex-roommate and my ex-boyfriend close to

    my live-in boyfriend, "larry," carpools with me to work every day. we enjoy the
    benefits of sharing the hour-long commute -- the money we save on gas and maintenance,
    the commuter incentives offered by our workplace and each other''s company. the
    one thing i don''t like is the fact that larry is constantly late every morning
    -- which in turn makes me late. it''s not as though he doesn''t have plenty of
    time to get ready. after i''ve finished showering and dressing, larry is still
    lying around in bed. once he''s up, he turns on the weather channel or checks
    his e-mail. by the time he finally showers and dresses, we''re already running
    late. (his supervisor doesn''t mind if he shows up around 10 a.m. however, i recently
    started a new job and am expected to be at my desk by 9 every morning.) i''ve
    tried everything i can think of to get larry to speed up his morning routine.
    i''ve joked, teased, nagged and begged. now i''ve reached the point where i just
    sit on the couch and glare at him until he''s ready to go. when i suggest we drive
    separately, he acts insulted. is there some magic trick to convince my boyfriend
    of the importance of punctuality -- or should i bite the bullet and insist on
    making the hour-long commute by myself? -- always tardy in southern california'

    i am a 26-year-old wife and mother of a 16-month-old son. for the most part, i
    feel blessed. however, there are times when i feel overwhelmed working and being
    a wife and mom. i never seem to get a break. we live with my husband''s dad because
    we had some credit problems and are trying to get back on our feet. my father-in-law
    thinks i should do most of the household chores and that i should still be able
    to find enough time for myself -- but it hasn''t worked out that way. if i want
    to spend a few hours with my friends, my husband and his dad think it''s an imposition
    when i ask them to baby-sit. on the other hand, my husband takes off and hangs
    out with his friends any time he feels like it. am i wrong to feel there''s a
    double standard here? don''t get me wrong -- my husband and son and i do spend
    some time together, and we''re active in our church. but i can''t help feeling
    i need more time for myself. please help. -- overloaded in the northwest'

    having worked in child care more than 20 years, the best advice i can offer is
    this: when the misbehaving starts, ask the parent, "would you like to handle this
    or do you want me to?" that way, you acknowledge the misbehavior and the fact
    that it must be dealt with, without undermining the parent. waiting until the
    next day to discipline the child would serve no useful purpose. -- another pro

    my husband, "hank," and i are in our late 20s and have been married five years.

    i''m writing about the letter from "angry mama," whose 9-year-old daughter, "kristy,"

    learning from her mom''s response to the insult? to bear it silently and passively?

    it''s rude and i don''t like it." her mother''s apparent silence to this dad sends
    a message even more debilitating than his "weirdo" insults that the child will

    and they have both been nagging me to study harder. my mom and dad don''t understand
    what it''s like for me at school. keeping my grades up has become more difficult
    because i don''t have the motivation to immerse myself in the mandatory curriculum.
    i have no need whatsoever for those boring academic requirements. the one thing
    i''m good at is art -- drawing and painting -- and i can do that on my own. sometimes
    i wonder why i need high school at all. i''d love to have a break from it. how
    can i clue my parents in to what i''m all about, abby? -- frustrated teen in vermont'

    "ready-or-not" needs to recognize the things she''ll have to sacrifice if she
    gets pregnant. does she go to parties? no more! late nights with girlfriends?
    nope! romantic dates with her boyfriend? that''s over. she''ll never do anything
    spontaneous again. i love kids. then i spent a weekend baby-sitting a 3-year-old
    and an infant. it was then i realized that i couldn''t even jump into a shower
    without planning it in advance. as i anxiously struggled to listen to the baby
    monitor over the sound of the shower, i knew i wasn''t ready. and i haven''t even
    addressed the issue of money. even if you have the best baby shower in the world,
    there are still the day-to-day expenses -- diapers, ointments, baby wipes, clothes,
    more diapers, food, bottles, toys, pacifiers, more diapers, and baby-proofing

    i have been involved with "christopher" for three years. our relationship started
    out as an affair. chris was married with two small children and lived two doors
    down from me. he ended up leaving his wife and kids for me -- causing pain for
    everyone. after the divorce, chris was ordered to pay child support, alimony and
    the family''s mortgage. he stopped paying when his wife moved in a lover who was
    a neighbor from across the street. soon after that she kicked him out and took
    up with a guy she met on the internet. the two children were neglected and finally
    taken into state custody. (they have since been returned to her after a year-long
    court battle.) the state would never allow christopher to take the kids because
    his ex brought to light his prison history and ongoing alcohol addiction. my problem
    is, after three years of this drama, i still feel i can''t trust chris -- that
    he always needs to be "baby-sat." he is not the world''s most responsible guy.
    for instance, instead of going to work, he may end up in a bar -- and not even
    call to let me know. i''m always scared and worrying about what he''s doing and
    where he is. on top of all this, chris is facing more prison time. my head tells
    me he''s not worth the trouble he''s caused, but my heart won''t let go of the
    hope he''ll change. maybe i should have walked away when he first cheated on his
    wife with me -- the first time he lied, the first time he left me in the middle
    of the night to go out and do who-knows-what. should i wait until chris goes to
    jail, then send him a dear john letter and start over someplace else? or should
    i get out now? if i threatened to leave him, he''d go nuts. yet he feels ok about
    living a reckless and selfish life. abby, who really has the problem here -- me
    or him? -- confused to the maximum in missouri'

    my wife, "bonnie," and i have been married for 25 years and have two great kids.
    when our daughter left for college three years ago, bonnie began to "rediscover
    herself." in the process, she became friendly with "roger," a 35-year-old single
    man from our church. i found a picture of him hidden in bonnie''s bible. roger
    lived with our family for two weeks before moving to a neighboring city. every
    morning when he was here, bonnie got up early to make his breakfast and was at
    the door to say her "goodbyes." she has never done that for me. a few months ago,
    roger contacted our 19-year-old daughter when he was passing through her college
    town and took her to dinner. afterward they stopped by her apartment, and roger
    kissed her on the lips, telling her it would be "their secret." as soon as our
    daughter was able to convince him to leave, she called us to tell us what happened.
    my problem is that bonnie has forgiven roger, but my daughter, son and i have
    not. my wife continues to see him on occasion, although always in the company
    of others. however, in paying our bills, i have discovered that she calls his

    my husband, "elmer," seeks attention from every woman he meets. he tells stories
    boasting about himself, and it''s always about what he did 40 or 50 years ago.
    elmer will say to a friend, "tell so-and-so (the wife of a mutual friend) i still
    love her." or, "how''s my old sweetheart? tell that little lady i''m still waiting
    for her." other times, elmer will telephone a buddy and if the wife answers, he''ll
    start with, "this is your old lover-boy," instead of giving his name. most of
    the time i''m embarrassed for my husband. i also consider his behavior disrespectful

    i am engaged to be married in september to the most wonderful man in the world.
    we are wildly in love. we''re both middle-aged with grown children from previous
    marriages, so we took our time and approached this relationship with caution.
    he is jewish and i am gentile, but our families get along and are thrilled about
    our upcoming union. my problem: with tensions over the political situation in
    the middle east, anti-semitism is on the rise where we live. since the uncertainty
    of sept. 11, my family has become concerned for my safety should i take on a jewish-sounding
    name. my mother remembers the horror of world war ii, so her fear is understandable.
    i would feel uncomfortable, however, not taking my husband''s name. it would appear
    to the world that i am ashamed of his ethnicity or not accepting of it. how can
    i reassure my family that i am doing the right thing? i love them dearly and don''t
    want them to worry, but i couldn''t live with myself if i didn''t do this. --

    i am a 48-year-old woman married almost 28 years. the last 12 have not been good.
    in 1984, my husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and a drug was prescribed
    to control his blood sugar. his doctor urged him to maintain a healthy diet and
    to exercise. he has not done well with his disease -- and continues to smoke.
    three months ago, i found out that he stopped taking his medication. this has
    led him to be a more volatile person than he already was. he''s smashed furniture
    and broken things. my husband has never hit me or our two daughters, but he has
    thrown things in my direction. when he flies into a rage, he is terrifying. our
    girls are now 21 and 18. the older one is being married this summer, and we are
    busy planning the wedding. because of our current financial situation, i don''t
    think we can give her the wedding of her dreams, but my husband promised her $10,000.
    abby, i honestly don''t know where it''s going to come from because i recently
    discovered he has accrued credit card debt to the tune of $75,000. i cannot begin
    to tell you how stressed i am over all this. my spouse does not seem to be worried
    about any of it, and i am at a loss. i''m not working right now, but intend to
    find a job to help us get out of debt. i know wedding vows say "in sickness and
    in health," but what if one partner is not taking care of himself? i am trying
    to decide whether it would be wise for me to move out of state and live with my
    mother, and let my husband try to straighten out his life. i''ll be honest. it''s
    been a long time since i''ve been touched by a man. my husband is impotent and
    won''t seek help for this, either. i have repeatedly begged him to attend a men''s
    diabetic support group, but he refuses. i''d like a nice companion with whom to
    walk through life, but the mere thought makes me feel guilty. thanks for letting
    me unburden myself. these secrets have been with me for too long. -- wants a life

    carry a sketchbook everywhere, and use it. copy the great masters or any artist
    you admire. museums are great for this purpose. practice design and composition.
    all artists are designers. photography is a good way to practice composition.
    observe differences in how people and animals move -- no two are alike. animate
    a bouncing ball. every principle of animation can be found in this exercise. watch
    tv with the sound muted. you will see how animation is mostly about timing. most

    then not attend. the first time around, we planned for 100 and only 25 showed
    up -- causing wasted food and expense. for the next wedding, we planned only for
    the 40 who rsvp''d their acceptance -- and twice as many showed up! it was awful.
    many guests didn''t get to eat. how can we guarantee that people will rsvp and

    my husband, "gene," retired 10 years ago. during his long career, he wore a suit
    and tie every day. although gene was never a slave to fashion, he showered and
    shaved, used a deodorant and put on clean underwear every day. since gene''s retirement,
    his attention to personal hygiene has deteriorated. he showers, shaves and changes
    his clothes only once or twice a week. i have to constantly change our bedding
    and use room freshener on the pillows, sofa cushions, etc. i have tried presenting

    i''ve been going out with an extraordinarily attractive woman i''ll call alice.
    we love spending time together. however, she has some issues i don''t know how
    to handle. alice was abused by several ex-boyfriends and her self-esteem is zero.
    she is intelligent, witty, caring -- but doesn''t believe a word i say because
    of the mind games she has been subjected to. i''m one of those "knight in shining
    armor" types who is faithful, doesn''t throw temper tantrums, remembers to put
    the toilet seat down, gives my lady fresh flowers, etc., but whenever we talk
    about our future, she ends up in tears. she tells me she doesn''t deserve to be
    treated so nicely and runs away because everything i am is so foreign to her.

    here is a true "he never says he loves me" story: on a beautiful, moonlit night
    in august of 1935, my future husband, bill, and i were on our first date. we went
    swimming in a small lake with a dance pavilion on the shore. from the beach, bill
    and i could hear the orchestra. suddenly we both got very quiet, listening to
    a beautiful melody. when the song ended, bill said, "gee, that''s a pretty song
    -- do you know the name of it?" i answered, "love me forever." bill took my hand
    and said, "well, that''s a long time, but i''d sure like to try!" over the years,
    whenever i told the story about "our song," i liked to tease bill with, "that
    was the first and last romantic thing you ever said to me." not the truth, of
    course, but it made a good story. i am now an 86-year-old widow. my bill died
    in 1971 -- and the "forever" feels as true today as it did that summer night.

    was caught in the act of molesting and sodomizing his 9-year-old female cousin.

    i think my husband, "vinnie," is having an affair. for the past 11 months, he
    has refused to have sex with me. he has even called me by another woman''s name
    in his sleep. vinnie drives a company car and has picked up a co-worker, "rita,"
    every morning for the past three years. he says his boss demands that he drive
    her to and from work. in the past year when we''ve been out with his co-workers''
    friends, they say to me, "oh, you must be rita." it makes me feel like a total
    idiot. vinnie makes light of this and says i am being insecure and paranoid. i
    caught vinnie in an affair several years ago -- pants down. he said it was because
    he was drunk. he apologized and stopped drinking, but has recently started imbibing
    again. i might understand vinnie wandering if i had let myself go, but i weigh
    the same as the day we were married. i have been faithful and i serve him a hot
    meal every night. abby, i have invested a lot in our relationship and am reluctant
    to chuck it all. however, i am at my wit''s end and am tempted to let him go and
    see a lawyer. what''s your advice? -- smelling the coffee in north carolina'

    i am very worried about my 12-year-old daughter, "carrie." she''s in seventh grade.
    the other night, i came across a letter she was writing to a girlfriend from school.
    it said, "i have ''frenched'' with him twice in the hallway.''" i was shocked!
    after taking a little while to get it together, i calmly asked carrie about it.
    she refused to explain. abby, this is a girl who wanted (and got) a barbie talking
    dream house for christmas! how can she be french- kissing anyone? carrie and i
    have always been close, but now i realize she has confided in me less and less
    over the last several months. as she''s gotten older, i''m afraid i don''t know
    who she is anymore. her father and i are separated. he is currently enrolled in
    a 28-day alcohol recovery program. carrie has not had much of a relationship with
    him for a couple of years now. i know that you are going to suggest counseling,
    and i am not opposed to that. however, my real question is, how do i convince
    my daughter to go? i know she''ll fight it, and i hate the idea of forcing her
    to do anything. -- worried and confused mom in delaware'

    i am a 38-year-old, college-educated, single woman. i have a good job and own
    my own home. a few months ago, i met "willie," a divorced man who is a couple
    of years younger than me. we initially exchanged e-mails, then met in person after
    several weeks. willie is also well-educated and has a good job. we are extremely
    compatible, and our relationship has progressed to the point that we are now discussing
    marriage. the problem is my mother and single, older sister disapprove of me spending
    time with willie. they say i don''t spend enough time with them and he is trying
    to separate us. when we began dating, i invited mom and my sister to join us for
    dinners. all my offers were refused. willie did spend christmas with us, but it
    was awkward. i have told them how much willie and i care for each other and that
    marriage is a possibility, but every time i see them, all they do is complain
    about my relationship. wouldn''t you think that when i finally found someone,

    my boyfriend, "brian," and i are in our early 30s. in june we will have been dating
    for six years. we''ve lived together for four. i am ready for marriage and a family,

    once that he would gain nothing by marrying me. frankly, our living arrangement
    has never been financially ideal for me. at the time we moved in together, i had
    been making payments on a small home that would have been paid for by now. i sold
    it (taking a loss) and gave away all my furniture when i moved in with brian.
    he had just purchased a pricey home, and i have always paid him rent and shared
    all living expenses. so i have to ask myself: what does my live-in companion have
    to "lose" financially by marrying me? i continue to pay him rent. at my own expense
    i have painted the bedrooms, put up all new drapes and blinds, planted a beautiful
    garden –- all for a house that''s not even mine. last june, i gave brian one year
    to ask me to marry him. here it is almost may, and he is no closer to proposing

    give us a list of what she had spent on the wedding and to request "our share"
    of the cost -- to the tune of $3,000. this will be the second marriage for both

    may i add my 2 cents'' worth to "miserable daughter-in-law in norfolk, va.," who
    complained that her in-laws treat her as though she''s invisible when her husband
    is away on active duty? to her i would say: "don''t give up on his family, but
    don''t count on them to fill your time. call the navy chaplain, the local college
    or another navy wife." during my husband''s first long cruise, like her, i was
    lost. then i started volunteering for the red cross at portsmouth naval hospital
    and for navy relief in the thrift shop. the more involved one is, the less time
    one has for fretting over in-laws. most important, navy wives whose husbands are
    on sea duty are usually very close-knit and supportive of one another. during
    deployments, such friendships are often closer than relationships with one''s
    own family. it is the responsibility of the captain of the ship, or his wife,
    to see that the spouses have points of contact before the ship departs. a spouse''s
    sea duty can be looked upon as an opportunity to take classes, get together with
    other spouses "in the same boat," or get involved in all sorts of projects. if
    "miserable" takes my advice, her husband, her marriage and the navy will profit

    amount is estimated to be $185 billion in the united states. the emotional cost
    to individuals and their families is immeasurable. our studies show that nearly
    one-third of adults engage in risky drinking patterns. our 2001 national household
    survey on drug abuse found that 13.4 million americans -- 5.9 percent of the population
    -- meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. ninety-one percent
    of these people do not realize they have a problem. for these reasons, i hope
    your readers will attend local alcohol education and screening programs in their
    own communities on april 10. on that day, health programs and agencies, colleges
    and universities, senior centers and community organizations nationwide will offer
    education and screening programs for americans of all ages. they will have the
    opportunity to find out more about alcohol and their health and to complete a
    brief, anonymous, alcohol screening questionnaire to assess if they are risky
    drinkers. please encourage your readers to learn more about national alcohol screening
    day, abby. by sharing this information with them, you are making an important
    contribution to our commitment to promote safe and healthy lives for all. -- tommy

    i operate a home day care for preschool children, and almost every day i''m faced

    my late husband and i had a relationship spanning 30 years. when he was sober,
    he was a good husband and wonderful father to our two children. we separated 10
    years before he died, and he moved out of state with his young mistress, "eve,"
    who did everything she could to damage my relationship with our daughter, "beth."
    she finally succeeded. beth went to live with her father, and she and eve became
    friends. at beth''s wedding, eve appeared in almost every photo, taking my place
    as the "bride''s mother." (my son and i were not invited.) to my husband''s credit,
    it was his wish that i receive his insurance and pension when he died. when our
    son tragically died at age 23, beth and i reconciled. i then remarried and after
    two years was widowed again -- which made me a wealthy woman. i have chosen to
    help beth and her family financially, and i know they are grateful. eve is still
    on the scene 11 years after my husband''s passing, and my 6-year-old grandson
    refers to her as grandma. at times he blurts out that he has "three grandmas"
    -- his father''s mother, eve and me. i feel i should be at center stage without
    an "imposter" waiting in the wings. should i make this an issue or ignore it?
    i feel my daughter is disloyal by allowing this to continue. -- feeling betrayed

    "concerned mother" wrote that she wants to move because her neighbor, "the wicked

    suggest that not everyone wants other people''s children bothering them? i realize

    to leave the neighbor woman alone is a good one. however, advising her to add
    that there is something wrong with the woman ("explain that the neighbor is troubled
    and unhappy") fosters bad manners. it should make no difference to the kiddies
    why they are to leave that woman alone. it should be enough for them to understand

    i''m kinda involved with this guy at work. he''s my boss and he''s really hot.
    "rod" and i started sleeping together almost a year ago, and he''s told me all
    along that he cares a lot for me. my problem is he says he can''t "be" with me,
    because he can''t give me what i deserve emotionally -- he can only fulfill my
    physical needs. so, in my head i''m saying, "ok, that''s better than nothing."
    rod bought me a car and has been generous in the money department. but a couple
    of months ago, he started seeing this other girl. i refer to her as the "sexless
    unwilling virgin." rod says he loves her, but he still wants to sleep with me.
    i don''t understand why he doesn''t love me, and i can''t figure out why he''s
    never taken me out on a real date. lately he only stays overnight when he doesn''t
    have anything else to do. i know he cares for me, and that we have a history he
    doesn''t have with the "s.u.v." should i keep sticking it out? i can''t stop hoping
    that one day we''ll end up being a real couple. rod means the world to me. i''d
    do almost anything for him. what do you think? -- in love with the hot rod'

    my mother and i have always agreed that we don''t interfere with each other''s
    decisions. emotional support and tidbits of advice are welcome -- but no meddling.
    this worked well for us until she met "don" nine months ago. they''re currently
    living together and plan to be married this summer. don spends his afternoons
    at the neighborhood bar, has worked only two weeks since mom has known him (he
    was fired for stealing), has been arrested for shoplifting, and lies about his
    "war experience" in hopes of gaining sympathy. (he never served a day in the military.
    i checked.) mother is one of those women who are incapable of living alone. her
    second husband of eight years died suddenly last year, and since then her life
    has been anything but normal and stable. my sister flat-out told her how she feels
    about don ("dump the loser") and now they''re not speaking. i don''t want to harm
    our relationship, but mom constantly asks me for money i don''t have. what am

    recently, while "under the influence" at a party, "ray," a friend of my boyfriend,
    "pete," tried to kiss me. i avoided ray for the rest of the evening and have not

    he informed me that he had extracted two roses for the receptionists at the front

    i''m nice to your co-workers -- they''re probably envious that you have such a
    good man." at that point i asked him who he was trying to impress -- them or me?
    to make matters worse, hector then announced that the next day (valentine''s day)
    he would be hooking up with a female friend who was in town. he planned to take
    her, his brother and another female friend out to dinner. i was not included.
    to add insult to injury, hector had the nerve to ask me to baby-sit his brother''s

    he blew up and talked nonstop about how no one ever does "nice stuff" for him.
    then he said he had completely forgotten my birthday -- and even worse, he tried
    to pick a fight. when i shared this with my mother, she told me that rod''s behavior
    could be considered emotional and verbal abuse. he has always gotten angry over

    will." i''ve heard all the stories about how rough he had it growing up. i, on
    the other hand, have pleasant childhood memories and a positive outlook on life.
    the next day rod apologized. he said his outburst was because he was mad at himself
    for forgetting my birthday and embarrassed that other people did things for me

    i read with interest the letter from the unhappy new mother. my husband, "carl,"
    and i experienced the same problems. after our precious daughter was born, carl
    was distant, and we fought more than we had before. i was convinced it was all
    his fault. we were ready to separate until, in a last-ditch effort to save our
    marriage, i sought counseling. with the counselor''s help, i realized i had blamed
    my husband for everything that went wrong and didn''t recognize the degree to
    which i was neglecting him. i had forgotten that carl needed time with me as much
    as the baby did, and i had put my job as mother ahead of everything -- even our
    marriage. in my desire to be a good mother, i had become a bad wife and made carl
    feel he was inadequate for not caring for the baby exactly the way i would have
    -- not changing enough diapers and not appreciating me. i was so focused on our
    baby, i lost sight of the fact that i had changed as much as i had accused my
    poor husband of changing. a year of counseling helped us to work through the rough
    patch. a quick anecdote to close: i got the greatest compliment at the doctor''s
    office yesterday. i was talking to carl on my cell phone, closing our conversation
    with "i love you," and "can''t wait to see you so we can talk some more." after
    i hung up, the receptionist said, "you newlyweds are so cute!" (we''ve been married
    for 10 years.) see, abby? when you give a little, you get a little. but when you

    my husband and i invited an acquaintance -- i''ll call her june -- to our housewarming
    party. as i was showing her the bedroom, june asked to see an opal ring that she
    noticed me wearing on the day we met. i opened my jewelry box and watched as she
    tried it on. just then, the doorbell rang and i rushed to answer it. with all
    the goings-on of the party, i completely forgot about june and the opal ring until
    she said her goodbyes. june laughingly told me the ring had gotten stuck on her
    finger and she couldn''t get the "darn thing" off. then she was gone. that was
    two months ago. june moved out of town and left no forwarding address. my husband
    and i couldn''t locate her. the ring belonged to my husband''s late grandmother
    and was a gift to me on our wedding day. my husband''s mother and sister are furious
    with me for allowing june to walk off with an heirloom. they have been pressing
    me to track her down and take her to court. i continued to search for her with
    no luck until last week, when june called and said she was in town and would like
    to drop by. she never showed up. i''m beginning to wonder if she will ever return
    my ring. i want to avoid conflict and am trying to think of a way to get it back
    without having to go to court. can you help me, abby? -- missing my opal in colorado'

    i have been going with "jeremy" for five years. he''s 28, i''m 25. we love each
    other dearly. we''ve talked seriously about getting married and having children.
    the problem is he''s asked me twice to marry him --- only to take his proposals
    back. the first time, we set a date and started making wedding plans. when jeremy
    changed his mind, i asked if it had anything to do with me. he said no --- that
    he loves me and can''t picture a life without me --- but he was scared. now when
    the subject of marriage comes up and we talk about a wedding and future together,
    jeremy makes remarks like, "yes, if we make it that long." then he starts naming
    all the people we know who have gotten divorced. i blame jeremy''s mother for
    his attitude. she''s been married and divorced five times. (her most recent marriage
    lasted less than a year.) i want to spend my life with jeremy more than anything
    in the world, but his negative outlook on marriage worries me. i hate to say it,
    but i''m beginning to resent him for it. should i break it off or stay? -- unsure

    my wife, "alicia," and i were married three months ago. we have a large circle
    of friends who gave us wonderful wedding gifts. yesterday, a package arrived in
    the mail. it was addressed only to alicia, but we opened it together. inside,
    we found a beautifully framed photograph of alicia with her old boyfriend, "enrico."
    it had been taken several years ago on maui. they were laughing with their arms
    around each other (in wet bathing suits) in front of a beautiful tropical sunset.
    i was very offended. i took the photograph out of the frame and tore it up. alicia
    thinks i overreacted, but i couldn''t help myself. enrico has never liked me because
    "i took alicia away from him." i believe he intentionally wanted to push my buttons
    -- and he succeeded. i totally trust alicia, but feel my anger was justified.

    recently the six ladies in my garden club got together to celebrate the birthday
    of one of the "girls." we are all in our 50s and 60s and have been friends for
    years. they all know i have an allergy to nuts, and eating even one can cause
    a violent reaction. therefore, i always make a point of asking if nuts are in
    any of the dishes served at our get-togethers. one of the ladies, "mary," served
    a beautiful casserole. when i asked her if it contained any nuts, she said, "of
    course not -- i know you''re allergic." just before we sat down to eat, one of
    the other women pulled me aside and warned me not to eat any of mary''s casserole
    because it did, indeed, have nuts. when i confronted mary and asked if it was
    true, she laughed and replied, "this so-called allergy is all in your head, and
    i was going to do you a favor by proving it to you today." abby, i have seen several
    doctors about my allergy. it is not "in my head." nuts can cause my blood pressure
    to skyrocket and cause terrible headaches and vomiting. how should i handle my
    friendship with mary after this incident? -- allergic to nuts in georgia'

    my youngest son, "jason," is a senior in high school and an all-around good kid.
