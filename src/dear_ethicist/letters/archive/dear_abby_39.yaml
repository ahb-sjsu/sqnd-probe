    can you please help resolve a question once and for all between my husband and
    me regarding the proper way to eat grapes? my husband will pick individual grapes
    from a bunch which, in my opinion, leaves the rest looking "moth-eaten" and unappetizing.
    i prefer to cut a small branch off the bunch, which leaves the grapes looking
    fresh instead of grazed upon. who''s right? -- carrie in milford, mich.'

    i have been dating a married man for 30 years. our relationship started a few

    it started just as a way for me to get sexual experience. for him, i think he
    was infatuated with the idea that a younger woman found him attractive. i asked
    him out knowing he was married, thus safe from expecting a commitment. i don''t
    think either of us expected our so-called relationship to last this long. i have
    dated other men (who knew nothing of him) and gave birth to a child (not his),
    so it''s not like he''s the only man i see. (of course, he knows i date other

    since my husband and i were married two years ago, my relatives have been asking
    when we are going to have kids. i know they mean well, but these relatives all
    have a tendency to talk among themselves once they find juicy gossip to circulate.
    i am now pregnant with our first child. i have asked my immediate family to keep
    the happy news to themselves and let the others find out later in my pregnancy
    or after the birth of my child. how do we respond to these nosy, gossipy relatives
    when they ask, "why didn''t you tell us sooner?" -- staying mum for now'

    i have been concerned about my parents for some time now. they are elderly and
    live in a retirement community. they have a very nice home and don''t have to
    worry about money. the problem is, they drink every day -- sometimes from noon
    to when they go to bed. many times, their drinking has caused arguments and police
    visits. when i express my concern about their drinking, they tell me to stay out
    of it, mind my own business, and they''re retired and have earned the right to
    do whatever they want. abby, i don''t mind them having cocktails every now and
    then, but this has gotten out of hand. i think they have become alcoholics and

    i went out to dinner with a close friend last night. during the hour we were at

    "samantha," lives in canada, but giselle says they were soul mates. samantha has
    moved on and now has another sweetheart, but giselle won''t move on. it has been
    many months and giselle is still trapped in this bubble of sadness. she won''t
    stop talking about how much she loves samantha. i kept reassuring her everything
    would be ok and maybe she would find somebody else like her internet friend did.
    after a few months, she became angry with me, and accused me of not being supportive
    of her trying to get samantha back. she also accused me of not understanding "what
    girl-to-girl love is," which makes no sense, considering that i''m bi. this has
    been going on for nearly a year. should i back off, or must i continue to be supportive
    of something i know can''t happen? -- trying to be supportive'

    wipe down shower walls after use." she asks me to change the sheets or launder
    our towels before i leave. although she has decorative paper hand towels in the

    i have been married for almost three years to a woman who refuses to share the

    her late 40s and had never been married before. we have been intimate only twice
    in the last year. moreover, she doesn''t let me sit next to her while we watch
    tv, and there is no kissing, no touching, no affection of any kind, physical or

    he isn''t sure he ever wants to rebuild a relationship with her. i know that''s
    his decision to make, and if he doesn''t want her in his life, that''s fine. but
    i couldn''t live with myself if i ignored her, too. i just wanted her to know
    she could stop looking and wondering if her brother is still alive. so i told
    her. she was grateful to have some closure and know that he is doing well, and
    she reassured me that she wouldn''t contact him again unless he reaches out to
    her. even if they never talk again, i think she deserved to know she had found
    him. now i feel guilty for going behind his back and meddling in things that aren''t
    my business. but i can''t imagine spending my whole life searching for a family

    she will graduate from school soon, and hopefully start working right after. she
    now says that when she starts working, she wants to keep separate bank accounts

    my family recently moved to a new state and was blessed to find a wonderful new

    a place for us to practice church etiquette with our son so that we could someday
    sit with the rest of the congregation without disturbing the mass. the culture
    at this church is different; the cry room seems more like a playroom. seeing all
    the other children running around makes keeping my toddler sitting in the pew
    nearly impossible (think major meltdowns). if we allow him to play with the other
    children, we spend the mass feeling like we''ve failed as christian parents. the

    i''m a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic
    relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various
    reasons. in between, i''ve gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting
    a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have
    no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy
    while i enjoy single life. i''m about to repeat the pattern again. i''m a few
    months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it''s great
    to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i
    have no intention of meeting in person. what''s your insight on this, and do you
    think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern?

    my grandmother gets on my case all the time because i don''t clean the bathroom
    every day. she grew up in the ''50s and ''60s and was a stay-at-home mom to two
    boys. however, i am a graduate student with a part-time job. i spend hours studying,
    and when i get some free time, i use it to do things i actually want to do. my
    grandmother insists that everyone she knows/knew cleans their house every day,
    and when she talks about cleaning the bathroom, she doesn''t mean just picking
    things up; she means spraying down all surfaces and getting out the bleach or
    foam spray to clean down the bathtub. i don''t think she understands that no one
    i know -- at least my age -- cleans their house that way every single day, and
    that because i''m busy most days and often tired, i don''t want to come home and
    clean the whole house. am i lazy, or am i right in telling her that i will not
    deep-clean my bathroom/apartment every day? (i think deep-cleaning every two weeks
    is fine.) the free time i have is precious. how often is appropriate? -- southern

    i live in a beautiful apartment in the perfect location and have been here for
    three years. this past year my neighbors had a second baby. this child cries constantly
    during all hours of the night and most of the day. i hear the wailing and the
    parents yelling and slamming doors when they are frustrated. i thought as the
    child got a little older it would get better, but it hasn''t. he''s now 1 1/2
    and still crying constantly. i''m stressed out and losing sleep because of the
    constant commotion. in the beginning, the parents were tolerant of their child,
    and i didn''t complain because i didn''t want to stress them out. now i feel stuck.
    should i complain directly to them, contact the building manager or just make
    arrangements to move? i feel like a terrible person to complain. we must give
    young children and parents some leeway, but this isn''t their first child, and
    i worry that something more is going on. i love this place, but i cannot continue

    i have fought obesity all of my adult life, and my weight has yo-yoed over the
    years. my problem is, when i go to the doctor''s office and i am taken to the
    exam area, the scale is right out in the open where other patients come and go
    as well as all the office personnel. mind you, i don''t care if i am weighed in
    the presence of people walking around -- if they don''t peek. however, when the
    medical assistant is done weighing me, she reads the scale out loud. i have felt
    humiliated when other patients are walking past. i have put up with this for years.
    recently, this medical assistant weighed me and i just knew she was going to "announce"
    my weight. this time there was a man i could tell was a patient, standing nearby
    at the reception window staring intently at me getting weighed. because i was
    sure the m.a. was going to say it out loud, i started to cough to try to muffle
    the sound of her voice. it worked, but then she acted irritated because of my
    coughing, so she repeated it loudly. i was very embarrassed, to say the least.
    when the doctor saw me, i was afraid to say anything as i didn''t want to get
    anybody in trouble. i graduated from a medical assistant school many years ago
    and i remember the registered nurse who was our instructor taught us to never
    say out loud somebody''s weight when you weigh him or her. it only makes common
    sense. i no longer want to go back to that doctor''s office. do you have any advice
    for me when this happens again? i say again because it happens at other doctor''s
    offices i visit as well. i am at a loss here. i would appreciate your input. --

    i met "edward" at work six years ago. we were instantly attracted to each other

    stray outside my marriage, even though my marriage has been very lonely. i love
    edward more than i ever thought possible, but even though he has strong feelings
    for me, he says he will never file for divorce from his wife. we are still involved,
    but i am heartbroken that he doesn''t want me enough to leave her. he has never
    said that he loves his wife, just that he doesn''t believe in divorce. i have
    never felt such a strong connection with anyone, ever! my head tells me to forget

    our daughter came home for spring break from college with troubling news. she
    has been sexually harassed by a very large and aggressive lesbian in her dorm
    this year. when the girl first came on to her, my daughter told her no. later,
    on two separate occasions, the girl pushed her to the floor and groped her in
    the lobby of the dorm. my daughter was afraid to fight the girl because she''s
    small. she was also afraid to report it -- i guess she thought it was an isolated
    incident. recently she found out that the girl has done the same thing to several
    other girls. they all went to the title ix people on campus to file a complaint,
    but were told they won''t get any answers until late summer, which is after school
    is out. is this kind of harassment common in our schools? should she take it to
    the campus police or city police? our daughter really likes her college, but she
    shouldn''t have to put up with this. -- troubling news'

    my son chose his cousin, "tim," as best man for his wedding. tim gave a speech
    about how my son was like a little brother to him and mentioned some of the pranks
    he would play on my son. it was extremely funny, but the reality is that the pranks
    were quite cruel. my nephew got very drunk at the wedding, and while my son was
    dancing with his new bride, a final prank was pulled. tim approached my son from
    behind and gave him a huge "wedgie," which tore my son''s expensive wedding pants
    apart. my son was very angry. his new bride appeared shocked, and it was a terrible
    ending to an otherwise beautiful wedding. my sister promised me that tim would
    "make it right." it''s now four weeks later, and i have learned that my son immediately
    apologized to his cousin for his reaction (which was understandable). tim did
    not apologize and has not accepted any accountability. i thought perhaps his wedding
    gift would cover the cost of the pants, but my son says it was less than the cost
    of the thank-you gift my son and his wife gave my nephew. my sister and her son

    i''m a widow and have been seeing someone for two years. he often stays at my
    home. he treats me well, but we have different tastes in furnishings. he brings
    me trinkets and tacky accessories from his home that i do not display. my spare
    bedroom closet is filled with these unwanted items. he knows i can afford to buy
    the things i like. recently he gave me two gifts -- both new -- neither of which
    i feel are appropriate for me. i appreciate the thought, but why would he continue
    to do this? he can clearly see they are not on display in my home, which would
    indicate i don''t like or want them. this man is not a cheapskate. he takes me
    for nice dinners, movies, brings flowers and chocolates as well. i don''t want
    to hurt his feelings. should i continue to accept the gifts and pretend i''m thrilled?
    i don''t want to appear to be ungrateful or spoiled, because he is kind and generous.

    my younger sister lives at home with our parents. she suffers from a learning

    she is a bright, sweet person who -- with some help -- could become semi-independent.
    however, my parents have made no serious attempts to encourage this. she graduated
    from high school 10 years ago and has sought no further education or employment
    opportunities. she spends most of her time in her room playing video games. i
    have tried to offer suggestions like volunteering or joining an organization.
    while this is met with polite positivity, it has inspired no action. our parents
    are getting older, and if my sister isn''t able to live independently, the burden
    of supporting her will fall on me. i am not permitted to express how frustrating
    this situation is or how sad it makes me. i am shut out of the conversation, even

    i have been divorced for eight years. my ex and i are on civil terms and text
    each other a few times a week regarding our kids, mutual friends and general chitchat.
    a few months ago, during a rough patch in my relationship with my girlfriend of
    three years, "lily," i expressed my frustration in one of these texts. it was
    nothing horrible or unkind, just venting a bit. a week or so later, lily was spending
    the night and i awoke at 2 a.m. to find an empty bed. i discovered her in the
    living room with my phone, surfing through my texts. she was livid about the communication
    with my ex, particularly the one in which i commented about our relationship,
    and stormed out. i have no password on my phone and nothing to hide from lily
    and told her so. i admitted that my ex was not an appropriate person to discuss
    our relationship with and apologized. this has caused a permanent shift in our
    relationship on two levels: she is angry and suspicious regarding my communication
    with my ex, and i am having trust issues with her. i feel my privacy was invaded
    and wonder what else lily has searched to satisfy her curiosity. she has yet to
    apologize and feels justified in what she did. i contend that if she hadn''t read
    the texts, especially in such an underhanded way, there would be no ill feelings.

    great -- we have similar interests, and we''re both not afraid to speak our minds,

    is my temper. i have an explosive, flash temper. when he does something i dislike,
    such as hang out with a female friend, stay out late drinking, talk about things
    i find annoying or insensitive, i go on a rampage. i say heartless things, threaten
    to leave him and do everything in my power to make him feel guilty. as soon as
    i get a few minutes to gather my thoughts and cool down, i realize how out of
    control i have become, and i profusely attempt to apologize and make up for it.
    but the damage is already done. i have concluded that i am a major part of the
    problem, and i am desperately trying to change my ways: i think before i speak,
    assess before i assume, and try to ask polite questions rather than blindly accuse.

    which they apparently didn''t do. now, three months later, my in-laws are visiting
    us, and my mother-in-law is having the kids pay for the frame. when i spoke up
    and let her know i thought this was inappropriate, she became very upset and said,
    "kids these days don''t have any consequences," and this is what she and the kids
    had agreed should happen. i emphasized in front of the kids how important it is
    to listen, to be accountable for your actions and to see what they could''ve done
    to make it up to her. i''m just not comfortable with her still holding onto this
    and expecting them to pay for the frame. it seems to me that a conversation about
    respect and listening is plenty appropriate but, after that, shouldn''t my mother-in-law
    have gracefully let it go? these kids, by the way, get excellent school reports,
    play instruments and sports, and are considered by most people to be great kids.
    was i wrong to express my opinion that having the kids pay her is inappropriate?
    if it wasn''t, then maybe we shouldn''t visit at her home, since it''s filled
    with breakable valuables. i am very frustrated by my controlling mother-in-law.

    i am going to my girlfriend''s mother''s 60th birthday party. i just found out
    that her younger sister is pregnant -- unbeknownst to her parents -- and she plans
    to surprise them the next day on their mom''s actual birthdate. the little sister
    has asked that we not drink at the dinner because she doesn''t want to feel left
    out. this caused an argument between me and my girlfriend because i think her

    a glass of wine at a birthday dinner? if i''m on a diet, i don''t ask people to

    party selling products. the proceeds will be donated to fulfilling a "cancer bucket
    list," which includes pampering, trips and other luxuries. i sympathize with anyone
    having a terminal illness, but why does that mean i have to give money? do they
    have a right to be pampered on other people''s dime? this kind of fundraising,
    without real financial need, seems to happen often: co-workers who have had accidents,
    fires, unexpected or stressful incidents all have office collections set up, even
    when they are fully insured and the damage is covered by their policies. a friend

    few years later we were contacted via the adoption agency by the paternal birth

    out of jail and they thought the photos would help keep him out of trouble. we
    sent a nice collection of photos and an update on our child. the next year, the
    birth grandparents sent a letter saying they would like more contact, including

    who now is back in jail, never contacted us and, as far as we know, does not want
    any contact. the adoption agency says they will pass on information between us,
    but doesn''t have any advice on what we should do. our daughter is 6 and has expressed
    interest in her birth family. my husband wants no contact with the birth grandparents
    since neither of the birth parents consented to contact and it was a closed adoption.

    i''m a 16-year-old piano student. my piano teacher is a wonderful person and i
    enjoy taking lessons from her, but there is one problem: she is always late. usually
    it''s 15 to 20 minutes, but other times i might be kept waiting for an hour or
    more. she also switches my lesson because of her busy schedule, which means i
    have to forgo many activities at the last minute. i have never missed anything
    important, but still, i am annoyed when i have to miss something i was looking
    forward to for a piano lesson. i''m not sure what to do. how should i tell her
    to start coming on time? i really don''t want to find another teacher, but this
    is very annoying. -- frustrated in wisconsin'

    her same-sex marriage is a sin. i have explained that it will be a civil ceremony

    she just wouldn''t participate. she''s racking her brain and her bible trying
    to find a way to square her faith with her love for me and my soon-to-be fiance.
    despite this, i can''t help feeling hurt that she views my relationship as a sin
    she can''t be part of. if she decides she can''t stand with me in my wedding,

    my husband is extremely critical of others. he almost never has anything nice
    to say about anyone. he badmouths his co-workers, friends, family members and
    strangers. we don''t have friends anymore because he doesn''t want to be around
    them. i don''t understand his type of personality. he thinks his way of thinking
    and doing things is the only right way and everyone else is wrong. he''s always
    quick to shift the blame when something goes awry. if he accidentally bumps into
    someone or breaks something, it''s never his fault -- the person was in his way,
    or the broken object was junk, etc. what makes people this way? is there any hope
    that he can change? we are nearing retirement age, and i need my space. i cannot

    i have encountered an "over-hugger." i hug often, but respect how others feel
    about it. this person does not extend that courtesy. his typical hug involves
    picking the recipient up off the ground, which i think is his way of showing off.
    the last time i saw him i offered my hand. instead, he yanked me in and said,
    "we give hugs here!" it felt invasive. i know he is trying to show love, but he
    puts his own desire before the needs of others. i want to tell him not to hug
    me anymore. however, it''s complicated because we are part of a loose-knit athletic
    community, and people hug left and right at our events. i hug a lot of people,
    but i''m polite about it. not only would i likely have to declare "no hugs" to
    him in front of others, but it would become obvious that we don''t hug. am i odd
    to not want him to hug me? would i be wrong to just tell him i''d prefer a handshake?

    my boyfriend, "joe," has what i refer to as "pedestrian rage." neither of us drives,
    so we use mass transit or walk everywhere. we live in a large city and drivers
    are not always careful about pedestrians in parking lots, crosswalks, etc., making
    it doubly important to protect one''s own safety when on foot. i feel that joe
    compromises our safety by being confrontational with motorists who fail his exacting
    standards. he curses loudly, strikes vehicles with his hand, or stops and glares
    at drivers who anger him. i have asked him repeatedly not to engage with these
    drivers for fear of retaliation. the other day a man drove into the crosswalk
    when we were crossing on the green light. we weren''t close to that section of
    the crosswalk yet, but joe smacked the man''s car as we crossed behind it. the
    man, who was very large and very angry, pulled over, jumped out and threatened
    to beat joe up for touching his car. i pulled joe down the sidewalk as he yelled
    at the driver. i am at my wit''s end. i''m afraid to go anywhere with him because
    he just doesn''t get it. i no longer feel safe with him. his behavior is ruining

    i''m a 29-year-old self-made millionaire who has spent the last decade saving
    and investing my middle-class income. i grew up dirt poor, so at 18 i left home
    with $5, went straight to work and never looked back. recently, i''ve realized
    that i struggle to make friends for fear they''ll find out about my financial
    situation. those who know only want to talk about money or treat me differently.
    most of my peers are broke and it makes me feel guilty. those with high incomes
    blow their money on fancy dinners and luxury vehicles. i''m just a working-class
    woman who likes driving my 10-year-old car, and i don''t feel like i fit in with
    anyone. in fact, i''m developing an anxiety. a few months ago i went to the bank
    to deposit a large sum of money and was mortified to see that the bank teller
    was a friend of the family. i have gone to the extreme of lying about owning homes
    and going on vacations, and it''s making me crazy. i even have issues with letting
    my young daughter''s friends come over for playdates, for fear that the other

    didn''t end very well, so i liked the attention. i decided i was fine with just
    kissing, but as soon as i got in his truck, he started to feel me up. he took
    me to a semi-isolated area and we ended up having sex. it wasn''t fun or pleasurable.
    i told him he was hurting me, but he didn''t stop until the third time i said
    it. he was very upset with me. he only cared about me pleasuring him. i told two
    of my close friends about what happened. one said he had essentially raped me.

    didn''t bring any of these critters home, but if we must hire an exterminator

    i have been married to "george" for 20 years. we have a solid relationship except

    my oldest son came to me nine months ago asking my opinion. he wanted to donate
    sperm to a black lesbian couple (for a fee) so they could have a biracial child.
    he told me he needed the money. i told him i didn''t approve because they are
    lesbians. (sorry, i''ll be bashed for that statement, but i have to be honest.)
    i have a biracial 10-year-old son, so race isn''t the issue. had it been a heterosexual
    couple of any race, i would have been ok. however, what i told him was that if
    he gives up his rights to the child, i, too, won''t have grandparents'' rights.
    i broke down in tears when he told me all this. yesterday i received a picture
    of a newborn. it turns out my son donated his sperm knowing how i feel about homosexuality.
    i have tried hard to always be there for my children, letting them know i love
    them and doing the best a single mother could do for them. i feel i must have
    failed horribly in bringing him up to be a better man. i cannot, in our home state,

    i met a man eight years ago who has become everything to me. we see each other

    our relationship is not only emotional but also physical. we are secretive about
    our relationship only with our children -- we appear in public together, and my
    spouse knows about it. many people at our regular venues comment on how much in
    love we seem to be. a few of my friends are privy to our relationship and wonder
    when we''re leaving our spouses to be together. my question is: can''t it just
    be ok to be happy with what we have? we enjoy the times we have traveled, talked
    and loved. i am virtually ignored by my spouse, as is he. the time he has been
    in my life is the happiest i have ever been. but i don''t want more. it''s hard

    one of my close friends may be "ghosting" me. "sarah" and i have known each other
    since middle school. we went to high school together and roomed together during
    our freshman year of college. we both transferred to different schools after that
    freshman year, but we made it a point to keep in touch. i was the first person
    she came out to. i helped her move into her new apartment the summer before grad
    school. in general, i think i''ve been a good friend to her. last summer we both
    moved back to our hometown -- she for med school and i for a new job. i was excited
    that after five years we were living in the same city again. i have reached out
    to her on multiple occasions, but my texts and calls usually go unanswered. when
    i do get a response, it''s typically, "sorry! i''m just too swamped!" i don''t
    doubt that med school is incredibly difficult, and i completely understand that
    that''s where her focus should be, but over the holidays i reached out once again
    and was given the same answer. i know she made time to see another friend -- her
    best, who ranks higher than i do in the "who to see" list. it still hurt. am i
    being too sensitive? too self-centered? i''m worried that this is sarah''s way
    of breaking ties with me and i''m just not taking the hint. an outsider''s point
    of view would really help, even if it''s a harsh truth. -- left hanging in miami'

    i was in a six-year relationship with a woman. we shared a home and have a child
    together, whom i support. she has primary custody, and i provide financial support
    and exercise my visitations regularly. we broke up six months ago and she immediately
    moved a man into the house. since they split up, she has done this again with
    a new person. i have moved on and am content being single and focusing on my career
    and parenting my son when he''s with me. where i struggle is when these new men
    want to meet me. i don''t feel obligated to shake their hands, be polite and friendly
    or be a supportive, smiling face. i''m disturbed by the speed she moves into other
    relationships. i feel like it sets a bad example for my son regardless of how
    "nice" these men are. there is no record of abuse, and i do believe my ex is a
    good mother, just maybe lonely and very dependent on having companionship. i understand
    life goes on and people move on, but at what point is this unhealthy? am i wrong

    ago i asked to use his phone to look up something on the internet because my battery
    had died. it opened up to a gay porn site! i was shocked and asked him if it was
    something he was looking at. he admitted that it was. nothing like this has happened
    to me before, so i began asking if that''s what he likes and is into. he assured
    me the answer was no. he said he looked because he was simply curious about it.
    he told me he loves women and doesn''t want to be with men. he said he was just
    looking. i believe him, but is this normal behavior? -- weirded out in the west'

    my husband of 40 years is a smoker. i am not, but have learned to live with the
    smell, etc. most of the time he smokes outside, except in winter, when he opens
    the bathroom window, smokes his cigarette, puts it out in the toilet and disposes
    of the butt in the trash can. he has begun a new behavior that is really bothering
    me. when he wakes up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, he''ll light
    up a cigarette, take a few puffs and then put it out and return to bed. when he
    gets back in our bed, he stinks! and he coughs and coughs. i try not to nag him
    about his smoking, but i''d really like to bring this up. any suggestions on how?

    i need some relationship advice. how do you handle household expenses with a partner?

    does buy groceries, although not all of them. he also helps around the house and

    matters to me is money and threatens to move out. i feel completely taken advantage

    in the past, you have printed letters about neighbors taking food to people who
    are grieving. i recently lost my wife of 57 years. her death was unexpected. i
    ended up with a refrigerator and freezer overflowing with so much food i could
    not eat it all. losing someone dear to you kills your appetite. trust me, at a
    time like this, you aren''t hungry. may i offer an alternative to cooking food
    and taking it over, especially if the recipient lives alone? call the person and
    invite him or her to dinner at your home, or ask what night you could bring dinner
    over and have supper with the individual. speaking from firsthand experience,
    for me the worst time of day (besides bedtime) is being alone at dinner when daylight
    fades. what''s hard isn''t that i might have to prepare or warm up some of the
    food someone thoughtfully brought, but it''s the emptiness of the house -- the
    sense of isolation. about two weeks after the funeral, a couple of dear friends
    invited me over for dinner and games. they understood what a difference it would
    make in helping me cope with a great loss. and bless my daughter and "son-in-love"

    i don''t know what to do with my parents'' wedding album. my mother gave it to
    me as a gift when i was a teen, and i assume it was a coming-of-age consideration.
    i''m now in my 30s with a career that has me moving around frequently. i have
    moved once a year for at least the last five years, and i have had to pack up
    this album and box it every time. i think that when my mother gave it to me, she
    figured i would pass it on to grandchildren, but i have chosen to not reproduce.
    my parents'' marriage was anything but storybook. what little i remember was abusive
    and chaotic, and my parents split up before i reached kindergarten. while these
    photos are fantastic imagery of a certain era, i do not want to move them around

    over the past month or so, i find myself being super territorial about my home
    and the things that are in it. this is my first apartment on my own after having
    had a roommate for three years. recently, my significant other got sick, and he
    was constantly here because i had to take care of him. also, my family was here
    over the holidays. i didn''t want anyone in my room or using my bathroom -- not
    even my sick boyfriend. part of the reason was he was sick and, secondly, he was
    keeping me up at night using my master bath every five minutes. working long hours,
    then having to come home and take care of a man who was hardheaded about his health
    was exhausting. i needed my space and to rest. could this be why i don''t want
    anyone in my home? i feel bad about being this way, especially toward my own family

    sometimes parents do need a contact person for emergencies. at what point should
    a person have to contact the police? years ago, parents here in northern california
    didn''t hear from their adult son for a week or two. they thought he was with
    his live-in girlfriend. she thought he had gone to see them. sadly, his body was
    found stuffed in an irrigation pipe weeks later. he had been robbed and murdered.
    hopefully, renee''s three daughters are close enough to have regular contact with
    each other and can call their parents on a regular timetable to check in and assure
    them all is well. -- california mom'

    there is a topic i haven''t seen addressed in your column, namely being sexually
    abused by a spouse. i ended my marriage because my husband was waking me at 2
    a.m. demanding sex. he expected me to have sex only a week after i had our baby,
    although my doctor had said i should wait six weeks. if i thought something he
    wanted me to do was degrading, he insisted i do it anyway. it amazes me that the
    subject of spousal abuse isn''t mentioned in premarital counseling. no one seems
    willing to acknowledge this kind of abuse exists. is there even a "survivors"
    network or support group to cope? i went to individual counseling, but it didn''t
    help me. i think it would be helpful if society would acknowledge this kind of
    thing does happen. i also think that those who offer premarital counseling should
    be required to discuss the warning signs of a sexual abuser. -- the ex mrs. brown'

    my mother married a man, "george," a few years ago. they met online, and he makes
    her happier than i''ve ever seen her. our entire family adores george and is supportive
    of their marriage. my husband and i had our first child, "ella," this year. this
    has made mom''s dreams of becoming a grandma come true. when i see george hold,
    play with, or just be in the same room with my daughter, i can''t help but keep
    a really close eye on how he acts with her. he hasn''t said or done anything for
    me not to trust him, but it makes me really uneasy, and i want to restrict his
    interaction with her. it is my responsibility to protect my baby girl, and i''m
    extra-cautious because i was molested as a young girl. i can''t discuss this with
    mom because she doesn''t know about what happened to me, and i know this would
    cause a huge fight between us. how can i limit george''s contact with ella while
    still giving mom the time she wants with her? is this intuition or paranoia? --

    my stepson just turned 7. my husband was granted custody because the mother was
    declared unfit due to her drug abuse. she was granted supervised visits until
    she can pass two consecutive drug tests. over the last year and a half, her visits
    have become few and far between. my husband and i think it would be a good idea
    for "tony" to start seeing a therapist again. he doesn''t talk about his mother
    often, and i''m worried he may be bottling up a lot of his feelings. tony is starting
    to ask more questions about his mom -- like why he can''t stay the night with
    her, why he can''t live with her, and why he hasn''t seen her much lately. i try
    not to say anything negative about her. is it time to explain the situation to
    him? he is still so young, and i don''t know how to explain things in a way he

    nine years ago i married a man who has a son from a previous marriage. "eli" is

    parents, they support him financially. my husband and i pay eli''s car insurance,
    cellphone bill, toll tag, life insurance policy and whatever other things come
    up (passport, gym membership). eli''s mom assists with all of his utility bills,
    in addition to depositing money in his account monthly. they even turned over
    eli''s 529 tuition account to him. i have tried explaining to my husband that
    they are enabling eli, and the umbilical cord should have been cut years ago.
    eli has never earned more than $12,000 a year and has no desire to try because
    he has an endless flow of financial support. his dad is retired but continues

    during my childhood, my parents fought loudly and often. when i was 12, they spoke
    to my sister and me about getting a divorce. i was heartbroken and fought back.
    like any kid in that situation, i was upset and scared. i told them they were
    being selfish and irresponsible for breaking up our family when they were the
    ones who chose to have children in the first place. they ended up staying together
    and never mentioned the d-word again. it''s 15 years later; they have now been
    married for 40 years. when i''m around, i still hear them squabble, but nothing
    like when i was young. they obviously care about one another. as an adult, i am
    plagued by guilt. had i been older and wiser when they first contemplated divorce,
    i would have agreed that they were probably not a good match, and told them to
    do whatever they needed to be happy. did i do the wrong thing when i was young?
    should i say something now or leave well enough alone? i feel i may have kept
    my parents in a loveless relationship, and while i''m happy they''re still together,
    i can''t help but wonder if i should have kept my mouth shut. i''d appreciate

    my father is 80. in his prime he was a businessman with lots of contacts. most
    of his friends and siblings are gone now. he doesn''t take good care of himself.
    his hair is unkempt, he goes weeks without shaving, his pants sag, and worst of
    all, his fingernails are full of dirt. he doesn''t get out much, so i''m not sure
    it''s important to him. my main concern is how to handle this with the funeral
    home when he dies. is this something they would clean? i can''t imagine putting
    anyone through that. it would also not reflect who he really is. i have never

    my friend of 25 years, "violet," moved back to town a few months ago after living
    far away for the last 10 years. whereas we''ve always called and confided in each
    other often, now that she''s here, i rarely see her, never talk with her and receive
    polite but curt refusals to do anything together. i know the move was stressful
    for her, and i suspect the problem is more about her than me. but i am really
    hurt, and i miss her. my last request to get together and talk was met with, "i''m

    last friday was grandparents'' day at my kids'' preschool. my parents attended
    and were well-behaved for the most part, but then my mother made a faux pas. she
    asked one of the directors when her baby was due. well, abby, the woman isn''t
    pregnant. when i picked up my kids, i had no idea what had happened. the director
    was having a conversation with one of the teachers when i walked in, so as usual
    i smiled and waved as i walked by. i did sense something was off when she didn''t
    respond, but i figured she was preoccupied. when we met my parents for dinner,
    my mother told me what happened. i am mortified. i managed to make it out of the

    in our pool, especially on weekends. my girlfriend doesn''t like to wear a swimsuit,

    politely asked her if she wouldn''t mind covering up when in the pool. she said
    her kids, and i''m sure her hubby, can see into our yard from their second story.
    my girlfriend apologized for their inconvenience, but told them she wouldn''t
    be changing her habits in her home to stop another family from gawking. i see
    both sides of this. i agree she shouldn''t feel compelled to wear a suit to swim

    my wife and i have been friends with another couple, "bill" and "emily," for 20
    years. we usually have dinner together once every four to six weeks. in the past,
    everyone enjoyed a cocktail or a glass of wine with dinner and nobody overdid
    it. but over the last year or so, it is clear that they have started drinking
    earlier in the day, before we arrive. they each consume multiple drinks while
    my wife and i are still on our first. emily often is noticeably drunk within the
    first hour and excuses herself to go to bed while bill continues drinking. often
    dinner plans at their house or at a nearby restaurant must be canceled because
    of this behavior. when they visit our home, emily helps herself to several glasses
    of wine before dinner and then passes out in our guest room, while bill sits on
    the couch rambling on and we speed up the cooking to get food on the table. when
    dinner is finished, we suggest it''s time to call it a night. our get-togethers

    smart, successful, sweet and has a wonderful sense of humor. i adore him and can
    see myself spending many happy years, if not forever, with him. the problem is
    my parents. i''m 24 and a recent college graduate. i have a good job and have
    been living independently since i was 19. edward is 31, divorced and has two kids
    (ages 5 and 8). because of his kids and marital status, my parents refuse to even
    meet him. they claim i''m making a terrible mistake being involved with someone
    with so much "baggage." i am very close to my parents, and their reaction is hurtful.
    this is the happiest i have been in a long time in a relationship, maybe ever.
    neither edward''s kids nor the fact that he''s divorced is an issue for me. i''ve
    met his children and enjoy spending time with them. he has a civil relationship
    with his ex-wife, who also has a new partner. do you think my parents'' reaction
    is fair? do you think in time they''ll come around? -- bittersweet in love in
    michigan'

    my sister-in-law is getting married soon. originally, she asked my 4-year-old
    daughter, "emma," to be her flower girl. emma was very excited. a few weeks ago,
    i asked when my daughter needed to be fitted for her dress. my sister-in-law then
    informed me they had chosen my niece to be the flower girl the day after she asked
    emma. no one ever mentioned it to us. it was left to me to tell my daughter, and
    she was devastated. she still cries about it. i am holding in so much anger and
    hurt that i have been avoiding the family so there won''t be any fighting close
    to the "big day." am i wrong to be upset with my sister-in-law and mother-in-law
    for excluding my little girl and not telling her themselves? -- miffed in alabama'

    i will be receiving some money from a court settlement soon. only five friends
    were true friends and stood by me. they assisted me during the two years i was
    totally destitute. they all know i''m involved in a lawsuit and that i will receive
    compensation. my question is, should i tell them how much i''m getting? i don''t
    like to lie, but the idea of revealing my monetary status makes me uncomfortable.
    i never promised any of them money, so that''s not an issue. i will cheerfully
    compensate them all for their loyalty in ongoing daily ways. what should i do
    or say when they ask how much i received? i don''t want to be perceived as rude.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i recently graduated from college and moved out of my parents'' house and in with
    my fiance. my parents have assumed most of the cost of our upcoming wedding after
    insisting we have a big formal one. i''m also still on their cellphone plan and
    car and health insurance policies. i do not agree with my parents'' religious
    or political views and they know that. however, my mother insists on connecting
    with me on social media and regularly sends me texts criticizing me for responding
    to family members'' negative comments about my very general and inoffensive status
    updates. she says she''s "disappointed," and then she and dad threaten to not
    pay for the wedding. after a recent argument, she threatened to drop me from their
    health and car insurance. abby, i''m tired of them holding these things over my
    head. visiting has become awkward because of their threats. it feels like i''m
    not welcome in my own family. when i offer to take care of these things myself,
    my parents act as though i''m being ridiculous and retract their threats. i have
    threatened to elope with my fiance to alleviate these issues. i don''t want to
    be estranged from my parents, but i can''t change who i am as a person and what
    i believe. how can i deal with this in a way that doesn''t make me as childish
    as they are? -- i am who i am in minnesota'

    yesterday, when i picked my granddaughter "michelle" up from school, she asked
    me to take her to get a pizza. i told her i had no money, and she responded that
    she had her own money. she then pulled $40 out of her pocket. michelle is only
    9 and has no job. when i asked where she got the money, she told me, "a little
    boy who''s disabled gave it to me." i didn''t believe her story, and after i questioned
    her further, she confessed that she had taken the money from a boy who is not
    disabled. i took the money from her and gave it to her teacher. her teacher said
    the boy had accused michelle, but michelle had sworn she hadn''t taken it. abby,
    my granddaughter not only took his money, but also lied about it. i was devastated.
    when i told my daughter, she said i should have let her and her husband handle
    it because now michelle''s teacher won''t like her and may treat her differently.
    my daughter is now upset with me, but i was just trying to do the right thing.
    did i do the wrong thing? -- hurt grandma in texas'

    do you think parents should intervene in arguments between 10-year-olds? my daughter,
    "amy," was playing at a neighbor''s house with two other girls and they had an
    argument over something stupid. the neighbor''s daughter, "kathy," started to
    cry, so her mother asked my daughter and the other girl to leave because they
    had upset kathy. afterward, she called and wanted me to punish my daughter for
    upsetting hers. i didn''t do it because i think 10-year-olds are old enough to
    make amends with each other. when amy explained the situation, i concluded that
    kathy started to cry because she didn''t get what she wanted. the girls were playing
    with each other again two days later. this isn''t the first time this has happened,
    but it''s annoying because they make a big deal out of it. kathy is an only child
    and we have three children. what do you think about this? -- amy''s mom in antwerp,
