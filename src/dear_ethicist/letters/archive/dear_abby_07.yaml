    several years ago, on the johnny carson show, jimmy stewart read a beautiful poem
    that he had written about his dog named beau. i loved that poem, not only because
    it expressed my own feelings about the dog i once had, but because his name was
    also beau. i have tried to find that poem, but no library has it, and i have no
    idea where to look. can you help me? or am i barking up the wrong tree? (smile.)

    this concerns "desperate in skokie," the woman who had lied about her age for
    years. you advised her to "come clean"-starting with the people at social security.
    i wish you had included what to expect from the people at social security, because
    there must be an army of women who have falsified their year of birth on job applications,
    insurance documents, etc. it was not done for the sake of vanity-it was a matter
    of survival in the job market where age discrimination is rampant at all levels.
    however, come retirement age, the chickens come home to roost. what legal problems
    will those of us who have lied about our ages encounter when we "come clean" to
    social security, insurance companies and banks where we keep our iras? obviously,
    we are afraid to ask for fear of attracting attention to ourselves. i know of
    a man who shaved 10 years off his age 20 years ago to land an executive position
    when he was 55. he is now 75, and only now can he retire and apply for social
    security, withdraw from his ira, join medicare, etc., because once you make yourself
    "younger," it goes on all your documents, and you are stuck! i am one of many
    who is sailing under "younger" flags, nearing retirement age. your response would
    be greatly appreciated. nervous in boston'

    in my dining area that seats only four people comfortably. i have service for
    only four in china, crystal and silverware, as well as a set of four hand-embroidered

    potatoes and four baked alaskas. an hour before my guests were due to arrive,
    mary phoned to say that "cliff," a friend of theirs whom they know i dislike intensely,
    had dropped in on them, and could they bring him along to dinner? i told mary
    that i could accommodate only four at my table, and not to bring cliff. she stammered
    a bit and said she''d call me back in a few minutes. a few minutes later, my phone
    rang. this time it was john. i couldn''t believe my ears when he said, "if we
    can''t bring cliff, we''ll have to take a rain check." i told john that bringing
    cliff was out of the question, and with that i canceled my dinner. abby, after
    a friendship of more than 30 years, mary and john are no longer speaking to me.

    i am a woman in my late 30s, recently divorced after a nine-year marriage. i have
    been told i am attractive, personable and marriageable. so what''s my problem?
    a year after my marriage, i learned that i had herpes! my world came tumbling
    down. i had been a faithful wife, and the only way i could have gotten herpes
    was from my husband. he finally admitted that he had had mild symptoms when he
    met me, but didn''t think it was anything to be concerned about. it wasn''t easy,
    but we were able to live with it. after nine years of marriage, my husband told
    me he wanted to be "free," so we were divorced. as soon as our divorce was final,
    he remarried-so i suspect he had a lady waiting in the wings. it has been two
    years, and i am having a hard time dealing with being single and having herpes.
    i hurt, knowing that no man will want to marry me knowing i have herpes. i have
    avoided forming any serious relationships for this reason. i feel totally alone,
    but i''m sure there are others in the same boat. could some of your readers who

    would you tell a reader with a broken arm how to set and cast it? if not, why

    law for only four years, and thus far i''ve come across the following: 1. a prominent
    texas physician left handwritten notes all over town detailing how his affairs
    should be handled after his death. he had separated from his wife 13 years prior
    to his death, but since they were never legally divorced, she received one-half
    of his estate. in addition to this community property interest due to texas law,
    his will left her one-half of his entire estate. if he had known that she was
    to receive one-half as her community interest, he would not have given her one-half
    of his half community interest-or a total of three-fourths of the entire estate!
    2. another client''s mother died. her handwritten will left everything to her
    husband-my client''s father, who died nine months later, leaving everything to
    my client and his two sisters. the total estate and inheritance tax amounted to
    more than $100,000. the taxes could have been avoided entirely if either parent
    had consulted an estate-planning attorney. 3. another individual, trying to avoid
    leaving anything to her only daughter (a drug addict), carefully specified each
    piece of property in her will and which heir was to receive it. however, after
    writing her will, she received a large inheritance from her father. because the
    inheritance was not listed in her will, under the intestacy laws of the state
    of texas, the inheritance passed to her only daughter-clearly not her intent!

    some nice people. then i dropped out. last october, a neighbor encouraged me to
    enroll in another square dance class, and there i met richard-an "angel" (that''s
    what they call dancers who come to help beginners). i liked the way he looked
    and i loved the way he danced so i approached him, just to talk, and before the
    evening ended, he asked me for a date. richard turned out to be the love of my

    as newlyweds, one of the first questions my husband and i are asked is, "when
    are you planning to have children?" our reply is that we are not planning to have
    any children. some typical responses: 1. a shocked "why not?" as though we hate
    children. we do not hate children-we simply do not want any of our own. 2. an
    implication that i am less of a woman because i don''t want children. this offends
    me. it does not necessarily follow that every woman aspires to be a mother. 3.
    the smug suggestion that we will change our minds when we get "older." (we are
    28 and 31 years old.) we have both felt this way, long before we met each other.
    we reached this conclusion independently of each other after much soul-searching.
    otherwise, we would not have gone through the expense and discomfort of a sterilization
    procedure. we realize that we are in the minority, and we are also aware that
    there are countless people who would give their right eye to have children but
    are unable to, but we are not two of them. we did not make this decision lightly,
    and it hurts us to be judged so negatively by others with another point of view.

    a recent letter expressing concern regarding the manner in which a wedding invitation

    men, who are happily unmarried and have their own homes in cities many miles from
    ours. invitations for weddings, graduations and other occasions, as well as christmas
    cards, often come to us with their names tacked on as if they were still children.
    anyone who does not have their addresses could obtain them with a simple phone
    call. instead, we seem to be expected to call them long-distance or write to them
    to relay the invitation or greeting. they, in turn, have made it a practice not
    to attend any function when invited in this manner. their grandmother excluded
    them from her magazine gift subscription list, saying, "that is only for the married
    ones. they can read yours." (no mention was made of the miles between us.) are
    single adults being treated in this manner for the purpose of saving the cost
    of an additional acknowledgment and postage stamp, or is it merely thoughtlessness
    on the part of the sender? or are singles not considered valid social entities

  body: 'dear readers: more than 2.1 million boys and girls between the ages of 5
    and 13 have no adult supervision after school, and many are alone at other times
    of the day and night. busy parents can help ensure their children''s safety and
    put themselves more at ease by showing them how to be more self-reliant. the following
    tips are excerpted from the "i can do it" course for 2d- and 3d-graders from camp
    fire inc. fire safety: if a fire breaks out, yell "fire" to alert others. escape
    from a burning building as quickly as possible. don''t call the fire department
    until after you escape from the house. don''t change clothes or try to rescue
    favorite objects. the firemen can always find them later. remember: the most important
    thing is to get out of the house safely. figure two ways to escape from each room
    in your home. use the second method if the first route is blocked by fire, intense
    heat or smoke. if you live in an apartment building, be sure you know where all
    the fire exits are. never use an elevator to escape because it could stop running
    and trap you. agree on a specific place outside the house where family members
    can gather after an escape. telephone calls: never tell anyone that you are alone.
    if you do not know the caller, say, "my parents can''t come to the phone right
    now-who''s calling, please?" if a call is scary or threatening, hang up immediately.
    keep the number for the police in plain sight near the phone. if necessary, dial
    "o" for the operator. give the exact location to emergency personnel: know your
    address, telephone number, the nearest cross streets and some landmarks so you
    can give directions. always stay on the line in case dispatchers have questions.
    other: in the kitchen, always turn pot handles toward the inside of the stove
    to prevent accidents. never use knives that are too sharp, and always cut away
    from your body, in case the knife slips. always use pot holders if you are cooking
    something on the stove, and never leave the oven door open. always keep a flashlight
    in one special place in case a storm knocks the lights out-and check the batteries
    regularly. never open the door to a stranger. stay quiet and call a neighbor or
    the police if the person does not go away. always stay calm in a medical emergency.
    call a neighbor or the police if you cannot take care of it yourself. when you
    are home alone at night, always keep the lights on inside and outside the house.
    to keep from being frightened when you are home alone, watch a favorite comedy
    or light entertainment on television instead of a scary movie. keep the tv volume
    on low, so you can hear if someone tries to break in. two common problems are
    nosebleeds and bumps. if you get a nosebleed, sit down and tip your head forward
    slightly (not back), pinch the nose and apply ice until the bleeding stops. do
    not blow your nose. if you get a bump in a fall, lie or sit down and use cold
    water or ice to reduce the swelling. those who want to learn more about the course
    may call their local camp fire council or write the national council: 4601 madison

    negligible chin and only a few desperate wisps of hair-more like bug feelers-above

    white linen suit, agrubby polo shirt and unwashed tennis shoes, chris elliott
    is mister boffo come to life. the geek with chic. nobody in the highly hip pedestrian
    flow from water tower to bloomingdale''s appears to notice that here strolling
    the very same crosswalk with them is the famously famous regulator guy, conspiracy
    guy, panicky guy, and the man who lives under the seats on late night with david
    letterman. nobody. "chris elliott, stand back please! stand back! stand back!"
    says chris elliott. nothing. it is just as well. elliott is simply not himselves
    on this friday in chicago. there is no menace in his bloody-edged eyes, very little
    super hip humor evidenced in his words. he just does not seem to be a cutting-edge
    kinda guy, the kinda guy who would barge onto a hyper-cool and borderline-cruel
    late night talk show and drool like a man gone mad for the opportunity to be on
    television. on letterman, elliott is funny in the way that jack nicholson in "the
    shining" was funny. you laugh as you back away. (ha-ha, heel-toe-heel-toe.) he
    is also funny because he dares to put letterman on while letterman is putting
    everyone else on. he is even more hip-without-trying than letterman is hip-without-trying.
    he is everyman of the television generation, and everyman wants to be on the tube.
    the ultimate dream of the television generation is to have a television movie
    made of your life while you are still young enough for a cameo role as your own
    friend. or to be featured on "lifestyles of the rich and famous," supine on the
    divan. also, maybe, to have oprah put her arm around you and tell you she understands
    while she reads a cue card behind your neck. a smaller-than-life hero elliott
    is a hero of the small screen. his success story is already the stuff of legend.
    he swears it is more than that. he swears it is truth. after high school, he became
    a tour guide at the rca building in new york. one day, david letterman, who at
    the time was a guest host on "the tonight show," showed up to take a tour of the
    observation deck. young elliott lost his cool. he sold letterman a kiddie-price
    ticket. he also told him right away who his father was, the famous bob of bob
    & ray. letterman was cordial. he said he would like to have the comedy team on
    his show someday. "for some reason, i said, `my dad doesn''t do `the tonight show''
    unless johnny hosts it," elliott recalled. letterman said that if his dad changed
    his mind, he''d be glad to have him on. "i felt like such a jerk, said elliott."
    two years later, the producer of "late night" hired elliott as a gofer for the
    show, unbeknownst to letterman. the show was just getting started, was not yet
    the hottest thing on the air, and chris elliott worked his way up to auditioning
    animals for the show''s "stupid pet tricks" segment. since he hated animals, he
    often did it over the telephone. somewhere along the line, he and letterman established
    a rapport. brothers in smartypantshood. chris began getting bit parts on the show,
    starting in 1982, often as a weirded-out member of the studio audience or as a
    studio technician run amok. in 1985, he became an official full-time writer for
    the show, and gleefully began writing himself into as much of it as he could.
    that bold stump. "it got to the point where i couldn''t think of writing stuff
    for dave without writing for myself," confessed the television guy. he now writes
    only to put himself in the show, working three days a week in the manhattan office
    occupied by letterman''s staff and 13 writers. he married paula niedert of waterloo,
    ia., who was letterman''s talent coordinator until elliott stole her, too. they
    have a daughter, abby, though he wanted to call her "dave." "david letterman is
    basically my lifeline to this business and that show is my life. i didn''t go
    to college. i got on `late night'' three years after high schoool. i met my wife
    there. i wonder if my kid would be around if dave hadn''t gotten his own show.
    "i just hope ten years down the line, i can stop thanking him," he said, kissing-up
    with skill and cunning. elliott has lived the dream, is living the dream. he invades
    letterman''s show, takes it captive, sometimes in oversized wigs that are obviously
    a joke. . . or are they? is he crazy or is he not? you are never quite sure with
    the chris elliott on "late night." it''s a joke, dad but on this day in chicago,
    there is little of the zany madcap television guy in evidence. elliott is on the
    final day of a three-week tour hyping his latest put-on "daddy''s boy" (delacorte,
    $12.95), a nonsensical take-off on "mommy dearest" and all the other recent sagas
    unleashed by bent saplings grown up in the shade of mighty oaks. publisher''s
    weekly noted that some of the humor in the book is "strained." "pureed," might
    be a better choice, but for a project whipped out during the television writer''s
    strike just in time to go on sale for father''s day it makes for just as good
    a gift as, say, a rechargeable bathtub regrouter, or a moustache makeover kit.
    nice marketing ploy, though, chris. thank you. besides being on television when
    most other people who look like him aren''t, elliott''s other major talent is
    being the son of the aforementioned bob elliott, half of the famed and enduring
    bob & ray comedy team. from that single bit of genetic serendipity, the son has
    fathered a book of lies. in fact, none of the things written about his own father
    in the book are true, except for the following: - bob elliott did collect jim
    beam decorative decanters. but he really only had three. - he does wear gold toe
    socks (and the family is willing to do commercial endorsements, should anyone
    ask). - he does use mum deodorant. - he did once buy a pair of inflatable undershorts
    through the u.s. mail. "growing up with him was hell," said chris the insincere
    guy. "i only hope this book will encourage other daughters and sons of famous,
    or even unfamous, people to write books about them." father bob, who offers insincere
    rebuttals to each chapter in the book, started out with the tour, but then he
    booked out to film his part in a movie, "quick change," in new york with bill
    murray, who was kind enough to plug the book on "the tonight show" with johnny
    carson the night before chris appeared to absolutely no fanfair on michigan avenue.
    had he not had the movie commitment, bob, 66, (whom several radio and television
    interviewers addressed as "ray"), would probably have taken a hike anyway. "it
    was the most time we spent together in 10 years, and he had forgotten that i spill
    things a lot. i spilled on him. he was soaked bad when he left," said chris, 29.
    (insider''s note: he spits when he talks, too. globules.) the son marched on alone
    on the book tour, where he endured talk show hosts trying to be funnier than him,
    interviewers who called him "chris wright" and a newspaper reporter who sneezed
    on him (globules), repeatedly. and also there was the woman interviewer at cnn
    who pulled out a long pretzel, stuck it in her mouth and tried to be funny as
    "freuda," a psycho psychoanalyst. father looked at son. son looked at father.
    "we thought, `what the hell are we gonna do?'' " by the final day in chicago,
    chris had been rode hard and put away wet, as they say on the dude ranch. he has
    also done some heavy spurring himself, causing great anguish in his publisher''s
    publicity office by cutting appearances from his schedule in each city. "he has
    made enemies for us across the country," said one publicist through her teeth.
    the trouble began on the first stop in toronto, when an overambitious publicist
    scheduled 11 interviews in one day for elliott and his father. after that numbing
    experience, father and son turned into human machetes. they even axed roy leonard''s
    wgn show in chicago, which just is not done, particularly since leonard is generally
    one of the best-prepared interviewers around. they also tried to slip out of an
    appearance on radio station wlup, "but the station said they would trash us all
    day on the air if he didn''t show, so he''s going to do it," said the publicist,
    through her bloodied knuckles. in the end, all elliott really wanted to do was
    get on a plane at o''hare international airport and go home to the house in connecticut-rather
    than the apartment in manhattan-to be with daughter abby on her 2d birthday. autographing
    bananas america has taken chris elliott and wrung him out like the old towel it
    keeps under the kitchen sink for major plumbing disasters and naughty pet spills.
    but did he play the star? naw. he was just a regular, sort of really, unattractive,
    typical guy. at kroch''s and brentano''s book store on wabash, he was truly and
    humbly taken aback, way back, to find one hundred mostly-normal people (and a
    few savage beasts) standing in line awaiting his autograph. at least two of them
    brought bananas for him to autograph. one fellow stood in line for 45 minutes
    to tell chris elliott that people say he looks like chris elliott. he did, with
    more, that is to say, some, hair. the hirsute look-alike kept reappearing around
    the store, sparking rumors of a possible attempted body-double switch. it never
    went down, apparently. after patiently and graciously-except for the numerous
    misspellings and cross-outs-signing nearly 200 books and thereby propelling his
    work of friction into the chicago best-seller list, elliott said he hopes never
    to leave the letterman fold. strictly small screen the movies don''t appeal to
    him. he is strictly a small screen kinda guy, even though his recent stint as
    "spin" on "nick and hillary" was, well, received. the show was canceled. having
    his own show might not be bad, elliott said, if he could keep it small and maintain
    the cult (there have been reports of human sacrifices) following that tracked
    him around chicago last week. although he flopped on upper michigan avenue, bob
    elliott''s legitimate son was recognized by a guy on the pay telephone in the
    grant park parking garage, and a couple people near the crate & barrel on wabash,
    and some tourists from wisconsin in a passing car. "i like to think it''s because
    i''m good-looking," said chris. "but i know it''s because they want to be on television,
    too." caption: photo (color): chris elliot: david letterman''s sidekick, tv''s

    call the neighbor mr. jones.) he said he would keep an eye out for it in the spring
    after the snow melted. well, yesterday bonnie bumped into mrs. jones in the drugstore,
    and guess what she was wearing on her finger? bonnie''s ring! bonnie said she
    was too flabbergasted to say anything to mrs. jones at the time, but our problem
    is how to handle this. to complicate matters, mr. jones is a deputy sheriff with

    body; therefore, why not use some of the body parts to help continue to house
    other souls? after all, our bodies were created from dust and so to dust they

    with strangers in a strange place? at that age, they can''t understand what''s
    happening. they can''t even be sure that their parents will come and get them.

    whether this is true or not, i cannot say, but it has an important message, so
    use it if you wish: "several worldly-wise teen-agers were chiding one of their
    group because of her virginal status. she took it good-naturedly for a while,

    my husband''s brother and his off-again, on-again live-in girlfriend were visiting
    us one evening. during the visit, i was stunned when this woman asked my husband,
    who is 32 years old, "what would you do if you were 21 again, and knew you were
    going to be married and have three children 11 years later?" he answered, "i''d
    get a shotgun and blow my head off!" abby, i thought we had a good marriage. i

    this concerns the letter from the woman who stayed on her side of the bed for

    just like him. he came to stay with me for two months last summer and never took
    one bath or shower in all the time he was here. i kept checking the towels and
    washrag every day, and he never used one! i changed the sheets and pillowcases
    on his bed every week and had to hold my nose while i carried them to the washing
    machine. (i used to sneak into his bedroom while he was sleeping so i could get
    his socks and underwear to wash them.) this man dressed up like a sport and looked
    clean, but he was anything but. he splashed a lot of cologne and after-shave on
    himself, so he must have known that he needed it. i gave him some deodorant, but
    he didn''t get the hint and never touched it. why do some folks just hate to bathe?

    in all the summertime warnings about the dangers of swimming pools, i have yet

    know how to swim? a friend of mine returned home recently from a golf game to
    find two heavy coffee tables, two deck chairs and a chaise longue in his swimming
    pool! his elderly parents, nearly prostrate, were resting-speechless-on the lawn.
    his father, an alert and active 80-year-old, for whatever reason had toppled into
    the pool. his mother, a tiny 85-pound woman, who, like her husband, had never
    learned to swim, had frantically pushed into the pool all the nearby deck furniture
    and, crawling on one piece to another, her husband was able to huff and puff his
    way safely out of the water. a swimming pool life hook (shaped like a shepherd''s
    staff) is so easy to use, even a child can scoop up and pull an adult to safety.
    one should always be on hand. should a life hook be unavailable, pushing a "staircase"

    we recently wrote about doug. he felt his wife, bonnie, had trapped him into marrying
    her and then trapped him into staying by becoming pregnant. although he wanted
    desperately to get out of his loveless marriage, he was afraid of the effect a
    divorce might have on his children. he was contemplating an affair as a way to
    add some spark to his life. many of you suggested that since bonnie''s parents
    were alcoholics, she or doug or both of them should attend meetings of acoa, a
    support group for adult children of alcoholics. here are some of the other responses:
    - bonita: "i am a 13-year-old girl. don''t worry about the hurt your children
    will receive. the faster you get the divorce, the easier it will be for them.
    my parents were divorced and both are remarried. my life has been made better
    by their wise decision." - gwen: "get involved in your church and your children''s
    school. visit nursing homes, be a big brother. believe me there is more heartache
    in divorce than in marriage. an affair is out, you''ll only end up hating yourself.
    i''ll be married 60 years in september. we had good times and bad, but we faced
    them all together and our memories are precious. hang in there, doug. it''s worth
    it." - sarah: "i was in the same position as you. i, too, felt pressured into
    marriage. when our five-year anniversary arrived, i faced the same decision as
    you: have children to light a spark in my dreary, sexless relationship or get
    a divorce. i chose divorce, escaped and have never regretted it. i lost 75 pounds
    and dyed my hair a daring red. you feel used, doug. i know from experience that
    this feeling never goes away. it only ripens with age." - eileen: "staying together
    for the sake of the children is ludicrous. they''re no better off in a loveless
    home that is intact than with a single parent. try for sole custody. it''s not
    as difficult to find a wife when you have kids as you may think. there are plenty
    of women who are watching their biological clocks tick away who would like nothing
    more than marrying into a ready-made family." - beverly: "doug, you are trapped,
    not by bonnie, but by your own values, experiences, and education which have programmed
    you to make the choices that caused your situation." - carol: "everyone deserves
    to love and be loved back. choose your destiny. don''t let someone who doesn''t
    even love you do it." - dorothy: "adult children of alcoholics, like bonnie, often
    have intimacy problems. they may have deep fears of rejection, low self-esteem,
    and buried anger. they are often either not in touch with their feelings or afraid
    of expressing them." - abby: "i''m the `affair'' in a doug-like situation and
    i feel i can help the poor soul. dear doug-please follow this one simple step:
    get a backbone. get out now and find someone who will love you and want to share
    your life. you will be a much better father with a loving wife by your side. if
    you stay in this marriage, you are doomed to a lonely and miserable existence.
    for your own sake, don''t be a martyr any longer." - christine: "my heart goes
    out to you. as a child of divorced parents i can attest to the damage it does.
    but i have grown up, and with age comes understanding. if the divorce can be friendly,
    then i think you have that option. i also believe that should be a last resort.
    it is clear you have not learned to communicate with bonnie and need help in doing
    so. if bonnie won''t go, try it on your own. if you want to change a situation,
    you must begin with yourself." ---------- what part do gifts play in your relationship?

    i''ve been reading your column for years, but when i read the letter from "mom"

    at night to help her relax, i had to respond. i am also a mother of two, and they
    are 13 months apart. although they are now 7 and 8 years old, i remember those

    or three times a week with her. i thought she was crazy! if i was dead tired by
    the evening, where would i get the energy to exercise? well, i tried it, and found
    it a great escape for a couple of hours. i worked off all my frustrations, and
    i actually had more energy during the day than i had before. i slept great at
    night, had more patience with the kids, and improved my figure in the bargain!

    i would like to thank the person who sewed two pennies in the lining of a silk
    suit i purchased to wear to the funeral of my beloved mother. she passed away
    last january. we were very close, and talked on the phone or saw each other every
    day of our lives. during the funeral services, my sorrow was beyond comprehension.
    when i jammed my hand into the pocket, i felt something in the lining. i finally
    worked out the two pennies someone had sewn in there to wish a stranger good luck.
    it gave me such a wonderful feeling, i had to smile through my tears. may i use

    my husband and i are in our early 60s. about a year ago, i found out my husband
    was seeing a younger woman. he said there was nothing serious between them and
    he promised he wouldn''t see her again, so i forgave him. since then, i learned
    that he had never stopped seeing her. in fact, he loaned her a large amount of
    money. he still insists that he loves me and this woman means nothing to him.
    should i confront the woman and tell her i am aware of what is going on between

    hand-delivered invitations and thank-you notes from people trying to save a little
    money on postage. we live in a small town, so it''s easy to drive or walk over.
    my husband and i received a wedding invitation in the mail. we bought an expensive
    gift and attended the wedding. (i had also attended a bridal shower-to which i
    brought a very nice gift.) yesterday, i went into a store owned by the bride''s
    mother to buy a few things. i was handed one thank-you note for my wedding and
    bridal gift combined. she had an alphabetical file box with thank-you notes for
    everyone who had given her daughter a gift, and she handed them out whenever one
    of the guests came into the store. the last straw was when she gave me a thank-you
    note to a friend of mine-and asked me to deliver it if i should happen to run
    into her! i felt that if either the bride or groom could not have handed out the
    notes themselves, they should have mailed them. what do you think? disgusted in

    is afraid of anything new, so i wouldn''t even consider flying him in a plane.

    i am a 29-year-old woman with two children who live with me. my "ex" lives in
    another state. i left him voluntarily five years ago, and do not receive any child-support
    money from him, mainly because i have never pursued the matter. i am doing well
    financially and don''t need support payments. here''s the problem: strangers continually
    ask me whether or not i''m receiving child support from my ex-husband. when i
    tell them no, they proceed to "educate" me on my "rights." abby, there are many
    good reasons why i don''t go after my "ex" to pay up, but they all boil down to
    this: i simply don''t need the money because i have enough of my own, plus it
    wouldn''t be worth the hassle to court-order a few pitiful bucks out of him. how
    do i diplomatically deal with this question? total strangers whom i''ll probably
    never see again, i quickly brush off. but people affiliated with the workplace
    are another matter. i don''t want to share my life history-and i don''t want to
    lie and say i do get child support. responses such as, "that''s personal" and,
    "why do you ask?" are simply not my style. please tell me what to say to those
    nosy folks without lying, explaining or alienating myself. impatient with inquisitors

    my wife, an attorney, seems more loyal to her profession than to me. i work at
    home, while she works downtown with her partner. we earn about the same income.
    here''s the problem: my wife works six days a week. her schedule leaves her so
    exhausted that she has created "rules" about the time we can spend together. i
    am not allowed to have breakfast with her, since she eats breakfast with her partner.
    she eats lunch downtown, and either eats dinner downtown or skips it. i am not
    allowed to plan any activities with her on week nights, and am allowed one weekend
    activity, which cannot last for more than three or four hours. i do most of the
    housework, in addition to working full time. don''t ask about kids; we have sex
    every two or three months, if she''s not too tired and doesn''t have the flu or
    a backache. on sunday of our first anniversary, she stayed home so we could celebrate.
    but between 8:30 and 10 that morning, she had four phone conversations with her
    partner (who knew it was our anniversary). although i told her i didn''t like
    his constant intrusion, she refused to communicate any displeasure to him. finally,
    i blew up, phoned him and ordered him to leave us alone for the rest of the day.
    then she called him up and apologized for my behavior! she refuses to make any
    change in her work hours; in fact, they are growing longer. i understand that
    her partner works long hours and demands the same of her. a reduction might jeopardize
    their partnership. but what about our marriage? am i "inconsiderate" to resent
    her rules, and want more of her time and loyalty? stumped in skokie'

    i''m planning my wedding and have encountered a problem that seems to be common
    among recent brides. my parents, who have limited funds, are paying for my wedding,
    so we sent invitations to those we wanted, and we included a response card. to
    our surprise, many of the response cards came back with "and friend" written in-also,
    some of the couples had added "and children." it was very awkward having to telephone
    these people to tell them we couldn''t accommodate their "friend" or children.
    and can you believe that some people were angry? i suppose because the response

    my 6-year-old niece (i''ll call her nancy) caused a scene in the grocery store.
    she hit her grandmother on the back as they stood in the checkout line. grandma
    had bought nancy a treat that she had wanted to be put into her own shopping bag,
    but grandma put the treat in her own purse instead, so nancy hit her and said,
    "i wanted it in my own bag, i said!" she was marched out of the store and given
    a slight slap and a stern talking-to for her actions. my niece agreed that she
    would never do it again and was given her treat. my question is: should this scene
    be banished from conversation in front of other family members? the child''s grandmother,
    who happens to be my mother, thinks that since nancy doesn''t want anyone to know
    (probably from embarrassment and guilt), no one should mention it. i believe that
    since when one grows older, one''s crimes are printed along with one''s name in
    the newspaper, children should learn early in life that unacceptable behavior
    should not be hidden. i also believe that a little ostracism is very effective

    felt doing this, but she kept pressuring me until i gave in. that wasn''t the
    first time she pushed me into doing something i really didn''t want to do. well,
    the next day, our teacher called us both in and told us that he knew what we had
    done, so he was giving us both f''s, which brought my hard-earned a down to a
    c! he then asked lisa if she had pressured me into giving her the answers, and
    she lied, saying, "no, i just asked for a little help, and she gave me some."
    before this happened, all my grades were mostly a''s and a few b''s. this f is
    really going to bring down my grade-point average. also, the man who teaches this
    class is my favorite teacher, and he said i really let him down. how can i earn

    this problem may seem insignificant to you, but it''s important to me. when i

    control my feet. toes tapping, fingers snapping-up and away onto the dance floor
    to twist the night away. my friends tolerated this compulsive behavior and nicknamed
    me "louie the twister." it was laughable when i was in high school, but what would
    they say now, knowing that i still can''t stop twisting when the music starts?

    my old classmates. however, i''m embarrassed to say that i haven''t changed my
    style of dancing; i still love to do the twist. should i go and risk humiliation?

    i just read the letter from "disgusted in virginia," who is upset by a day-care
    facility''s policy that children not picked up by 6:30 p.m. are taken to the child
    welfare authorities. you thought that was terrible! what''s so terrible about
    it? obviously you have never been in the day-care business. well, i have, and
    you wouldn''t believe how irresponsible some mothers are. my day-care hours were
    from 7:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., but one mother brought her 2-year-old child here
    at 6 a.m. without even calling me first. she was on her way to the airport and
    was leaving town. she said "someone" would pick up her child at 5:30 that evening.
    when nobody came for the child, i tried to reach the two numbers i had on the
    child''s record. one was the child''s grandmother. i called, and that phone had
    been disconnected. the other was a "friend." i called, and the person who answered
    the phone said there was no one there who knew anything about a child in day-care
    so i must have dialed a wrong number! what was i to do? i didn''t have the heart
    to take the child to a welfare facility and leave her with strangers, so i kept
    her with me overnight. (her mother left no clothes-not even a clean diaper!) she
    picked the child up around noon the following day with the usual excuses-her car
    broke down, she wasn''t near a phone, she was unavoidably detained, etc. as you
    might have guessed, i am not in the day-care business anymore. i don''t have the

    during my 10 years as a day-care provider, i have heard every excuse in the book
    for not picking up a child on time. (the prize was a woman who was supposed to
    pick her child up at 3 p.m.; she came at 11 p.m.-saying she''d had drop-in company
    and couldn''t get rid of them!) while waiting for people to pick up their children,
    i have missed dental appointments (which i had to pay for), my daughter''s piano
    recital, my son''s no-hitter and the funeral of a dear friend, not to mention
    countless meetings, hair appointments and manicures. i have tried charging overtime,
    but charging is one thing, and collecting is another. it''s sad to see how upset
    and anxious these children are when they have to wait an hour or two for their
    pick-ups. it wouldn''t be so bad if their moms would call to say they would be
    late, but most of them never bother to call, and the kids are wondering if their
    mom''s been in an accident, had to work late or, worse yet, just forgot them.
    about money: there are women who always forget their checkbooks, and others who
    are "a little short this week" and will pay me on monday. when i first went into
    the day-care business, i was told (by a woman who was once in the business) to
    get my money up front. that''s a laugh! i wish i had the money some of my clients
    still owe me. i could go on and on, but it''s bad for my blood pressure. i really
    do love children, but some of their parents should have remained childless. also

    getting a divorce! i honestly believe they have taken leave of their senses. they
    have had their differences like all married couples, but they have never separated-not
    even for one day. i can''t imagine what has come over them. dad says that since
    he is 70, if the good lord gives him another five years he wants to live them
    in peace. mother, who is 69, says she feels the same way. i suggested a larger
    apartment with two bedrooms, frequent separate vacations, a trial separation-anything

    want. abby, they have children and grandchildren who love and respect them. how

    of which can be replaced. it seems that a part of my life is gone, and i am heartsick
    over it. i am 60 years old and have had a very happy life. our children are married
    and gone, and there are just the two of us. somehow, i feel that you can help
    me. have you ever lost any of your treasures? and if you have, how did you get
    over it? depressed'

    my husband''s brother is the kind who will walk into your house, head right for
    the refrigerator and help himself. it has always burned me up, but i''ve never
    said anything. the other day, ned did that stunt again. he took out a bowl of
    liver and mashed potatoes i had scraped off everybody''s plates and mixed for
    cat food. i was saving it for my neighbor''s cat, which i am feeding while she
    is on vacation. well, ned made himself a big sandwich of this stuff, got himself
    a beer and seemed to enjoy it. i never said a word until he got all through, and
    then i told him what he ate. i am not going to tell you what happened after that,
    but i laughed so hard i cried. ned isn''t talking to me, and neither is my husband.
    did i do anything so terrible? elsie'

    i''ve been married to a good-looking cross-country truck driver for 10 years.
    i''m not the suspicious type, but friday night he came off the road with two long

    nor his trousers were ripped. when i asked him where he got the scratches, he

    my husband has always been a heavy smoker. (four packs a day for the last 30 years.)

    (which he did, believe it or not) and avoid all excitement. (he was more specific:
    absolutely no fooling around with young girls unless he wanted to die in bed.)

    his wife had an announcement to make. they stood arm in arm, and he said, "we''ve
    had 25 years of marriage. our children are married now, and there is no longer
    a reason to go on pretending our marriage is a success. it has been a failure
    for many years, so we''ve decided that while we are both young enough to enjoy

    my marriage was also over-my husband had gotten dull and boring. so i divorced
    my boring husband and he divorced his chubby wife. oh, yes, we both had children,
    but we explained that we were in love and when they were older they would understand.
    our marriage was a dream come true. no more lying and sneaking around. at long

    filled with modern furniture and old-fashioned guilt. and plenty of doubt and

    tell me that he got tired driving so he checked into this motel to take a little

    practically impotent, and since then i couldn''t ask for a more devoted husband.
    he phones me if he knows he''s going to be half an hour late. he buys me presents,

    i am writing to thank you for saving my life. in december 1973 i weighed 326 pounds.
    if my high blood pressure or heart trouble wouldn''t have eventually killed me,
    i''d have done it myself. i lived with loneliness, depression and despair. i was
    a heroin addict and a 23-year-old divorced mother of three on welfare. i hated
    myself enough to prostitute my body to get money for dope. i suffered humiliation
    after humiliation. (a 300-pound prostitute gets all the sadists and perverts no
    other hooker will take.) i had no self-respect, no hope, no god-no nothing. i
    wrote to you, never expecting an answer. your letter was the first word of encouragement
    i had had in years. you advised me to go to overeaters anonymous. i took your
    advice and went to a meeting in june of ''74. i believed none of it. "these people
    are crazy," i thought. "i''m a fat, ugly junkie, and they''re telling me i can
    get thin and regain my self-respect if i want to!" "no way," i told them right
    out loud. no one threw me out. a beautiful, middle-aged man put his arm around
    my shoulder and said, "come back and listen. try us for 30 days. what can you
    lose?" i didn''t believe him, but i went back, and back, and back. today i''ve
    lost 121 pounds, and i''m still losing. i''m drug-free, and i''m learning to like
    myself. i have a responsible job, a belief in a power greater than myself, and
    the love and respect of my children and people who believed in me when i didn''t
    believe in myself. there is no scale at o.a. they don''t shame you if you backslide.
    they are a group of loving, caring, supportive people who are there to help you
    because they have been helped themselves. after sinking so low, o.a. gave me a
    chance to be what i''ve always wanted to be: a lady. thank you for sending me

    states beef for $550. she weighed 1,000 pounds. (now she is hamburger.) but before
    we sold ann, we bred her and she had a beautiful calf. we named the calf after
    your daughter, margo. it will please you to know that margo is nothing short of
    amazing. usually once a calf is weaned, it is put in a pen. after about 13 months,
    it goes into heat and is ready to be bred. margo, however, was extremely precocious.
    we couldn''t believe it. she broke all records. within nine months she was ready
    to be bred. we have never seen a calf mature so rapidly. she is now pregnant and
    due to deliver in late february. since margo''s offspring will be your grandchild,
    you might want a photo when the calf makes an appearance. we will be happy to
    send one. richard and i send best wishes and look forward to the coming blessed
    event.'

    you were way off base in your response to "mom," who needed a glass of wine in
    the evening to relax after a stressful day. the lady is not necessarily a candidate
    for alcoholics anonymous. two glasses of wine a day actually helps save lives.
    moderate use of alcoholic beverages, especially wine, which is the most moderate
    of them all, is beneficial to the cardiovascular system. it increases the level
    of "good'' cholesterol in the blood, which in turn blocks the formation of "bad"
    cholesterol-the kind that leads to arteriosclerosis and other ills. doctors consider
    wine so beneficial that it is now on the menus of over half the hospitals nationwide;
    it is part of the evening routine at many rest homes because it relaxes people,
    contributes to social interaction, improves sleep patterns and generally cheers
    folks up. until very recently, it was regularly prescribed by doctors as a mild
    sedative. in addition, researchers at the university of california at berkeley
    have recently discovered that red wine contains the largest percentage of "quercetin,"
    the most potent anti-cancer agent known in any food-including broccoli and zucchini.
    in short, wine is good for you. do you have the guts to print the truth? cherie

    i''d been divorced for about a year when another woman persuaded me to go to a
    singles dance. a gentleman asked me to dance. i accepted. in the middle of the
    first number, he leaned over and whispered in my ear, "what''s the name of that
    perfume you''re wearing? you smell just like my dead aunt." with that, he walked
    off the floor. another fellow asked me to dance. the band started off with a real

    my children keep giving me "little things" for my birthday, christmas, etc. i

    one of the tragedies of our society is the near total incapacity of widows to
    perform the simplest home repairs. many single women are on very limited incomes,
    but must shell out precious dollars to hire someone to adjust a doorknob, tighten
    an electric wire, put a new ball in the toilet tank or repair a fence. the parallel
    for males is also true. they know very little about cooking, housekeeping and
    child care. i know a man who just gave up and died because his wife passed away.
    i am sure it was largely because he knew nothing about cooking or housework and
    couldn''t bring himself to learn. when i was a child, my dad taught me the "masculine"
    skills, like carpentry, plumbing, electrical repair, etc., but my mother also
    taught me to cook, clean house, do the laundry, darn socks and even to knit and
    crochet before i was out of grade school. to this day i bless my parents for teaching
    me so many things. no, i have never needed to crochet, but at least i understand
    what women are saying when they talk about it! how can we place too high a value
    on the usefulness and freedom one feels when he can take care of himself, as well
    as be helpful to others? parents should teach their children to be self-sufficient.

    recently i have attended baby showers and bridal showers given by office personnel
    for co-workers. at many of these parties, fellow workers have brought their children.
    these "children" range from infants to age 15. they stay with the main group of
    guests. at a recent baby shower, a 5-year-old took over opening the honoree''s
    gifts. since the mother did not correct her, the rest of us sat in silent shock.
    at another party, siblings fought and demanded attention, which i felt was due
    the honoree. am i old-fashioned? showers used to be considered adult parties and
    children were not included. i feel as if i were robbed. i arranged for sitters

    i just read the letter from that poor woman who was embarrassed when a pharmacist

    be insensitive to their customers'' privacy. i''ve been asked just about every
    question imaginable in front of other customers concerning the five prescription
    drugs i take regularly, including: "is that for low blood pressure or premenstrual
    swelling?" and "what do you take norpramin for, bulimia or depression?" one poor
    woman waiting in a crowd at a different pharmacy was told, "now, do not take these
    pills orally-they''re for vaginal insertion only." at another pharmacy, a man
    was asked whether his lesions had cleared up with his last prescription of zovirax-a
    well-known remedy for herpes. i hope you will print this so that pharmacists who
    recognize themselves will be more sensitive to customers'' privacy. they should

    students how to use a library anymore? and abby, why don''t you ever plug our
    library system? it would make my day to see you answer someone''s letter with,
    "look it up." it might put you out of business, but if you could teach one young
    person how valuable our libraries are, you could consider your job of educating
    the nation well done. a friend of the library.'

    about 12 years ago, my father died and left my sister and me a modest sum of money.
    as part of his will, he also set up trust funds to provide college educations
    for my two children, who were his only grandchildren at the time. shortly after
    dad''s death, my younger sister married, and now she has two children. here''s
    the problem: my sister tries to make me feel guilty because my children-now teen-agers-"have
    it made" for their college educations, while she and her husband will have to
    beg, borrow or scrape together the money to send their kids to college. she says
    dad should have made some arrangements for his future grandchildren. is this ever
    done? guilt-tripped by sis.'

    two years ago, my son and his wife, "joyce," were divorced. they had an adorable

    other words, my son gave his child away! i was allowed to see emily and take her

    i didn''t want to lose my right to see my granddaughter. all of a sudden i was
    told that i wasn''t allowed to see her again! the reason? joyce is expecting another

    sets of grandparents! i am heartsick, but i''m told that there is absolutely nothing
    i can do about it. abby, my heart is broken. when i run into joyce and her children

    shares with our son, and whatever it costs to get through the gate at some parks.

    car, meals or anything else. they aren''t any worse off financially than we are.
    they never go on vacations, so they aren''t able to invite our son anywhere. they
    always thank us when we bring buddy home and tell us he''d never get to go anywhere

    holding hands in public, or bestowing a gentle kiss on the other one is indeed

    my husband and i have been married for eight years. we are both 32 years old.
    for most of our married years, we have had one recurring argument. bill (not his
    real name) wants me to dress a certain way when we go out. he likes to see me
    in tight-fitting mini-skirts, tops with no bra and no underwear. i feel very uncomfortable
    dressed this way in public because i look like a hooker. bill says it turns him
    on. he doesn''t have me dress that way around our friends, only when we go out,
    but i''m always worried that we''ll run into someone we know. he says that if
    i loved him, i would do it just to please him. i wouldn''t mind dressing that
    way at home, but that''s not what he wants. bill keeps trying to mold me into
    his playboy image, and i keep resisting. this problem is causing a lot of resentment
    between us. is there any way we can resolve this problem besides counseling? no

    six months ago, our 22-year-old daughter gave birth to her second son. within
    hours of the baby''s birth, our lives were changed forever. our beautiful and
    apparently healthy grandchild has a condition known as down syndrome. our grief
    was almost indescribable for those first weeks following his birth-and was often
    compounded by thoughtless but well-intentioned comments from friends and relatives.
    we were told: "cheer up, it could have been worse." "sue the doctor!" "look at
    the bright side; maybe the baby won''t live." we were asked, "which side of the
    family is to blame?" and the most ignorant question of all: "are you going to
    keep him?" many friends tried to comfort us by saying, "god sends such babies
    only to special parents." abby, this baby is special, but not because he is handicapped.
    we would have loved him just as much had he been born without down syndrome. time
    has eased our grief and enabled us to let go of the dreams and plans we had for
    this child. new dreams and different plans have taken their place. the birth of
    a handicapped baby is traumatic to the family. friends and relatives can be a
    source of comfort and strength. they should acknowledge the baby''s birth with
    appropriate gifts, cards, letters, etc., as they would for any other newborn.
    if one is in doubt as to what to say, it is best to remain silent. a gentle squeeze
    of the hand or a warm hug can speak volumes. it is my sincere hope that this letter
    will be of some help to those who may find themselves in this frightening and
    unpredictable situation. been there in bridge city, tex.'

    this is a message to those men and women who try to prevent women from entering
    abortion clinics and carry big signs that say, "they kill babies here!" have you
    signed up to adopt a child? if not, why not? is it because you don''t want one,
    can''t afford one, or don''t have the time, patience or desire to raise a child?
    what if a woman who was about to enter a family planning clinic saw your sign,
    then decided not to have an abortion but chose instead to give her baby to you?
    would you accept it? what if the mother belonged to a minority group-or was addicted
    to drugs, or tested positive for aids? why are you spending your time carrying
    a sign? why aren''t you volunteering to baby-sit a child born to a single mother
    so she can work? why haven''t you opened your door to a pregnant teen-ager whose
    parents have kicked her out when she took your advice and decided not to have
    an abortion? as for the taxpayers who resent paying for abortions, who do you
    think pays for foster care, welfare, social workers and juvenile delinquency?
    the taxpayers. let''s talk about something money can''t buy: love. have you ever
    visited a home for abused and unwanted children? have you ever been to juvenile
    hall and seen the children who have committed crimes because they were born to
    mothers who didn''t want them? i''m not thrilled about abortion, but i don''t
    think anyone has the right to tell others not to have one unless he or she has
    done the things i have mentioned above. so, to those carrying those signs and
    trying to prevent women from entering family planning clinics, heed my message:
    if you must be against abortion, don''t be a hypocrite-make your time and energy
    count. hates hypocrites in santa ana, calif.'

    "well, we doctors have to be suspicious of every clue we come across." i then
    said, "excuse me, doctor. this is not a `clue'' to anything, and i resent the

    and fat. my mother took a lot of pictures of me as a child. i was not a very pretty
    sight. fortunately, surgery corrected this condition and enabled me to grow normally.
    i am 18 years old now, and all the misery of my stunted growth and fat body is

    two years ago our son was killed in an accident. he left a wife and two sons,
    ages 4 and 6. within a year, his wife (i''ll call her jane) met a man who moved

    to let the boys call this man "daddy" because we felt there was no lasting commitment

    gets as a widow. meanwhile, my husband and i were always there for jane and the
    boys, and we kept our grandsons every weekend we could get them. three months
    ago, "daddy" left jane and she started to drink too much. last weekend we had
    the boys, and when we brought them back on sunday evening, jane came to the door
    very disheveled with a swollen lip and dark glasses. she looked as though she
    had been in a fight. when i asked what happened to her, she went totally out of
    control and struck me! i hated to leave the boys with her, but since she was so
    hostile, i didn''t want to start anything in front of the boys, so i left. now
    jane refuses to let us see our grandsons. when i call her, she hangs up on me.

    i cut this article out of the american legion magazine several years ago: "the
    four chaplains" "early on the morning of feb. 3, 1943, the u.s. troop transport
    dorchester was wallowing through icy seas off greenland. most of the 900 troops
    on board were asleep in their bunks. suddenly a torpedo smashed into the dorchester''s
    flank. frantically pounding up the ladders, the troops milled in confusion on
    the decks. "in those dark moments of panic, the coolest men aboard were four u.s.
    army chaplains-1st lts. clark v. poling (reformed church of america), alexander
    d. goode (jewish), john p. washington (catholic) and george l. fox (methodist).
    the four chaplains led the men to boxes of life jackets and passed them out with
    boat-drill precision. when the boxes were empty, the four chaplains quietly slipped
    off their own life preservers, put them on four young gis and told them to jump.
    "the dorchester went down 25 minutes later in a rumble of steam. some 600 men
    were lost, but the heroic chaplains had helped save over 200. the last anyone
    saw of them, they were standing on the slanting deck, their arms linked, in prayer
    to the one god they all served." i have often wondered if anyone knows what happened
    to the four young gis who received the life preservers. who were they? the article
    states that although some 600 men perished when the dorchester went down, about
    200 were saved. perhaps a survivor-or a relative or friend of a survivor-will
    read this and write to you. herman powell, calhoun falls, s.c.'

    losses are known as "little" deaths, like moving to a new town, being passed over
    for a promotion, losing a favorite piece of jewelry, etc. we can comfort people

    popular restaurant, a woman who was a close friend of darryl''s former girlfriend
    stopped by our table to speak to darryl. he introduced me as his wife and put
    his arm around me. abby, the friend made no acknowledgment of me. instead, she
    started telling darryl what "sheila," his former girlfriend, was up to. she stood
    there talking about sheila until our food arrived. when she finally left, she
    said to darryl, "i''ll tell sheila you asked about her." abby, he didn''t ask
    about sheila at all-she just started talking about this girl! what should i (or
    darryl) have done or said? bugged in minnesota'

    today i renewed a prescription for 20 pills containing barbiturates. the last

    short. i reported the shortage the first time; today i counted the pills in front
    of the pharmacist. he apologized and said that the pill-counting machine sometimes
    "acts up," which is possible, but the issue here is not the money, and we''re

    when i call my friend on the phone, one of his children (ages 15 and 17) usually
    answers. in answer to my request to speak to their father, i am always asked,
    "may i ask who is calling, please?" this really rubs me the wrong way because
    i figure the child has no business knowing who is calling. it comes across as
    being rude and nosy. i know this is not intended, so i asked my friend if his
    children have been instructed to do this as a form of "screening" his calls. he
    said, "no. it''s because callers often do not leave messages; therefore i''ve
    instructed my children to get their names right away." abby, i think this is faulty
    reasoning, because callers have every right not to leave a message if they choose.
    in answer to the question, "is your dad in?" i think the appropriate answer should
    be either, "yes. just a minute, i''ll get him," or, "no, would you care to leave
    a message?" i''ve explained to my friend twice that i find his present answering
    procedure offensive, but nothing has changed. it is so upsetting to me that i
    now hesitate to call him at home. am i justified in being upset? and how would
    you suggest i resolve this? troubled in ontario'

    when my children were younger, we ate our meals together at the kitchen table.
    because of changing lifestyles and schedules (divorce, the teens working different
    hours, microwave ovens, etc.), our mealtime gradually evolved into taking our
    plates to the living room to eat on our laps in front of the tv. last week, i
    commented about how it was a shame we didn''t eat at the table like "normal" people
    anymore. everyone laughed, and said our eating habits are normal-that most families
    today do eat in front of the television. i argued the point, and they said, "ask

    theresa''s parents aren''t the best in the world. her father drinks quite a bit,

    i''ve been reading your column in the new york post since you started writing.
    i''m 88 years old, have been an american citizen since 1930 and have worked as
    both a musician and printer until three years ago. i''m now retired and collect
    social security and union pensions. now, my reason for writing: i feel that i,
    and other senior citizens, are being discriminated against because a new york
    law prohibits men and women who are over 75 from serving as jurors. last year
    i applied for jury duty in the brooklyn supreme court and was rejected because
    of my age. isn''t that outrageous? surely i don''t need the $12 a day it pays.
    when a man such as the late claude pepper could function brilliantly in the u.s.
    congress until his untimely death recently at age 88, why should citizens be deprived
    of serving as jurors simply because they are more than 75 years old? i am sure
    there are many others like me who could prove, by a physician''s certificate if
    necessary, that they could perform as efficiently as younger people. in all my
    55 years of being an american citizen, i have never missed voting. abby, please

    last year, through operation dear abby/america remembers, your readers sent more
    than 6 million pieces of mail to our troops in okinawa, germany, the philippines,
    iceland, korea, europe and beyond to tens of thousands of young men and women
    in the military stationed abroad and at sea during the holidays. in addition to
    the avalanche of holiday cards and letters, there were homemade brownies, cookies
    and fruitcakes! this year, the pentagon has provided us with a list of ships and
    units ranging in size from five people to 500. wouldn''t it be wonderful if groups
    of caring americans-schools, service groups, business clubs, and perhaps towns
    and cities-would "adopt" a unit for the holidays? imagine how proud the small
    towns across america would be knowing they are taking care of "their" troops across
    the ocean. elementary schoolchildren would work on special class projects, and
    teen-agers would also join in the operations. imagine how thrilled the troops
    would be! i hope that this idea, in addition to the usual operation dear abby
    deluge of mail, proves successful. with deepest thanks to you, your staff and
    your millions of readers for all your love and concern. donald p. grimes, national

    i participated in operation dear abby in 1987, never dreaming what it would lead
    to. (given the odds, i thought my chances for winning the lottery were far more
    favorable than finding a husband!) i lived in cleveland, and cesar was stationed
    in korea. i sent one christmas card with a letter to each of the five addresses
    you printed in your column. that was in december of 1987. the other correspondences
    faded out, but the one with cesar continued, and we really got to know each other
    through our letters and the pictures we exchanged. as luck would have it, cesar
    was relocated to tucson, ariz., in april. this gave us an opportunity to call
    each other as well as write letters. cesar''s leave was scheduled for sept. 1,
    1988, and that''s when he came to cleveland to meet me. our meeting was a dream
    that had come true. we were married six days later-sept. 6. abby, this is the
    best thing that has ever happened to us. i tease him and call him my "mail-order
    groom." how can i thank you? shelly k. davila, mayfield heights, ohio'

    a mother signed "frustrated" asked, "is it rude to invite only my child''s playmate,

    individuals, with separate friends, interests, activities and lives. life isn''t
    always fair or equal, but invitations usually balance out. if one child is consistently
    excluded, it may be because he (or she) has a problem (behavior, personality,

    my husband uses "grounding" for every little infraction our 15-year-old son commits.
    "rick" loves sports, and he''s very good at basketball and soccer. he''s on his
    high school teams for both sports. my husband feels that when rick is grounded
    he should not be able to go anywhere-including practice for sports or playing
    in the games. i feel that taking away rick''s tv and telephone privileges and
    going out in the evening is punishment enough. besides, if rick is grounded from
    practice and playing in sports, he''d be letting his school and teammates down.
    being grounded from sports for two weeks could even cause him to lose out playing
    a whole season. i think i have a fairly good chance of winning this argument,

    you advised a reader who was harassed by obscene telephone calls to report such
    calls to the telephone company. what do you expect it to do for her? i was employed
    by the telephone company as a customer service representative for 25 years, and
    when people complained to us about such calls, we would refer them to the police
    department. the police department would then refer them back to the telephone
    company. of course, customers would feel that they were getting the runaround-which
    they were. the best thing to do is to change your telephone number-and there is
    a charge for that. however, if the calls are life-threatening and a police report
    is filed, the phone company will change your number without charging you for it.
    most people think it''s easy to trace a telephone number. it''s not. it''s a very
    involved procedure, and the telephone company and police department must work
    together in order to trace a call, but this is done only in life-threatening circumstances.
    if the calls are obscene or harassing, the best way to discourage them is to keep
    a whistle near the phone and give the caller an earsplitting blast. old rep from

    please tell your readers about a disease that is fast approaching epidemic proportions.
    it is diabetes. most americans think this disease is controllable and not life-threatening.
    unfortunately, in order to properly treat people with diabetes, they must first
    be diagnosed. statistics reveal that an estimated 11.5 million americans have
    diabetes, but only 6 million of them have been diagnosed and are being treated.
    the many other millions of americans are walking around as virtual human time
    bombs. diabetes, if left untreated, can cause blindness, stroke, heart disease
    and even death! the incidence of diabetes is extremely high in minority groups
    such as hispanics, blacks, native americans and asian americans. also at risk
    are pregnant women and women who have given birth to babies of 9 pounds or more,
    people over 50 and those with a family history of diabetes. to reach the millions
    of americans with undiagnosed diabetes, the american diabetes association is launching
    a public education program called, "diabetes. take the test. know the score."
    the campaign is designed to urge all adult americans to take a simple blood test
    that can determine diabetes quickly and early, when it can be treated easily.
    it''s surprising that in the health-conscious united states, people are flocking
    to their doctors for high blood pressure and cholesterol tests, yet few understand
    the need to have their blood sugar level tested as well. through your column and
    our education program, we are hoping to eliminate unnecessary health problems
    and even deaths caused by untreated diabetes by encouraging your readers to see
    their doctors. will you help us? sherman holvey, m.d., president, american diabetes

    i recently attended a bridal shower for a friend and gave her two beautiful nightgowns.
    (not cheap, either.) she and her boyfriend became engaged shortly after she found
    out she was pregnant. a week before the scheduled wedding, she called it off because
    she found out her fiance was using drugs heavily, and he told her that he had
    no intention of quitting. she phoned me to tell me the wedding was off, then she
    asked if i wanted my gifts back. i told her she could keep them if she wanted,
    or she could return them for the money, since times would be tight for her with
    the baby coming. should she have kept them or not? i felt she put me on the spot
    by asking me if i wanted them back. what is the correct thing for an ex-bride
    to do in that situation? ex-bride''s friend'

    my husband and i have been very happily married for 14 years and have four children.
    my problem is my parents, who take frequent vacations and short trips. every time
    they return from one of their trips, they bring some kind of gift for each of
    our children and me-but there''s never anything for my husband. although he has
    never said anything, i can tell he feels hurt. i would prefer that my parents
    bring presents for the children only and nothing for me if they can''t bring something
    for my husband. my parents are very loving and generous people, but i''m afraid
    if i tell them how i feel, they might think i am ungrateful. what do you think,

    read this letter, they will remember to bring something for everybody in the family-or
    nothing at all. hurting for hubby'

    many of my friends and relatives of scandinavian origin switch their v''s and

    you had a letter in your column about a woman named jane whose husband was killed
    in an accident and left her with two little boys. the letter said, "jane has no
    intention of marrying again because she doesn''t want to lose the $500 a month
    she gets from social security as a widow." abby, that is a very popular misconception
    held by many women. jane gets $500 from social security because she has two underage
    sons-not "just because she''s a widow." a widow has to be 60 years old to collect
    social security. i know because it happened to me! i was 53 when my husband died
    suddenly. i went right down to the social security office to sign up for that
    nice social security check i thought i was entitled to. after all, my husband
    had worked steadily since he was 17, and he passed away at 55. guess what? i found
    out i was entitled to a big fat zero! i went into shock. needless to say, i had
    to go to work at age 53. thank god i found a pretty good job, and three years
    later i found a man who married me and i didn''t need to work anymore. please
    let women know that social security does not give benefits to widows until they
    are 60 years old. mrs. g.l.w., tempe, ariz.'

    regarding the woman who had a scar on her wrist from having a ganglion tumor surgically
    removed: she became angry when, during a routine physical, a new doctor asked
    her if she had attempted suicide. instead of being angry, she should have thanked
    that doctor for his loving concern. during my entire junior year in high school,
    i had fresh gashes on my wrists. i was depressed over the loss of a friend and
    confused about my identity. having been adopted, i wondered why my birth mother
    had thrown me away. my band teacher, who positioned my hands on the flute, pretended
    not to notice the cuts on my wrists. my mother accused me of injecting drugs.
    my english teacher never asked me why all my compositions were about death and
    suicide. my chemistry teacher never noticed that i had lists of poisons on my
    notebooks. finally, some good, caring friends took me to a counselor who backed
    me into a corner and yelled, "what is wrong with you?" to make a long story short,
    i was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility, put in a padded cell and tested.
    they found that i had a biochemical imbalance. i was treated with anti-depressant
    drugs and psychotherapy, which partially solved my problem. the point i really
    want to make is this: all the signs were there to read, but nobody wanted to read

    the man i started seeing three months ago broke up with me, and i would do anything
    in the world to get him back. here''s what happened: phil and i met through an
    ad i had placed in a newspaper. in the ad i said i was divorced when, in fact,
    i am only separated. we "clicked" the first time we met. when we got to know each
    other better, he said i was the answer to his prayers, and i knew he was the answer
    to mine. then, on the phone one night, i let it slip that i was not actually divorced-only
    separated. he became very angry, saying that our relationship had been based on
    deception; i was a liar, he detested liars, and he wanted nothing more to do with
    me. he said goodbye and hung up. abby, i''ve had nothing to do with my husband
    for five months, and i consider myself divorced, but i haven''t filed yet. i''ve
    called phil, and he won''t even talk to me. i''ve written him letters of apology,
    but he returns them unread. i realize i can''t force him to talk to me or read
    my letters, but he won''t even give me a chance to clear the air so we can pick
    up our relationship where we left off. i am not a dishonest person. i didn''t

    hugging a tree is good advice for youngsters who lose their way in the woods and,
    as one writer suggested, a whistle around the neck is also a good idea for campers.
    but what about toddlers who wander off in a wooded area and are too young to follow
    instructions about hugging a tree? or even blowing a whistle should they get lost?
    my husband and i have been camping in the colorado rockies with our children since
    they were babies, and i have a suggestion for parents who camp out with very young
    children. to keep your children from getting lost, simply remove their "car seats"
    from the automobile and use them as security chairs. infant car seats provide
    comfortable, "escape-proof" chairs that can be placed by campfires, rivers or
    wherever you are on your camping trip. while parents are fishing, erecting a tent
    or preparing meals, with the little ones safely in their escape-proof car seats,
    there is no need to worry about where they are. children under 3 years of age
    do wander, and in hilly, wooded terrain like we have in colorado, only a few minutes
    is all it takes for a youngster to get lost. and sound doesn''t carry very well
    in the mountains. i hope this suggestion will save some toddler the grief of getting
    lost, or some parents the pain of losing a child on a camping trip. sad to say,
    it happens to somebody''s child every year. carolyn reed, denver'

    you recently ran a letter from a widow whose daughters, meaning to be helpful,

    as a rather recent widow, may i comment on those who are carrying on without their
    partners? it gives me much comfort to have my late husband''s pictures around
    me. i "talk" to them. yesterday i even scolded him, saying, "you know i hate being
    alone. why aren''t you here to help me?" i am always pleased when i see my young
    adult son wearing one of his father''s good shirts. (he wore his dad''s favorite
    tie at his recent graduation.) if all those things had been given away, i would
    miss reliving so many happy memories. my husband was an avid sailor and had many
    books on sailing. had i given them to a rummage sale, they would have meant nothing.
    i gave them as gifts to his sailing friends who treasure them, knowing they came
    from a real sailing expert. his notes and comments scribbled in the margin enhanced
    their value. even an old dish that was his is on my desk holding paper clips and
    rubber bands. why should i discard useful objects because they were his and he
    is gone? it''s true, those things can be painful reminders, but one way to get
    over the pain is to keep a few familiar things around to remind me of good times.

    (minn.) times, has now spread to canada, great britain, france, ireland, australia,
    south africa, norway, finland and sweden. last year, more than 18.4 million smokers
    tried to quit for the day. this represents more than 37 percent of the nation''s
    50 million smokers. breast cancer used to be the biggest killer for women. but
    the no. 1 cause of death among women and men today is lung cancer. an estimated
    93,000 men and 49,000 women will die of lung cancer in 1989. and now, a word about
    smoking-related diseases-emphysema, chronic bronchitis and heart disease: this
    year an estimated 390,000 will die from one of these. this total exceeds the number
    of u.s. battle deaths in world war ii; it is eight times as many people who die
    in automobile accidents every year! according to the u.s. surgeon general, there
    are more deaths from smoking in the united states each year than there are from
    aids, heroin, crack, cocaine, alcohol, fire, murders and car accidents combined.
    a congressional study has reported that health costs from the adverse effects
    of smoking have reached a new high of $100 billion a year in increased medical
    bills and lost productivity. the loss in death and disability cannot be measured.
    (and how does one measure the amount of heartache, remorse and guilt suffered
    as a result of a preventable, self-induced tragedy?) what about "secondhand" smoke?
    is it actually damaging to nonsmokers to be in the presence of those who are smoking?
    yes! furthermore, studies reveal that the children of smokers are more prone to
    lung problems and allergies than are children of nonsmokers. for years i have
    begged my young readers, "if you smoke, quit now. if you don''t smoke, don''t
    start!" yet an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 kids light up for the first time every
    day. why? peer pressure, no doubt. quitting "cold turkey" is the hardest way to
    quit, but my readers have told me it''s the most effective, and in the long run,
    the easiest way. cutting down is less traumatic, but the temptation to smoke is
    often too powerful to resist while smoking just one, two or three cigarettes a
    day. those who are heavily addicted may require help to break the habit. call
    your local chapter of the american cancer society for information. so if you''re
    hooked on cigarettes and have been telling yourself, "one of these days i''m going
    to quit," why not start tomorrow? it won''t be easy, but it will be the best thanksgiving
    present you can give yourself-and those who love you. p.s. a favor, please? if
    you quit tomorrow, even for 24 hours, i want to hear from you. then write again
    and let me know how long you were able to stay clean. good luck. keep me posted.
    p.s.s. apropos "thanks for not smoking" signs some folks have in their homes:
    i once saw a sign that read: "if you smoke on these premises, we will assume that
    you are on fire, and you will be treated accordingly." ----------'

    our wedding, my soon-to-be father-in-law suffered a massive coronary. his dying
    wish was that we proceed with our wedding as planned-music, dancing and all, regardless
    of what should happen to him in the following days. he died two days later. it
    was a sad time for all of us, but my mother-in-law insisted that we carry on as
    planned. she said she had had 35 years of happiness with her husband, and she
    wanted us to begin our marriage surrounded by joy-not sorrow. there wasn''t a
    dry eye at the ceremony as she walked down the aisle on the arm of her son. she
    smiled bravely with her head held high, looking lovely in her turquoise gown.
    she had given me the greatest gift possible. last summer she passed away. her
    kindness and generosity at the start of our marriage had set the tone for our
    relationship. for 13 years i valued her friendship and wisdom. and even now when

    she and our son, "rick," took mike to day care, but we three relatives continued
    to receive equal-time baby-sitting many weeknights and weekends. nan would apologize
    if we missed our turn and faithfully made up any missed baby-sitting "privileges."
    we explained to our son, rick, that since my career keeps me extremely busy, we
    need to indicate when we are able to give some time grandparenting. this has worked
    well on the calendar, but not on the issue. i am very resentful because our two-hour
    "visits" with little mike have become overnights that extend to 16 hours! i don''t

    child-that they had their choice of babies, and i was the one they chose. because
    i''ve made no secret of the fact that i was adopted, i''ve had people ask me if
    i know who my "real" parents are. i simply reply, "i know who my real parents
    are. they are the people who fed me, clothed me and taught me right from wrong.
    they are the ones who sat up with me all night when i was sick and waited up for
    me when i stayed out later than i should have. they paid for my education and
    convinced me that i could be whatever i wanted to be. i owe them more than i can

    is thanksgiving, so why not take a few minutes to count your blessings? how''s
    your health? you have a few minor complaints? well, thank god they''re not major.
    obviously you''re still alive. you can probably think of at least one person who
    isn''t around this year. if you awakened this morning and were able to hear the
    birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast
    table on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one),
    praise the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. and say a prayer for those who didn''t
    survive hurricane hugo or the san francisco earthquake. how''s your pocketbook?
    thin? well, most of the world is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food
    stamps. no social security. no medicare. in fact, one-third of the people in the
    world will go to bed hungry tonight. would you rather be in pakistan, ethiopia
    or nicaragua? are you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody
    calls you, pick up the phone and call somebody. go out of your way to do something
    nice for somebody. it''s a sure cure for the blues. are you concerned about your
    country''s future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern. if you don''t
    like your elected officials, you can go to work and vote them out of office. we
    still have the soapbox and the ballot box. freedom rings! you can still worship
    at the church of your choice, or not worship at all if you don''t want to. you
    can cast a secret ballot, and even criticize your government without fearing a
    knock on the head or a knock on your door in the middle of the night. and if you
    want to live under a different system, goodbye and good luck! you are free to
    go. there are no walls or fences to keep you here. as a final thought, i''ll repeat
    my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will want to use it at your table tomorrow:
    o, heavenly father, we thank thee for food and remember the hungry. we thank thee
    for health and remember the sick. we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless.
    we thank thee for freedom and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir
    us to service that thy gifts to us may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful
    thanksgiving, and may god bless you and yours. love, abby p.s. by the way, want
    an instant high? the surest cure for the post-holiday blues is to do something
    nice for someone. why not call someone who lives alone and invite him or her to
    join you for lunch or dinner? better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you,
    and i''ll see that you get home." (many older people don''t drive, and those who
    do don''t like to go out alone after dark.) p.s.s. special greetings to those
    of you in the military who wrote from remote corners of the world to tell me that
    you are using my thanksgiving prayer. ---------- abby''s favorite family recipes

  body: 'dear readers: do you know someone who has cancer? of course you do-everybody
    does. there''s so much of it around these days. it''s bad enough when an adult
    has cancer, but when a child has cancer, you keep thinking, "god has a lot of
    explaining to do." erma bombeck, a warmhearted, enormously talented writer, has
    written a book about kids who have cancer and, in her words, "have every hope
    of beating the odds and living to drive their parents crazy." her ninth best seller
    is titled "i want to grow hair, i want to grow up, i want to go to boise" and
    is published by harper & row. this book came about after erma visited camp sunrise,
    just outside of payson, ariz. it''s a camp for kids who are living with-not necessarily
    dying from-cancer. one day at camp sunrise was enough to propel bombeck into writing
    this book. a sample: "it was your basic camp with musty tents and mosquitoes that
    should have been required to file flight plans. "the ultimate goals of these campers
    were not unlike the ultimate goals of campers everywhere: (1) to use food for
    the purpose for which it was meant to be used-fights; (2) to go home with the
    coveted dry soap award; and (3) to sock it to the staff. the last is deftly accomplished
    through a 60-piece kazoo band at midnight, hanging a nurse''s bicycle from the
    diving board, and planting things in the counselors'' beds that crawl in the night,
    causing them to hyperventilate. "but the differences in this camp were not exactly
    subtle. artificial limbs and wheelchairs were stored in the corner of the lodge.
    several of the campers were bald. a counselor with one leg told me how she visited
    a border town in mexico that had had a rash of car-stripping incidents. so she
    took off her prosthesis and propped it up with the foot showing above the window
    ledge of the van so someone would think the car was occupied. not your basic crime
    fighter, but it worked." then erma writes in some detail about the son of a u.s.
    senator who, due to cancer, had a leg amputated when he was 10 years old. he said,
    "does humor help? well, i was riding on the back of a friend''s bike when we hit
    a bump or something, and my artificial foot was turned around backward. i got
    off, twisted it around the right way, and walked off. the people standing there
    couldn''t believe it." he is 26 now. he''s tall, tanned and robust, graduated
    from wesleyan university in connecticut, and he planted the seeds that would be
    harvested into something that would benefit other cancer patients-an advocacy
    organization called facing the challenge. it''s a civil rights organization for
    people with disabilities. of course by now you must have guessed that the young
    man is ted kennedy jr. i must confess, dear readers, i thought the book would
    be a "downer"-how could a book about kids with cancer be anything but? believe
    me, i was wrong-it was actually an upper. and here''s an interesting publisher''s
    note: "all monies earned by the author from sales of this book in the united states
    will go to the research division of the american cancer society. "all monies earned
    by the author from sales of this book in canada will go to the canadian cancer
    society. "all monies earned by the author from sales of this book outside the
    united states and canada will go to the eleanor roosevelt international cancer

    i am sending this letter to you because of your wide readership, in the hope that
    a direct letter in your column will shake up the public. i have sent a letter
    in the past to the surgeon general and the american lung association, all to no
    avail. it has to do with the annual great american smokeout. each year, i wonder
    anew why the great american smokeout is always held about one week before thanksgiving,
    christmas and new year''s celebrations begin-traditionally some of the most stress-filled
    days of the whole year! does it make sense to try to have smokers quit just before
    a period of constant socializing, partying and traveling? to me, it seems as though
    their efforts will be doomed from the start. i often wonder why it doesn''t occur
    to either the surgeon general or to the american lung association that a far better
    time for a sincere anti-smoking campaign would be around jan. 1, when people are
    in a resolution-making mood and when perhaps they''ve become sick of their and
    everyone else''s smoke during the previous weeks. i am a registered nurse and
    have never been a smoker. it truly bothers me to think that this whole campaign

    time that it is held. frieda h. kvam, r.n.'

    we will join forces with the america remembers campaign, whose national chairman
    is still donald p. grimes. last year, operation dear abby sent more than 6 million
    pieces of mail to our servicemen and women stationed in japan, korea, iceland
    and europe, as well as to those serving in the mediterranean and indian oceans.
    schoolteachers in the united states and canada made classroom projects of writing
    to our servicemen and women who would be far from home during the holidays. men,
    women and children who enjoyed baking sent cookies, brownies and fruitcakes. i
    received hundreds of heartwarming pictures of men and women in uniform, gathered
    around tables on which were piled literally thousands of letters and cards. many
    wrote to describe how everyone frantically searched for envelopes bearing the
    postmark of their hometowns-or states. veterans of world war ii, the korean war
    and vietnam wrote to give our young servicemen and women a lift because they remember
    how sad it was to be half a world away from home over the holidays. last year,
    at least a hundred long-distance romances blossomed through the exchange of pictures
    and letters. this year, more than 200,000 troops will participate in the program.
    please join me in this campaign to let our servicemen and women know that you
    remember and appreciate them. send as many hanukkah and christmas cards as you
    can. in previous years, hundreds of readers wrote to say that they were overwhelmed
    at the responses they received from grateful servicemen and women. write to as
    many as you can. i can''t guarantee that every letter will be answered. last year,
    one ship with only 500 men aboard received 60,000 pieces of mail! here are the
    addresses-take your pick: 1. for the u.s. army in germany (cards and letters can
    be addressed to "dear soldier" or "dear friend"): america remembers the army operation

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a 52-year-old working woman and thought i knew what was going on in the world,
    but i guess i must have missed something. i had always assumed that bridal showers
    were given for brides who were just starting out. this year, i was expected to
    attend several bridal showers and give a wedding gift to a niece who had married
    three years ago-and was divorced last year. i had already attended three bridal
    showers and had given her an expensive wedding gift for her first marriage. she
    wore a white gown again (a different one) and had a big fancy church wedding that
    topped her first one. a friend invited me to a baby shower for her daughter who
    is pregnant with her second child. this mother-to-be has a 2-year-old daughter.
    the sonogram showed that she was carrying another girl. in my day, we saved our
    baby''s clothes for the next child, so why a shower to get more little girl''s
    clothes? also, i thought showers were given by friends-not relatives. and certainly
    not by a mother for her own daughter. a girl at work is finally marrying the man
    she''s been living with for eight years, and i am invited to a shower for her.
    abby, after eight years together, what can they need to get started? wait, there''s
    more: my nephew was married four years ago and was divorced 14 months ago. last
    week, his ex-wife had a baby boy out of wedlock by someone unknown to us. this
    baby has our family''s last name, but he''s not related to anyone in our family.
    either the mother doesn''t know who the baby''s father is, or the father wants
    nothing to do with them. she sent me a birth announcement with a list of items
    the baby could use. how could i refuse? is all this commonplace, abby, or is it
    just the people i know? confused in san diego'

  body: 'dear readers: well, it seems as though we just finished polishing off the
    thanksgiving leftovers, and it''s time to start shopping for hanukkah and christmas
    gifts again. because it''s been such a tragic year for those who lost their homes
    in hurricane hugo or the san francisco quake, you may want to spend less on gifts
    in favor of sending money to the american red cross. and now we have another concern-the
    poor and homeless. however, if you plan on sending holiday gifts, let me tell
    you what not to give aunt bessie or grandpa who doesn''t get around much anymore.
    forget the cologne, after-shave and dusting powder. chances are, they have several
    unopened boxes gathering dust on their closet shelves. grandpa doesn''t need another
    paisley necktie, and grandma doesn''t want any more bracelets, brooches or earrings.
    with the price of groceries going through the roof, older people who live alone
    on fixed incomes would appreciate a basket of practical goodies. how about small
    tins of tuna, chicken and ham? also, crackers, instant coffee, tea, soup mixes
    and cookies. people who live in confined quarters do not need more "things," so
    don''t send music boxes or bric-a-brac. and don''t send articles of clothing unless
    you''re sure the size is right. leisure (or "warm-up") suits are comfy and easy
    to launder. older folks love them. some truly useful gifts: an assortment of postcards,
    some lined stationery with envelopes and a generous supply of postage stamps.
    and enclose some felt-tip pens. another suggestion: a variety of greeting cards
    for all occasions. they might want to send someone a nice birthday, anniversary
    or graduation card. don''t forget get-well cards, condolence cards and "congratulations
    on the new baby" cards. should you be tempted to recycle a lovely, but useless,
    gift still in its original box, make sure the card to you is not still in the
    box. never give a pet to anyone unless you are absolutely certain that person
    wants a pet and is able to care for it properly. and if you want to make a hit
    with someone who has a pet, send a little holiday gift (a tin of dog or cat food)
    along with a gift for its master. don''t give wine or liquor to people unless
    you are sure they imbibe. a thoughtful idea: a gift subscription for a magazine
    or newspaper you know they will enjoy. candy, nuts and fruitcake make beautiful
    gifts for people who aren''t counting their calories, but have a little compassion
    for those who are, and lead them not into temptation. also bear in mind that some
    older folks have difficulty chewing nuts and caramels. another good idea for those
    living alone on a fixed income: a gift certificate for some kind of service such
    as window washing, carpet cleaning, taxi rides, barber shop, beauty parlor or
    dinner or lunch at their favorite place. and (don''t laugh) a gift certificate
    entitling them to a trip to the podiatrist. because medication is no small item
    these days, a gift certificate from the neighborhood pharmacy would be very much
    appreciated. trust me. holidays can be depressing for people who are alone-loneliness
    is the ultimate poverty. so if you know someone who could use an outing, give
    him or her the best gift of all: an invitation to have a meal with you and your
    family. if you "ain''t" givin'', you''re not livin''. love to you and yours. abby'

    my husband and i are the parents of three wonderful, healthy daughters, ages 10,
    8 and 6. following the birth of our third daughter, i had a hysterectomy, so all
    hope of having a son vanished-until we were told that an 8-year-old boy was available
    for adoption. when we met him, we were thrilled to see such a bright and attractive
    boy, and knew immediately that todd (not his real name) would fit right into our
    family. after having todd in our home for five months, we signed the papers and
    the adoption was finalized-and that''s when the trouble began. todd started to
    have violent temper tantrums, screaming, throwing and breaking things, hitting
    the girls and defying all discipline. we immediately took him to a psychiatrist,
    who placed him in a very fine private institution. after three months, todd begged
    to come home, promising to "behave," so we brought him home. after five weeks,
    he started acting up again-lying, stealing, hitting the girls and making all our
    lives miserable. abby, is there any way to abort adoption? we just can''t handle
    this child. an error in judgment'

    i am a 27-year-old mother of three-an 11-year-old daughter, a son who is 9 and
    another daughter who is 10 months old. here''s my problem: my 11-year-old daughter
    is pregnant and is due next month. she doesn''t want the baby. she wants to put
    it up for adoption. with me trying to raise a baby myself, i agreed with her.
    am i wrong to feel this way about my first grandchild? my sisters agree with me.
    we feel that my daughter is too young to handle that kind of responsibility. what
    do i tell the rest of my family and friends when my daughter comes home from the
    hospital without a baby? please answer this soon as it is very important to me.
    i would also like to hear what your readers have to say about this situation.

    two years ago i married a 24-year-old man. i was 34. the age difference didn''t
    matter because he seemed so mature and i loved him. we had a baby a year after
    we were married because we both loved children. he worked for a company 84 miles
    away, and i know he could have worked closer to home. he''s a well-trained professional,
    but he stayed on that job, commuting every day. he didn''t even try to get a job
    closer to home. i got a phone call one evening that explained everything. an unidentified
    man called and told me my husband was having an affair with a woman he worked
    with, and said, "he''s with her right now"-and he gave me her address. i bundled
    up the baby, got into my car and drove to the "other woman''s" house. sure enough,
    my husband''s car was parked in front! i rang the doorbell, but she wouldn''t
    open the door. i waited outside, and 30 minutes later my husband came out with
    his head down. we drove home in separate cars. that night we had a long talk,
    and he promised he would never see her again. (he had been seeing her since before
    we were married.) i gave him another chance, and so far when he comes home, he
    stays home. he says he loves me-and me alone-but i still don''t trust him, and
    my heart is heavy. when he makes love to me, i think he''s thinking of her. i
    guess i really haven''t forgiven him. i suggested we get counseling. he said it
    would be a waste of time and money because he has no intention of seeing this
    woman again. i am going crazy with this on my mind. i''ve kept this bottled up
    inside me because i don''t want my family to give me any advice on what to do-which
    would probably be to throw him out. what should i do? brokenhearted.'

  subject: Clearing the air New Yorkers are debating a measure to keep magazines from
    punching you in the nose.
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    on the theory that many people can''t stand the smell of their magazines and credit-card
    bills, a proposal has been advanced in the state of new york to bar fragrance
    strips from periodicals and mailings unless the samples are sealed. "the only
    hazard new yorkers should face when opening a magazine is a paper cut, not a migraine
    headache or severe asthmatic reaction," said state sen. martin connor, who has
    introduced a bill that would require smell-proof sealants. the bill was debated
    last week in manhattan by chemically sensitive supporters (one of whom testified
    through an air mask) and economically sensitive opponents, representing cosmetics
    makers and promoters with nationwide operations. no one testified from the magazine
    publishers of america, a new york-based association that represents 850 publications.
    but its senior vice president, david b. lee, said after the hearing, "i''m not
    sure we heard anything that would be regarded as specific evidence that magazines
    are causing a health problem. if it now becomes the job of the state to protect
    citizens from odor, where does it stop?" lee asked. felled on a train connor,
    a democrat who represents parts of brooklyn, manhattan and staten island, became
    aware of the potency of fragrances last year when his communications director,
    amy solomon, was felled on an albany-bound train by a woman''s magazine with perfume-scented
    advertising inserts. "by poughkeepsie, i had a raging migraine headache," she
    recalled. connor attracted wide notice when he mentioned his bill in a letter
    to the dear abby column. he received more than 100 letters from people around
    the country who had been traumatized by scent strips. at last week''s hearing,
    richard zachary, who suffers from hypersensitivity, appeared in an air mask. "an
    individual should have the right to decide whether he or she wants to sample a
    chemical product," he said, on behalf of a new jersey-based group called the national
    center for environmental health strategies. "it''s almost ludicrous to think of
    an aspirin sample reaching our bloodstream without our knowing about it," zachary
    said, "yet that is what happens with the molecules from fragrance samples." connor''s
    bill may be amended as a result of the hearing, and industry representatives evidently
    hope that the bill will be amended out of existence. risk is disputed "we do not
    believe that samples cause significant public health risks," said michael petrina,
    a vice president of the 260-member cosmetic, toiletry and fragrance association.
    "some small segment of the population will react adversely to every chemical that
    exists," he said, "if the law required everything that might cause such a reaction
    to be sealed, everything would have to be sealed." a vice president of webcraft
    technologies inc. of north brunswick, n.j. ("one of the world''s leading producers
    of fragrance and cosmetic sample strips"), said it was up to readers whether the
    aroma-bearing micro-capsules were released. typically, this is done by lifting
    a paper flap that covers the strip. the webcraft executive, george lane, said,
    "only through active and purposeful involvement will the fragrance sample release
    the true fragrance rendition." -'

    i am an unwed mother, so i know what i''m talking about. i am tired of seeing
    the boy get the dirty end of the deal when a girl gets pregnant. girls jump into
    bed on the first date and the boy thinks she must be protected or she wouldn''t
    be so willing. the next thing you know, he is paying a large amount of child support,
    which makes it very hard for him to consider marrying and having a family because
    he will be in debt for at least 18 years. i think birth control is much more the
    girl''s responsibility than the boy''s. the boy should use what is available to
    him, but it is a well-known fact that it also takes away from the pleasure, so
    most people don''t use anything. if the girls are going to risk getting pregnant,
    then they should be willing to pay their fair share financially. i mean like 50
    percent of the child support. if people think, "oh, the poor girl is stuck at
    home raising the baby so she shouldn''t have to pay," they are wrong. it is a
    privilege to raise a child-not a punishment. why should the boy pay all the support
    while the girl gets all the pleasure of being there for the baby and the boy has
    to beg for visitation rights? meanwhile, he has no say in how his child is being
    raised, but he has to support the baby and the mother. i raised my baby without
    any help from his father, and my only regret is that the father missed out on

    i have the perfect solution for all those people out there who are always complaining
    about not receiving thank-you notes. simply do not give a gift out of obligation-try
    giving it out of love. then notice that the person you give this gift to will
    give you a very sincere "thank you" (unless the person has no manners, in which
    case he or she didn''t deserve the gift in the first place). i do not mean to
    be ugly, but do you buy a gift only to get a thank-you note? i give gifts because
    i care about the person i am giving it to. if giving because you care isn''t the
    reason you give, then go out and buy something for the person you love the most-yourself.

    before you give me your list, i''d like to give you my list so you will know what
    i want and don''t want for christmas." sandra looked shocked. then she said, "gram,
    you know i don''t have any extra money to spend on gifts for you, but if that''s
    the way you''re going to be, you can just forget that you ever had a granddaughter!"
    and with that, she exited in a huff, slamming the door behind her! my friend looked
    at me, smiling, and said: "well, how did i do? i''m sorry you had to witness that,
    but i''m fed up with these grasping kids. i just had to put her in her place."

    "outraged in reno" wrote that her sister-in-law had a spoiled 2-year-old daughter
    who threw temper tantrums in order to get her own way, so she consulted a pediatrician.
    he advised her to splash cold water on the child''s face to bring her out of it.
    you recommended getting another pediatrician. why? that was excellent advice.
    in the 1930s, three of us girl cousins, who were as close as sisters, had baby
    boys within a few months of each other. we were also neighbors and the boys were
    raised like brothers. one day, my 2 1/2-year-old son had a temper tantrum and
    proceeded to beat his head against the floor until his nose bled! i panicked and
    consulted our family doctor. he told me that the next time the child had a tantrum,
    i should pick him up, put him face down in the sink and turn cold water on his
    head-just enough to shut him up. i followed his advice, and it worked! my cousins
    followed that advice, and it worked for them, too. today, one son is a successful
    cattle dealer, another is a physician and my son is a nuclear research engineer.

    i disagree with your advice to change pediatricians. what better way is there
    to get a child''s attention without raising your voice or using corporal punishment?
    splashing cold water in a child''s face is not cruel or violent. if more frustrated
    parents used this method of calming a child down, it could reduce child abuse.

    your advice to the overweight woman who asked what to do about a father-in-law
    who refused to stop making snide remarks about her weight went a long way toward
    reinforcing the notion that women are substandard to men. you suggested that she
    take it up with her husband, and expressed the hope that he is "man enough" to
    speak with his father in her defense. does this mean that if he refuses to do
    so, he is more akin to some weak woman? what would margaret thatcher say about
    this? or the late, great mother jones? a nationally syndicated columnist has tremendous
    power, abby. i would hope that you would encourage enlightened thinking rather
    than reinforce negative, false stereotypes. perhaps you meant to say that you
    hoped the woman''s husband was strong enough to speak to his father in her defense,
    a preferable approach. in considering this alternative, remember the words of

    drops in on you uninvited, you could say, "i''m sorry you didn''t call first-we''re

    a lot of housework to do tonight; we''ll talk to you tomorrow." or, "i''m sorry,

    will you please do a service for all adoptive families? inform newspaper editors

    a child; it was not until after they adopted a baby boy that mrs. brand became
    pregnant." there is no cause-and-effect here. the chances of conceiving a child
    are the same before and after adoption. implying that all one has to do is "relax"
    belittles the infertile couple''s experience, and is an insult to them and their
    adopted child. imagine how adoptees must feel when they read that they were just
    a means to an end-a reproductive aid to bring about their parents'' second child!
    adoptive parents do not think that way, but journalists thoughtlessly perpetuate
    the myth that adopted children are second-best. and another thing: could we all
    lighten up on phrases such as "adopt a whale," or "adopt a zoo animal"? one last

    1973. these new year''s resolutions are based on the original credo of alcoholics
    anonymous. i have taken the liberty of using that theme with some variations of
    my own: just for today i will live through this day only, and not set far-reaching
    goals to try to overcome all my problems at once. i know i can do something for
    24 hours that would appall me if i felt i had to keep it up for a lifetime. just
    for today i will be happy. abraham lincoln said, "most folks are about as happy
    as they make up their minds to be." he was right. i will not dwell on thoughts
    that depress me. i will chase them out of my mind and replace them with happy
    thoughts. just for today i will adjust myself to what is. i will face reality.
    i will correct those things that i can correct and accept those things i cannot
    correct. just for today i will improve my mind. i will not be a mental loafer.
    i will force myself to read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.
    just for today i will do something positive to improve my health. if i''m a smoker,
    i''ll make an honest effort to quit. if i''m overweight, i''ll eat nothing i know
    to be fattening. and i will force myself to exercise-even if it''s only walking
    around the block or using the stairs instead of the elevator. just for today i''ll
    do something i''ve been putting off for a long time. i''ll finally write that
    letter, make that phone call, clean that closet or straighten out those dresser
    drawers. just for today, before i speak i will ask myself, "is it true? is it
    kind?" and if the answer to either of those questions is negative, i won''t say
    it. just for today i will make a conscious effort to be agreeable. i will look
    as good as i can, dress becomingly, talk softly, act courteously and not interrupt
    when someone else is talking. just for today i''ll not improve anybody except
    myself. just for today i will have a program. i may not follow it exactly, but
    i will have it, thereby saving myself from two pests: hurry and indecision. just
    for today i will have a quiet half-hour to relax alone. during this time i will
    reflect on my behavior and get a better perspective on my life. just for today
    i will be unafraid. i will gather the courage to do what is right and take the
    responsibility for my own actions. i will expect nothing from the world, but i
    will realize that as i give to the world, the world will give to me. have a happy,
    healthy new year-and to ensure a happy new year for everyone else, if you''re
    driving, don''t drink, and if you''re drinking, don''t drive. -love, abby p.s.

    my family is torn apart. they resent my youngest son. "andy" is 35 years old and
    deaf, so i have to give him special help. he just moved back home with my husband
    and me after his second divorce. my husband is furious because andy doesn''t do
    anything to help me out, but he''s tired from working-so i do his chores. andy
    got drunk and totaled his car, so i bought him a new one and told him he doesn''t
    need to pay me back; i''d rather he saved his money. i take care of andy''s daughter
    when she visits so he can have some time with his friends. it''s only every other
    weekend, so why does my family get so upset? they say andy is irresponsible, and
    i am his problem! can you believe that? andy''s sister is hard-working and very
    responsible. she''s a success and doesn''t need me like her brother does. i don''t
    know why she''s mad at me for helping her handicapped brother. if she''d help
    more, i wouldn''t have to. please set them straight, abby. -distraught mom.'

    a friend of mine was picked up and arrested for raping a 24-year-old woman he
    had dated twice. he had sex with her the first time he took her out. he said she
    was easy. the second time he went out with her, she gave him the high-and-mighty
    act and refused to have sex with him. he got angry, and i guess you could say
    he overpowered her. now he''s got a rape charge against him, which i don''t think
    is fair. it seems to me that if she was willing to have sex with him on the first

    i am a petite, trim, attractive (i''ve been told), 60-year-old widow with a pleasing
    personality. i have been going with a successful, nice-looking widower for 18
    months. at the end of the first month, he asked me not to date anyone else, and
    i agreed not to if he promised me the same thing. he said, "fine." he painted
    glowing pictures of cruises he planned to take me on. i even went out and bought
    cruise clothes, but those trips never materialized. i finally pinned him down
    and asked him why he made such big promises but never delivered. he said, "frankly,
    there are so many lonely women out there who would not only pay their own way
    to go on a cruise with a man-they would pay his way, too!" (abby, this man brags
    that he has a net worth of $2 million!) now, after a year and a half of this affair,
    i have realized that he is never going to offer me anything more than his bed.
    he says he doesn''t want to marry me because he doesn''t want to be tied down,
    yet he expects sex daily in a lovely wifely fashion. i finally told him i want
    out because i wanted a man who would love and cherish me as i did him, so we could
    grow old together. he said that at least we had companionship-someone to eat and
    dance with. abby, this man wants a "good" woman by his side. yet he offers a good
    woman nothing in return. i have a name that is highly respected in this community.
    i have never had an affair in my life outside of this one. i truly fell in love
    with him. he professes to be a good christian. he has several pictures of jesus
    in his home, an open bible on a stand and "praying hands" on a stand. abby, do
    you think this man is using me? and what should i do? feeling used in texas.'

    i was a widow for many years. four years ago, i married a widower. his wife had
    a long bout with lung cancer and he never stops talking about it. it gets on my

    saddens me the way he dwells on it. another thing: every holiday, he goes to the

    me, i had to go out and buy my own poinsettia plant. at easter, there is always

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    surely you are as weary as i am of the media''s hyperventilated obsession with
    "the end of the ''80s"-and the silly, mass-produced notion that eras, epochs and
    ages come and go as neatly as sausages every 10 years. what they''re celebrating
    in eastern europe now, for example, is actually the end of the ''40s. the "roaring
    ''20s" actually began in 1917-i think with the advent of the turkey trot-and lasted
    in most countries until 1933, except in new orleans, where they never ended. the
    ''50s-perhaps better known as the donna reed epoch-actually ran from 1946 until
    1965, beginning with the advent of commercial television and ending, i think,
    on the day when women decided to stop wearing little white gloves even to the
    supermarket. it''s vividly brought home to me how little things really change
    over the years whenever i wander into a peculiar time capsule known as the wellfleet
    book store. situated across from the main wharf in timeless wellfleet, mass.,
    out on the far reaches of cape cod-and run by a salty old character who once worked
    in a chicago auto plant-this creaky emporium not only trades in vast heaps of
    early 20th century best sellers and well-thumbed detective novels, but has what
    must be the world''s greatest collection of old magazines. what goes around .
    . . among those i picked up there last summer was a june 1960 mccall''s. the cover
    copy lines advertised "what to see in new york this summer," "dining room decoration"
    and "such food pages!"-all of which could have been taken from the latest issue
    of truly trendy new york magazine. as amazing as it might seem to the present
    generation, there was sex in 1960, too. the truly timeless "dear abby" was in
    there, with something called "what is this thing called love?" and there was also
    an article entitled, "my love affair with the washing-machine man," though it
    had been torn out of this particular copy of mccall''s, apparently with great
    urgency. this old mccall''s was a little dated in one respect. the "daring new
    bikini swimsuits" it promoted on its cover proved to be about as daring as dear
    abby''s advice (i''m not even sure abby approves of navels). but, actually, you
    can see a lot of these quaint two-piece outfits at l.a.''s venice beach today.
    on boys. baubles, bangles i also picked up a march 1950 copy of a heavy-breathing
    pictorial magazine called night and day. it had lots of pix of ladies in fishnet
    stockings, bangles, beads, ruffles, bows, slit skirts and low-cut peasant blouses
    just like you see today-every time lacroix brings out a new collection. the fashion
    copy in night and day was rather like something out of the journal of medicine,
    however: "in fashion," it noted, "as in athletics, it''s the knee that makes the
    big difference. the dainty ankle, the pianissimo calf, and leave us not forget,
    the ducky femur are as nothing when stacked against the good old patella." my
    model friend dangerously strawberry-blond jan strimple has a ducky femur, but
    i''m not sure what she''d hit me with if i told her. girls'' choice i certainly
    couldn''t resist buying a copy of the september 1948 calling all girls. its advice
    on "what boys think about going dutch" seems quite appropriate in this age when
    women are flashing their own american express cards: "simply come right out and
    ask him if he wouldn''t like to take you to the dance-dutch treat. be sweet, simple-but
    direct about it. don''t make the boy squirm while you coyly approach the subject.
    "of course, (a girl) should introduce the subject in private-on a date would be
    perfect. otherwise, she should invite him over to her house to listen to records
    and drink coke and then ask him." nowadays, by that point, they''d probably be
    living together anyway. he''d move quickly out, though, if she started following
    the magazine''s advice on breast development: "if you''re really anxious about
    developing your chest, there are exercises that help. you can accomplish . . .
    results by lying on a long bench, feet hanging over the side and flat on the floor.
    move the arms in a complete arc as you would an overhand backstroke in the water.
    do this 15 times a day, and before long you''ll see a measurement change." especially
    in the patella. swearing ''em in considering the kind of language tiny tots are
    exposed to watching cable tv movies these days, i''m not sure how appropriate
    calling all girls'' advice on swearing is for the ''90s: "the temptation to break
    out with loud and long expletives is strong when you smear the nail polish on
    your index finger just as your date rings the doorbell. but if you give in to
    swearing in private, first thing you know you''ll become a source of embarrassment.
    . . . you may protest that you never say anything stronger than `goshalmighty,''
    but whoa, lass, aren''t you hedging? that and `darn'' and `heck'' and all such
    words are merely stand-ins for stronger phrases." no wonder i blush every time
    my friend countess betsy von furstenberg says "golly moses." my favorite purchase
    from the wellfleet book store was a march 1936 copy of a ladies'' magazine called
    delineator, which nowadays would be mistaken for an arnold schwarzenegger movie.
    smoked out delineator had a feminism of a morbid sort. one article noted: "most
    of us persist in thinking of women as the weaker sex. actually, they are much
    more durable than men. the frail little wife whose husband opens pullman windows
    and moves pianos for her will undoubtedly live to spend his insurance money."
    unless she belongs to the smart younger set. but in a true testament to timelessness,
    there was a short story in which a 1936 woman goes to a psychotherapist, not unlike
    the zillions practicing in l.a. today, who puts her in a trance and lets her see
    what life will be like in the 1980s when she''s old. she finds that there has
    been a world war, though it was in 1950 and lasted only 20 days, and that there
    is a united states of europe, which england refused to join. there are also helicopters,
    airliners, rocket cars, color photographs and a plague-like disease-similar to
    aids-that affects only women. but not to worry, there''s also a miracle product
    that extends life and prolongs youth. it''s called-no, not camels-but evitalin.
    unfortunately, there doesn''t seem to be any television commercial to advertise
    it on. on the whole, though, i think i''d rather be living in a time when you
    could say, "whoa lass, you''ve got a ducky femur." illustration photo caption:

    why do you perpetuate the idea that frequent sex is "normal"? you seem to believe

    for a cure or a divorce. millions of couples have infrequent sex-or none at all-and
    they are happy. for you to suggest that sex should be at the top of the list with
    air and water is a peculiar blind spot of yours. a streetwise punk uses this "sex-is-normal"
    argument to convince his virginal girlfriend to give in by implying that she is
    weird if she doesn''t. let people off the hook, abby. tell them that sexual frequency
    is a private arrangement that each couple must decide for themselves. who cares
    if it''s once a decade, or never again, if they''re content with their lives?
    wiser people stay married-sex or no sex. apparently that''s news to you, as you
    advised "practically untouched in tulsa" that if her husband didn''t see a doctor,
    she should see a lawyer. jan in boulder, colo.'

    which is considered "earthquake country," you could be visiting there-or japan,
    mexico, alaska or anywhere else where mother nature chooses to shake, rattle and

    few minutes-less time than most earthquakes last. what should you expect? during
    a major earthquake, you may experience a shaking that starts gently, and within
    a second or two grows violent and knocks you off your feet. or, you may be jarred
    first by a violent jolt-as though your dwelling were hit by a truck. a second
    or two later, you''ll feel the shaking, and find it very difficult (if not impossible)
    to move from one room to another. according to marvin o. davis of the federal
    emergency management agency in washington, d.c.: if you are indoors, stay there!
    get under a desk or a sturdy table, or stand in a doorway or a corner. the best
    places to be are under supported archways, against inside walls and under heavy
    pieces of furniture. stay away from windows (which could shatter), hanging objects
    such as chandeliers, suspended plants, mirrors or fireplaces whose chimneys might
    crumble, tall furniture such as china cabinets and bookcases that are not securely
    anchored to the walls. other possible hazards: water heaters that can pull away
    from pipes and rupture, appliances that could move enough to rupture gas or electrical
    lines, heavy picture frames or mirrors over the bed, and breakable (or heavy art)
    objects kept on high or open shelves that can become airborne. flammable liquids
    (such as painting or cleaning products) would be safer in a garage or outside
    shed. people who live in earthquake areas should know where the gas and water
    shutoff valves are. they should also have on hand adjustable wrenches, flashlights,
    portable radios, extra batteries, first aid kits and enough food and water to
    last at least three days. for a free pamphlet containing more detailed information

    on the subject of height: i seldom meet a short man who does not have the "small
    man syndrome." because he is short, he attempts to compensate for his shortness
    by being overbearing. i suspect that "single and short" is no exception. he betrays
    himself by saying, "i''d like to bop women up the side of the head to wake them
    up." the men i''ve loved have more class and character than to say that. yet i
    know one short man in his 70s with whom i''d run away tomorrow if he asked me.
    may i give some advice to short men? (1) examine your personality and don''t come
    on too strong to compensate for being short. (2) do not assume that tall women
    are not interested in you. ask them out. i have a final question for "single and
    short in minneapolis." he advises women to consider men who have less hair, are
    not trim and are under 6 feet tall. do you follow your own advice in reverse,
    and consider dating a woman who isn''t trim and pretty? tall in california ----------

    i''ve read your column for many years (i''m 55) and in many different newspapers
    as i have moved around a lot, but this is my first time to write. on march 16,
    1978, my son, johnny ray, who was 17 at the time, was working as a deckhand off
    the louisiana shore. the boat sank in stormy weather and no trace of johnny was
    ever found. the captain and engineer were rescued. the coast guard searched for
    days, but my son was never found. i can accept the fact that my son must have
    drowned, but his brothers and sisters cannot accept it. they want to believe that
    johnny is somewhere with amnesia, or that a boat rescued him while running drugs
    and took him to mexico. what i am trying to say, abby, is that when you don''t
    put someone to rest, it''s hard to accept that he or she is gone. i admit that
    even now when i see a lanky, blond, curly-haired young man walking-and from behind
    he looks like johnny-my heart skips a beat, but i know in my heart my son is gone.
    how does one deal with the grief? i suppose this letter is too long for your column,
    but i feel better for having written it. thanks for all the good you do. god bless.

    in a recent column, "wondering in oak park, ill." said, "i have tried to persuade
    my husband to get a vasectomy, but he was chicken." abby, why did you let her
    get away with that stupid statement without challenging her? unless there was
    more to her letter than you printed, we have heard only her side of the story.
    where is it written that a man must get a vasectomy because his wife wants him
    to? many letters in your column seem to indicate that since it''s easier for a
    man to get a vasectomy than it is for his wife to get a tubal ligation, he should
    have the operation. baloney! neither tubal ligations nor vasectomies are 100 percent
    reversible. what if the marriage is dissolved-or the spouse dies and the remaining
    mate wants to have children with another mate? calling one''s partner "chicken"
    because he doesn''t want to have a vasectomy is not an indication of a happy marriage.
    it reminds me of the old joke about lady astor and winston churchill. she is reputed
    to have said, "sir, if you were my husband, i would put poison in your tea." he
    replied, "and if you were my wife, i would drink it." pink pinkerton, pico rivera,

    thank you for your answer to "ashamed"-the hot-tempered mother of five who lost
    her temper and then regretted it. you said: "there is not a mother alive who has
    not done or said something in anger; words can cut as sharply as a knife." i am
    a pediatrician, and also a mother of three children. i appreciate your pointing
    out the universality of anger, and especially stating that words can hurt as much
    as physical abuse. whenever i hear a mother say to her child, "you are bad!",
    no matter how busy i am, i always take the time to explain, "your child trusts
    you and believes you-so never tell him that he is bad, or clumsy, or anything
    that will make him feel inferior. tell him that he is good, but he sometimes may
    do something bad." may i add a suggestion to your list of things a parent may
    do as an alternative to hitting a child? say a little prayer. if you believe as
    i do that every child is a child of god, you will know that god cares about you
    and will help you parent your child. he knows your stresses and can help you handle
    your feelings of anger so that they do not erupt in violent words or acts. kathryn

    i speak from 15 years'' experience supervising more than 100 graduate teaching
    assistants and counseling their students at colorado state university. at best,
    a romantic relationship with a student is a conflict of interest. the instructor
    may be inclined to assign a better grade in an effort to enhance the relationship.
    even if he''s fair, the other students will suspect favoritism. for the student,
    the conflict can be devastating. if she turns down a request for a date or refuses
    his advances, will it affect her grade? at worst, such a relationship can cross
    the fine line between poor judgment and sexual harassment. the solution is simple:
    instructors should not date students. if there is a mutual attraction, they should
    wait until the very end of the instructor-student relationship-when he is free
    to ask her for a date, and she is free to tell him to get lost. (four of my teaching
    assistants eventually married former students!) does the end of the semester seem
    too long to wait? too bad. that''s professionalism. psychologists shouldn''t date
    their patients, and instructors shouldn''t date their students, for similar reasons.
    so please, abby, tell all those lovesick instructors out there to cool it until
    juliet is in a less vulnerable position. j.g. wade jr., professor of chemistry,

    my boyfriend and i have been living together for nearly two years. randy is 25.

    because i wasn''t sure where our relationship was going. also, too many people
    kept asking me when we were getting married, and i couldn''t handle it. when randy
    gave me the ring, he said we would be getting married "in about a year," but i
    never could get him to set a date. abby, in order to plan a wedding, a bride needs
    at least three months'' notice, right? well, i never was able to get randy to

    do you blame me? i just discovered that the ring was missing. (i kept it hidden
    in the bathroom.) i asked randy if he had taken it, and he said yes-since i wasn''t
    wearing it, he just took it back. abby, i feel robbed-not so much in a material

    thank you for your answer to the wife of the man who "sulked" on and off for 25
    years. as you pointed out, the man could be suffering from a major depression
    of biochemical origin. perhaps my own experience could shed some light on this
    disorder: for years, i went through times of terrible, seemingly unexplainable
    depressions. i, too, was additionally burdened by the cheap-shot accusations that
    i was "sulking" or "feeling sorry for myself" for no apparent reason. such accusations
    succeeded only in antagonizing me and alienating me from those who thought they
    were helping-including some mental health counselors and non-physicians who couldn''t
    prescribe medications. what was so mysterious and unbearable about those episodes
    was that they seemed to happen for no reason. the truth is that 1 to 5 percent
    of the population suffers from inherited conditions in which major depressions-sometimes
    even resulting in suicide-occur, and these depressions may have no apparent cause.
    certain chemicals in the brain go out of whack, and the person falls into moods
    of despair and gloom. some people have these depressive mood swings exclusively.
    others (like myself) have them as part of manic-depressive illness in which our
    depressions switch over to periods of great energy, high spirits and enormous
    creativity. we are frequently called "geniuses" during these high times, but we
    are also accused of being "on something" (drugs) because no "normal" person switches
    moods so quickly, right? well, we''re not entirely normal. we can function normally
    by taking medications such as non-addicting lithium (not to be confused with the
    potentially addictive librium, please) and anti-depressants. and most of all,
    we can be helped by loved ones who realize-as you pointed out-that "sulking can
    be caused by a chemical imbalance." abby, i hope this isn''t too long for your
    column. tom in california'

    i am a cat lover, presently sharing my home with six cats. i live on a small farm,
    so most of the time the cats are outside. unfortunately, i married a man who dislikes
    cats, but he tolerates them for my sake-and he even started to show a little affection
    to one cat. well, that one cat sprayed him, and my husband was furious! i tried
    to explain that cats spray to mark their territory or to claim ownership, and
    it was the cat''s way of showing affection. my husband didn''t buy it. he insists
    it was a hostile gesture on the part of the cat, and now he will not let the cat
    in the house. the cat is heartbroken, and so am i. besides that, we went to the
    zoo in deland, fla., and when my husband walked up to the ocelot cage, one of
    the cats sprayed him! please ask your animal experts if a cat sprays someone to
    show affection, or is spraying a hostile gesture? in the cat house in florida.'

    no problems here today-just happiness and bursting with pride! in 1985, a young
    man wrote to you, wondering if he should go back to college. he said, "i am a
    36-year-old college dropout whose lifelong ambition was to be a physician, but
    it will take me seven years, and in seven years i will be 43 years old." your
    answer: "and how old will you be in seven years if you don''t go back to school?"
    abby, that made a tremendous impression on my son who was 29 years old at the
    time. danny had been toying with the idea of going back to college to study ornamental
    horticulture and landscape design, but he thought he was too old to be going to
    classes with students so much younger than himself. well, danny clipped that column
    and went back to college, and every time he became discouraged, he would read
    it again. as you can imagine, it is now yellow and worn, and finally had to be
    wrapped in plastic to hold it together. this morning danny anderson graduated
    from the university of tennessee-with honors! thank you, thank you, thank you!

  body: 'dear readers: can you believe tomorrow is st. valentine''s day again? it
    seems like only yesterday we took down the christmas decorations. well, young
    lovers-and older lovers, too-some years ago i wrote a column on how to keep your
    man happy. as soon as that hit print, i was asked, in the interest of fairness,
    to write another column on how to keep your woman happy. as a valentine to both
    men and women, here''s an updated version on how to keep each other happy: for
    women-be a sweetheart tell him daily that you love him. (if you''re married, don''t
    ask him if he loves you, or he''s liable to say, "i married you, didn''t i?")
    never criticize him in public. if you must criticize him, let it be constructive
    and in the spirit of love and helpfulness-never in anger as a putdown. don''t
    bad-mouth his friends-or worse yet, his relatives. keep him in mind when you''re
    reading. clip newspaper and magazine articles that might be helpful to him in
    his work. don''t invade his privacy. every man needs a desk, a closet or a cupboard
    to call his own. if it gets cluttered and somewhat messy, don''t try to tidy it
    up for him. (nobody''s perfect.) if he eats-or drinks-a little too much, don''t
    nag him about it. remind him gently that you wish he''d take better care of himself
    because you''d like to have him around to grow old and gray with. don''t sulk.
    if something''s bugging you, talk it out and clear the air. never give him the
    third degree about where he''s been (or with whom) when you weren''t with him.
    never lie to him. if there''s something you don''t want to tell him, reserve the
    right to remain silent. always keep yourself kissing-clean from head to toe. develop
    interests besides him. the more interests you have, the more interesting you''ll
    be. surprise him occasionally. a little love note taped to the bathroom mirror
    or hidden in his lunch pail or briefcase will warm his heart. for men-be a sweetheart
    tell her you love her. she can''t hear it too often. if you like the way she cooks,
    or the way she looks, dresses, smells-let her know it. you can''t compliment a
    woman too much. never try to make her jealous. and treat her with the same respect
    and courtesy you show women you don''t know well. in addition to remembering her
    on all the traditional gift-giving occasions-birthdays, anniversaries, christmas,
    hanukkah and valentine''s day-surprise her with a little gift for no reason at
    all. if you''ve had an especially wonderful evening, the morning after, send her
    flowers. if she works outside the home (and it''s a 50-50 bet that she does) send
    the flowers to her place of business. she''ll appreciate it twice as much. tight
    budget? bring home a single rose. be a little unpredictable. walk up behind her
    and plant a kiss on the back of her neck. remember, cleanliness is next to godliness,
    so when you feel turned on, turn on the shower and jump in. when you''re at a
    party together, never leave her alone while you''re off dancing (or being charming)
    with someone else. tell her she is the most wonderful person in the world, and
    she''ll believe that you are. if you want to be loved, be loving. be nice to her
    relatives, and they''ll tell her how lucky she is to have such a sweet guy.'

    is it too late to add my 2 cents'' worth about the controversy over lowering grades
    as punishment? i hope not, because i would like to air my feelings. when i was
    an 8th-grader, my brother was a senior at the then-largest high school in indianapolis.
    school was not easy for him, and his grades were not the best. however, in electrical
    shop he was tops. before honors day, he received notification to appear on stage
    for an award. but as seniors often do, he and several friends skipped a day of
    class near the end of the school term and went swimming at a nearby lake. my brother
    was suspended from school-not because he played hooky, but because he would not
    name the others with him for the officials. (the others were not suspended because
    they "cooperated.") as a result of his suspension, my brother was no longer eligible
    for the shop award, and it was given to another student. he had earned the award
    and he deserved it, but as part of his punishment, he did not receive it. as an
    8th-grader, i thought it was grossly unfair, and to this day i think the punishment
    was far greater than the "crime" called for. there''s more: on the other side
    of the coin, in my junior year, i was ill two different times during the first
    semester, causing me to miss two weeks of school on each occasion. because of
    these absences, i was unable to complete the required number of garments in my
    sewing class. school policy called for a grade of f. my teacher, however, knowing
    that the quality of my sewing was a, allowed me to stay after school one afternoon
    to complete my last garment so that i would not fail. well, i received the home
    economics award! it was special to me because i had determined four years earlier
    that if my brother couldn''t have the shop award, then i would have the home economics
    award. had my teacher not had a sense of fairness that went beyond the written
    rules, it would not have been possible. elementary teacher, newburgh, ind.'

    you had a letter in your column in the dallas morning news that i must comment

    their stepgrandmother? as a stepgrandmother, my advice is to let the grandchildren
    call you whatever they choose. when i remarried, we had five teen-agers between
    us. after his two sons married and had children, they called me by my first name-kay-because
    that is what their parents called me. when i read the letter in the column concerning
    what grandchildren should call a stepgrandparent, two thoughts came to mind proving
    that what they call her really doesn''t matter. first, my stepgrandson is the
    only left-handed person in that family. i am also left-handed; therefore, he tells
    people that he "takes after" kay. quite a compliment, because he''s not concerned
    with whether i am his biological grandmother or his grandmother by marriage. second,
    two years in a row, one of my little granddaughters has crawled across her "real"
    (biological) grandmother and grandfather (my husband) to hop up in my lap to rest
    and be cuddled in my arms. so good luck to that stepgrandmother who doesn''t know
    what her husband''s grandchildren should call her. may her children be as great
    a blessing to a second marriage as mine are to me. kay crenshaw, dallas'

    deep new understanding of human behavior and relieve them of their personality
    problems. on the other hand, what wonderful news to find that if short men behaved
    just right, they may earn the privilege of dating tall girls. i''m sure einstein
    and gandhi, not to mention picasso and freud, would be drooling at the prospect
    of dating girls taller than themselves. really, if shallowness has any relation

    i am a u.s. marine stationed in okinawa and enjoy your column in the stars and
    stripes. here''s my problem: i''m too big. i''m 6 feet 5 inches and weigh 260.
    i have never lifted weights or worked out, but i look like a jock. the truth is,
    i''m lazy as a dog. what''s my complaint? i don''t fit into small cars or airplane
    seats, and i have to have my clothes specially made. the average person assumes
    that i was a great football player. the truth is, i hated football but was forced
    to play. no matter where i go, some small guy wants to take me on because he has
    to prove something. if i fight him and lose, he''s a hero and i''m a wimp. if
    i win, i''m a bully-even if he started it. i''m sick of being told i resemble
    "the hulk," "frankenstein," "herman munster" or some other big lout. i could go
    on and on about how most people think all big guys are clumsy, insensitive and
    dumb-which they are not. i''m big, but i''m human, i get thirsty, hungry and tired
    just like a smaller guy. i can''t bench-press a bus, but i have feelings. i bleed
    when i''m cut, i love music, poetry, puppies and children. when i was 12 years
    old, the kids gave me a nickname that has stuck with me ever since. sign this:

    i have a complaint that has bothered me for years. it''s size discrimination.
    i am a tall, big woman. all my life i''ve suffered humiliation because of my size.
    when i''d go out with kids my age on halloween, adults would say, "aren''t you
    a little too old to be out trick-or-treating?" (i''d go home in tears.) and when
    i was 10 years old, the cashier at the movie theater accused me of being more
    than 12 and trying to get in with a child''s ticket. the discrimination didn''t
    stop when i became an adult. in my office job, i''m expected to lift heavy things,
    help move furniture, get supplies down from the top shelves and do chores only
    a man would be asked to do because i''m 5 feet 11 inches, broad-shouldered and
    husky. because i''m big, people assume i''m strong as a horse and never get tired.
    meanwhile, the petite women are constantly being helped and treated with courtesy
    and consideration. abby, please print this so others will realize that big women
    need as much consideration as a smaller women. in fact, because big women have
    been discriminated against all their lives, they are even more sensitive and in
    need of kindness than their smaller sisters. big and battered in tulsa'

    my mother passed away seven months ago after a long illness. she was 74. she and
    dad were inseparable, and the first few months he was terribly depressed and didn''t
    want to go on living, but he finally snapped out of it. dad is 75. well, "marge,"
    who had been one of mom''s closest friends (a widow for four years), did a lot
    to bring dad out of his depression, and they started seeing each other. these
    past few months dad and marge have been together every day-and who knows about
    the nights? dad has a lovely bungalow and marge owns a very nice condo. now dad
    is talking about either selling his bungalow, or marge selling her condo, and
    moving in together. we are happy that they are keeping company, but we don''t
    think it''s a very good idea for them to live together. how can we prevent this
    from happening without being "meddling" children? dad''s daughters.'

    to serve in all military positions-except on submarines-in the canadian armed

    missed the most were showers and bathrooms. (winston churchill called yalta "the
    worst choice in the world-good for typhus and lice which thrive in those parts."
    he was right.) president roosevelt was assigned the only private bathroom at yalta.
    all the others had to go down to one of the minesweepers docked at the port in
    order to take a shower. no comments were made regarding body odor, as that would
    have been most impolite and inappropriate in the diplomatic process. however,

    my family and i have recently undergone nine weeks of home hospice care for my
    terminally ill mother. words cannot describe the marvelous care she received from
    this wonderful kind of service, as well as the emotional support and direction
    we, her caregivers, received. my sister and i, and my mother''s sister, were the
    primary caregivers and, as such, we learned a great deal about home hospice care
    behavior for visitors and relatives alike. you would do your readers a big favor
    if you print the following information for the benefit of patients under home
    hospice care: 1. remember, the patient is terminally ill and will not recover,
    so do not say, "i hope you get well soon," or, "are you feeling better today?"
    say instead, "i am so glad that you are able to visit with us for a while." 2.
    do not overstay your visit. five or 10 minutes is all that most weakened patients
    can tolerate. 3. do not expect coffee, refreshments or entertainment. remember
    that the caregivers are already exhausted from giving 24-hour-a-day care. 4. do
    not bring unsolicited food or plants. the patient may feel guilty for not joyfully
    responding to either. instead, send appropriate greeting cards and short notes,
    which can be leisurely read to the patient. 5. if possible, use a restroom before
    coming to visit. the patient''s bathroom is usually loaded with wet laundry and/or
    necessary medical supplies, and may be an embarrassment to the household. 6. do
    not telephone for daily reports-there is no secretary available for phone answering
    service. once or twice a week is sufficient. home hospice care is a wonderful
    arrangement for those patients (and families) who fit the criteria and who wish
    for death to occur at home. but, it is still a "hospital situation," and visitors
    should respect the wishes of the patient and caregivers. thanks for lending an
    ear. eugenia b. murray, r.n. staten island, n.y.'

    i''ve learned a great deal from reading your column. it also stirs up a lot of
    memories. recently when you said, "you never forget the hurts you suffered in
    school," it struck a chord with me. i went to a small high school. there were
    32 kids in my class-13 girls and 19 boys. all the girls took home economics. ten
    girls were selected to serve the seniors at the banquet before the prom. it was
    considered an honor. i never could understand why they didn''t ask all 13 girls
    to serve. why only 10? i was a good student, active in chorus and band, but i
    was rather shy. i weighed 90 pounds and was a 5-foot-2 string bean. i was heartbroken
    when i wasn''t chosen to serve. the home economics teacher had us three who were
    excluded sit at a table in the corner while the other 10 "practiced"-learning
    the correct way to serve. i will never forget sitting there, staring down at my
    plate, trying to hold back the tears. after class, i ran to the bathroom and cried.

    you recently reminded your readers about international forgiveness week, which
    is a wonderful idea. however, it is nothing new. in the jewish religion, there
    has been a "forgiveness fortnight" for at least 2,000 years. during the 10 days
    between rosh hashanah and yom kippur, those of the jewish faith are commanded
    to ask forgiveness from those whom they may have offended or wronged during the
    year. in judaism, god cannot forgive the sins a person has committed against another
    unless the sinner has asked that person for forgiveness. if the injured party
    rejects the apology three times, the wrongdoer is then released from his or her
    obligation to ask forgiveness. isn''t this a beautiful tradition, as well as a
    good way to begin a new year? esther krisman, los angeles'

    thank you for helping to educate the public about dog guides. these specially

    challenged. hearing and service dogs can be recognized by their orange collars
    and leashes, as well as id cards carried by their owners. all of these dog guides
    are guaranteed equal access with their owners to all public places. last year,

    willie had been rescued from an animal shelter and trained by paws with a cause

    service clubs (telephone pioneers, rotary, kiwanis and many others). therefore,
    there is no cost to the recipients. willie pulls rodger''s wheelchair, retrieves

    had been in their home many times. (once she had insisted that we stay two weeks

    picture included the mother, father and the children they had raised. at first

    his wife were wonderful, showing us the sights, taking us out for great meals,
    etc. our younger son took two days off work to be with us, brought the grandchildren
    out, and even took us to see his lovely new home one day when his wife was gone.
    (she''s intelligent, college-educated and has good manners.) when we got home,
    i wrote her a letter, apologizing for excluding her from the family pictures and
    telling her how proud i had always been of her, and hoped we could put this misunderstanding
    behind us. well, my letter was returned marked "refused." abby, what could i have

    think that after dropping me like a hot potato, he could just walk back into my

    i am 33 years old and have been reading your column for as long as i can remember.
    the letter from "grossed-out grandma" prompts my first letter to you. grandma
    was amazed and upset that her 3-year-old granddaughter was still breast-fed. abby,
    you are sure to get a lot of mail on this subject, so please pick the best ones
    and educate the public. breast milk is what nature intended for babies to drink.
    women have breasts primarily to nourish their offspring. there is nothing gross
    about it. what i find distressing is the number of mothers who breast-feed for
    only a few weeks, or months - or not at all. instead, they feed their babies man-made
    formulas that rank a distant second in their capacity to nourish. not to mention
    the expense of formula and bottles, and the time it takes to sterilize them. the
    convenience of breast milk can''t be beat. it''s always the right temperature,
    always available, no bottles to sterilize, and there''s nothing to pack or carry
    on outings. i fail to understand why anyone can be "grossed out" at something
    that is so natural. also, this notion that a child can become "too attached" to
    its mother baffles me. what else should a baby be attached to? by the way, i have
    two children. the oldest is now 4, and nursed until he was 3 years old. the youngest
    is 2, and still nurses two or three times a day. incidentally, i am a registered
    nurse, working part time. thanks for listening. i feel as though i am talking

    since when is it not okay to punish a child by paddling, if all else fails to

    create a sense of fear. i was paddled only twice in elementary school (it was
    legal in michigan). i remember it well, and i never felt abused. my self-esteem
    was not lowered and it made me remember that what i did was wrong, and i never
    did it again. you are right, abby, when you say that teachers and principals should
    not be expected to do the work of parents, but we both know that many parents
    do not discipline their children. it''s a fact that most children spend more time
    with their teachers than they do with their parents. most parents know what their
    children are like, yet they feel that they are the teachers'' responsibility as
    soon as they walk out the front door of their home. if a teacher were to give
    a disobedient child a paddling, that teacher would be slapped with a lawsuit from
    parents screaming "child abuser!" how sad our society has come to consider paddling
    a form of child abuse. since capital punishment has been abolished in many states,
    our crime rate has soared to an all-time high. why should the young cons care?
    they know they will either get probation or be sentenced to a couple of years,
    depending on the crime, and they''ll probably be released in just a few years,
    because our prisons are so overcrowded that they can''t keep them all. perhaps

    a crime, knowing that they would be punished. s.k.s., detroit'

    daughter surprised me. i came from a large farm family. my mother did a lot of

    i am utterly disgusted with people who whine because they were born in the month
    of december when people sometimes combine their birthday gift with their christmas
    gift. i have my own theory about birthday gifts: i think everyone should send
    his mother a gift on his own birthday. after all, who but his mother gave him
    the most precious gift of all - life? and as far as christmas gifts are concerned,
    that has turned into a gigantic commercial circus. if christians want to celebrate

    people come to you with every conceivable problem, so i''m encouraged to present

    get people to wash their hands after using the bathroom? in our home, the bathroom
    is right off the kitchen, and when the water is turned on, it can be heard in
    the next room. guests have gone into our bathroom, used the toilet (i can hear
    it being flushed) and then come out without having turned on the faucet, so i
    know they haven''t washed their hands. then after supper, they offer to help me
    dry the dishes! (i always say no thank you.) there''s no telling what kind of
    infection could be transferred to my dishes from those unwashed hands. worse yet,
    where i work there''s a cafeteria, and i''ve seen some cafeteria employees walk
    out of a bathroom stall and go straight out to serve the people without having
    washed their hands. some of them even wipe and polish dishes as they come out
    of the dishwasher. can you imagine the disease risks a diner faces when he uses

    on feb. 9, 1987, my wife went to the hospital for a biopsy of a lump on her right
    breast. well, it was cancer in an advanced stage, and had already spread to her
    lymph nodes. the biopsy turned into a radical mastectomy, but the nightmare was
    not over yet. she endured three years of chemotherapy, and i watched her suffer
    from all the side effects, until it slowly wore her down. she died on dec. 27,
    1989. abby, this all happened because she was too embarrassed to expose her breasts

    the next morning we took them out for breakfast and told them we were working

    assumed it was low-cal because she knows i am on a weight-management program and

    about the ingredients and she said, "oh, it''s very fattening." i was shocked.
    i''m not knocking her manners, just her choice of a gift. besides, i live alone,
    and she knows what a struggle i have resisting temptation. she insisted that i
    cut the cake right away, and we each had a piece. (it was delicious.) then i cut
    the remaining cake into small pieces to freeze, with the idea that when i wanted
    a "treat," it would be there. well, the minute she left, i was into the cake,
    and i ended up throwing most of it away, as i found myself slipping back into
    my old habits and eating one piece after the other. i probably should have thanked
    her as soon as i saw the cake and insisted that she take it home with her, but

    when my husband and i were married, i chose to retain my own last name. when our

    why does everyone ignore the sexual aspect of women in combat? one thing that

    the largest peacetime operation undertaken by the government is upon us-the 21st
    decennial census. the census bureau has hired 480,000 people, rented almost 5
    million square feet of office space, is using 68,000 cardboard desks and will
    sharpen more than 9 million pencils. the mission, pure and simple, is to count
    every person residing in the united states. we expect to count about 250 million
    people and 106 million households. why? why does the federal government go to
    all the trouble to count everyone? because the task was mandated by congress in
    1790 for the purpose of apportionment-representation in the u.s. house of representatives.
    today, it is used for that and for distributing billions of federal dollars a
    year to local projects and agencies. nutrition programs, day care centers and
    transportation systems are a few. many times individuals don''t realize programs
    and services they use are funded by the federal government based on census results.
    it is to everyone''s benefit to answer the census. an individual''s answers on
    the questionnaire are completely confidential. the information will not be given
    to the irs, ins (immigration and naturalization service), fbi or anyone else.
    only aggregate, or compiled, figures will be available for public use. so, abby,

    i''ve been thinking about that letter from "big and battered"-the extra-large
    woman who recited the trials and tribulations of being big. she said, "petite
    women are given more courtesy and consideration." well, that ain''t necessarily
    so. i happen to be 4 feet 10 inches, 21 years old and petite. and i''ve had my
    share of insults. i''ve been accused (at my age) of trying to get into r-rated
    movies while being underage. when i go to a bar, i have to bring two ids to convince
    them that i''m actually 21. also, taller people pat me on the head, and i don''t
    know whether to bark like a dog or cry like a baby. some people assume i''m empty-headed
    because i look like a kewpie doll. and when some nice person patronizes me with
    "good things come in small packages," there''s always some wise guy who adds:
    "so does poison." i hear there''s a club for little people. will you please print

    keeping women out of combat duty has nothing to do with their ability to perform
    in battle. the real reason, simply put: women are able to reproduce; men are not.
    as you know, in any war, the worst contingency is to have your army wiped out.
    if that occurs, the only chance for survival is to repopulate. abby, it is a fact
    that women can reproduce only once every nine months, but men can father children
    virtually every day. thus, in order to protect our ability to repopulate, we need
    women in far greater number than men. remember that old "sinking ship" motto:
    "women and children first"? it was a wise one. not as a matter of chivalry, but
    in order to preserve the species. david barrere, englewood, colo.'

    you printed a letter from "tony''s wife," the waiter''s spouse who complained
    about a party who came in near closing time and sat around for a very long time-giving
    no consideration whatsoever to the waiter. (this was a five-star restaurant.)
    i am a business executive now, but i worked as a waiter for a long time, so i
    feel qualified to comment. no one walks into a five-star restaurant for a "quick
    bite"; at those prices, the customers usually linger for a long time. tony''s
    wife said the check was presented long before the party was ready to leave-hoping
    they would take the hint. abby, this is unacceptable in a fine restaurant. tony''s
    wife also complained about the 12 percent tip, saying it should have been 20 percent.
    how can she make that judgment? that''s the customer''s decision. besides, 12
    percent is not a bad tip; i always considered 10 to 15 percent from a new customer
    to be normal. when i dine in a fine restaurant, i don''t concern myself with how
    long the waiter has been there, or the fact that he may have an early-morning
    class. i just want good service, and i tip accordingly. as a waiter, i welcomed
    the late stragglers, even though i had to get up early for my day job. i would
    then pamper those diners as much as they would let me, which was easy to do after
    the crowd was gone. i wanted those customers to come back and ask for me to serve
    their table. that''s how a good waiter earns big tips. if tony''s attitude is
    the same as his wife''s, he''s probably in the wrong job. been on both sides of

    with birthday cards and letters from all over the world. "the american portion
    of these letters were especially overwhelming, thanks to the letter from david
    c. graham of san diego, which dear abby published in her nationally syndicated
    newspaper column. "i conferred with president gorbachev''s assistant concerning
    this matter, and he confirmed that birthday greetings had arrived by the thousands

    my sweet, little, naive neighbor lady, at least 70 years old, is being romanced
    by a 49-year-old attractive man whom she hired to help with taxes and financial
    matters. her husband died last year, leaving an estate of close to a million dollars,
    which, of course, this man is aware of. she has no family. she tells me that he
    has proposed marriage and she has said yes. no date has been set as yet, but she
    is on cloud nine and flitting around like a teen-ager. she says he just wants
    a companion and, due to a physical "problem," he cannot be a husband to a younger
    woman. (i presume he''s impotent.) i called the police to see if there was some
    way they could quietly check up on this man. they said there was nothing they
    could do. and since he has no criminal record, they cannot make a formal investigation.
    abby, i think i smell a rat. is there anything i can do to protect this woman
    from being taken advantage of? worried neighbor'

    i just returned from the beauty salon more than just a little disgusted. the entire

    withholding partial payment, as i felt that i had about 50 percent of her attention.
    this is not the first time she has carried on a telephone converation while setting

    years ago, during world war ii, my husband, "lou," had a brief affair with a woman
    whose husband was killed in action. (this was before lou and i met.) this woman
    named lou the father of her child and he paid child support until the child was
    18 years old. lou and i recently had our wills drawn up, and he explained all
    of this to his lawyer. the lawyer recommended that lou state in his will that
    he wishes to leave $1 to the child he acknowledged and supported. my question:
    was this necessary? why do we have to open the closet and let this skeleton out?
    i see no point in this-only harm-as the child (i am told) and our children do
    not know about this, and when they read it in the will, it will be a great shock
    to all of them. i would greatly appreciate it if you would clear this problem

    may we bend your ear with a pet peeve? it''s grocery stores that use automatic
    scanners and no longer put prices on their merchandise. they insist that this
    is for the customers'' "convenience." prices (not always current) are shown on
    the front of the grocery store shelves. how is an elderly person, a pregnant woman,
    someone with arthritis or bifocals, or in a wheelchair-or just overweight-supposed
    to read the prices under the bottom shelf? if there are no prices on the items
    in your grocery cart, how can you quickly tally the total before you get to the
    checkout and the clerk informs you that you owe more than you can pay? most stores
    offer to refund scanning errors. this does not make up for the aggravation and
    time wasted. a shopper''s only alternative is to patronize a store that still
    marks their merchandise the old-fashioned way. new is not always better-at least
    for customers-but complaints fall on deaf ears. gwen and sally mcbreairty, willow

    after reading your column stressing the importance of washing one''s hands after

    stating, "every employee must wash his hands before returning to work." a foreman
    was about to leave the washroom when he spotted a worker about to leave without
    washing his hands. he stopped him and yelled, "hey! can''t you read that sign?"
