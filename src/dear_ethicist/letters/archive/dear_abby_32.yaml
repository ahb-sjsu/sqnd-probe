    i''m in love with a woman named "camille" who has three children from three different

    her children calling "daddy" even though he''s not. i have loved camille for 20

    one child. camille says she loves me and wants us to be married, but i''m having

    i am a high school senior who has been filling out applications for college. i
    have found a few small liberal arts colleges i''d love to attend, and i have a
    favorite. my problem: my father has been out of work for quite some time. he has
    applied for a job at a large state college. i visited the school and don''t like
    it because it''s a huge party school. my mother has now informed me that if dad
    gets the job, i''ll have no choice but to go there because we would get a 70 percent
    discount in tuition. i feel angry and guilty at the same time. the anger is because
    my parents had promised me that college would be my choice. the guilt is for not
    wanting my father to get this job, even though it would greatly help my family''s
    financial situation. dad has made the second round of the long interview process.

    my wife has been out of work for four months. last week she applied for a job
    at a loan office. during the interview, she learned it was a payday loan operation,
    and she would be expected to get people to sign up for loans they could not afford.
    this goes against our principles. we have seen family members caught in payday
    loan schemes that buried them in debt, and we find the whole industry to be immoral
    and abhorrent. my wife is currently receiving unemployment compensation. one of
    the rules of unemployment is, if a company offers you work, you must accept it.
    she said if she knew what the position entailed, she would not have applied. now
    she is terrified she may be offered a position in a business she finds repugnant,
    but she may not be able to decline the offer. what can she do? please answer fast!

    i''m the mother of two boys who are 12 and 13. the letter from "terrified for

    at school? i know kids are curious and experiment at this age, but it''s disturbing

    if no one answers the phone when my mother calls, she shouts on the answering

    his favorite team lost. he also has strong hatred toward rival teams. his arguments

    "problem" makes him unpleasant to be around. when i visit friends and family without

    i went through a difficult depression during the time i was pregnant with my daughter.
    as a result, i seriously considered placing her for adoption and kept the pregnancy
    hidden from friends and co-workers. during my third trimester i took a leave of
    absence and cut off contact with my friends completely. now, two years later,
    i''m happy to report that i received therapy and treatment for my depression and
    anxiety. i am living a happy life with my baby girl. the problem is, i told no
    one outside my family about my daughter or the situation, even though everyone
    noticed my abrupt change in behavior. how do i begin to share my story? will people
    be able to forgive me for cutting them out of my life during a difficult time?

    my mom died of an aneurysm 23 years ago. i was only 7. i occasionally hear an
    aunt or uncle talk about how much they loved her and miss her. i moved in with
    an aunt when i was 5, due to abuse from my father. two years later, my mom was
    gone. as kids, my brother and i never received counseling. we bounced from home
    to home and finally ended up in a stable environment with our grandma. i usually
    feel guilty when people talk about my mom because i cannot relate. i tell myself
    that maybe god sacrificed her so i could have a good life. sometimes, i feel more
    anger than love toward her because of the abuse and abandonment. what am i supposed
    to feel about her? can someone love a person they never knew? to be honest, i
    don''t know how to feel about my mother. -- emotionless in oklahoma city'

    my 9-year-old son''s friend "isaac" was over for a visit. he was captivated by
    our labrador retriever, "layla," who is very loving. isaac doesn''t have a dog,
    so he wanted to play with layla. at one point, i overheard him say to my son,
    "look, i''m riding your dog!" i immediately intervened, but i was too late. a
    day or so later, layla was unable to descend our stairway and was clearly in pain.
    she has been on pain medication for three weeks and is growing progressively worse.
    the next step is to get x-rays and/or an mri to see if she has a spinal injury,
    and then determine her treatment. it''s possible the damage is irreversible. my
    wife and i are extremely upset about this, but we''re afraid to tell our son or
    isaac and his parents for fear it will place undue guilt on a 9-year-old boy.
    on the flip side, i wouldn''t want him to do this to anyone else''s beloved pet.

    my wife and i recently attended the funeral of a friend''s father. during the

    on the way home, this sparked a conversation about the obligation of a person
    who receives a handkerchief. should it be returned after the event, or should
    it first be laundered? or is it considered a gift, not to be returned at all?
    later that evening at a movie, i noticed a woman hand someone her handkerchief
    saying, "it''s monogrammed. it was my mother''s." no mention was made of a request
    that it be returned. i''m sure most people wouldn''t mind letting go of a standard

    i was with my boyfriend for two years when he left me for another woman. she was
    a lunatic who was possessive and jealous, not to mention desperate. after a while,
    he realized what he had with me and wanted to come back. because i still loved
    him, i gave him another chance. abby, she hasn''t stopped calling him! she parks
    in his driveway overnight. she refuses to take no for an answer, although he stopped
    having anything to do with her. now for the kicker: for his birthday, she bought
    them both a trip to a caribbean island -- and he accepted! he said he was going
    only for the trip, but i''m here and he is there with her now. what should i do?

    i have no contact with my mother for many reasons. it was difficult to sever the
    relationship, but after my son was born -- for his safety and well-being -- i
    felt i had no choice. my mother has seen my son once, when he was 6 months old.
    she had just been released from jail and arrived at my home stoned and out of
    it. i made sure she found a safe way home and haven''t spoken to her since. my
    son will be 3 soon. yesterday we were talking about families and he asked, "you
    don''t have a mommy?" i replied, "yes, i do. her name is cindy." thankfully, he
    left it at that. but it started me thinking about what i should say when he asks
    me questions about his grandmother. i had planned on talking to him when he was
    older because addictions can run in families, and i want him to be aware of it

    to text messages and threats of divorce if i don''t tell him everything he wants

    or just tell him to go. he was wonderful when we first got together, but now he
    says marrying me was just a ruse to get sex. what can i do? i miss the person

    my 24-year-old daughter, "evy," is falling to the rocky bottom. she has taken
    advantage of everyone in our family. she thinks she''s the victim instead of realizing
    she is the problem. she''s planning to marry "dave," a man she has known for only
    six months. she refuses to consider his past criminal record of domestic abuse.
    abby, this man has several children, one of whom he does not acknowledge. am i
    wrong to be involved in this wedding? i feel it would be a mistake to be "supportive"
    when i''m totally against it. dave has pushed her already, and i know what lies

    my family was invited to my cousin "kirk''s" wedding -- a small affair for family
    and close friends only. my brother "ryan" and his wife, "dawn," decided to schedule
    their daughter''s first birthday party on the same day and not attend the wedding.
    the birthday party was at 4; the wedding at 6. the locations were an hour apart.
    we attended the birthday celebration and left early to get to the wedding on time,
    as did mom and dad. as a gift, we chipped in to get kirk and his bride, "kallie,"
    an upgrade on their cruise cabin. they loved it. ryan and dawn contributed as
    well. the bridal couple asked that, since ryan and dawn didn''t attend, i thank
    them -- although they planned to send written formal thank-yous after their honeymoon.
    i called ryan the next day to tell him kirk and kallie were appreciative, the
    wedding and reception were beautiful, and they were missed. six weeks have passed
    and my brother and sister-in-law refuse to speak to me. i learned they felt the
    phone call i placed after the wedding was "inappropriate." i was "throwing the
    wedding in their faces" and "had no right" to leave the birthday party. i apologized,
    but they still won''t talk to me, though they''re speaking to our parents. ryan

    my sister "mimi" died two years ago. throughout her 40-year marriage she and her
    husband lived away from family and barely kept in touch, although we were close
    while growing up. since her death, my husband and i have tried to keep in touch
    with her husband, "clint." the problem is, when i call him, all he talks about
    is the past, when we were all in school. that''s ok, but it invariably has some

    the conversation to mimi -- anything -- to no avail. now i''m wondering if my

    invisible, and he has attached himself to the one person who has befriended him,

    after nine years of marriage, my husband, "brett," and i welcomed our first child
    10 months ago. we are happy except for a problem with brett''s mother, "carol."
    carol and i have had a rocky relationship, although in recent years things seem
    to have gotten better. my complaint (and brett''s as well) with carol is that
    she is intrusive. she always wants to be in the middle of everything and won''t
    ease up on "mothering" brett. furthermore, carol has decided our child should
    call her "grandmommy" or "mommy smith." i object to that name because i feel "mommy"
    is the one name reserved for me. i don''t mind "grandma," "grandmother" or "granny."
    but carol won''t back down. we tried coming up with another name, but she has
    ignored our suggestions. am i being unreasonable? please advise. -- the only mommy

    so often i read about troubled marriages in your column. may i share with you
    something that my husband and i started doing that has transformed what i thought
    was a good marriage into a blissful one? one day, after complaining that we had
    no quality time together -- we rarely talked, much less made love -- my husband
    suggested we turn off the television and offered to give me a massage. ever since,
    four or five times a week, once the children are in bed, we go into our bedroom,
    take off our clothes and give each other long massages. sometimes we spend the
    entire time in conversation, other times we savor the peace and quiet. sometimes
    we make passionate love; other times we fall asleep naked in each other''s arms,
    completely content. it doesn''t matter how it turns out; it''s wonderful and it
    has made the rest of our lives less stressful and more enjoyable. our sex life
    is better than before the children came, and we sleep in the nude more often.
    i hope you''ll print this. more marriages would take a turn for the better if
    couples made time for each other and discovered the wonders of massage. -- happier

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i live in a dorm at a large university where a former friend, "glen," also lives.
    we are no longer on speaking terms because of an incident that happened last year.
    one day during pre-finals week, i left my room briefly to get something from a
    friend''s room down the hall. i left my door unlocked because i''d be back soon.
    when i returned a few minutes later, my laptop, my cell phone and several books
    full of class notes were missing. i was distraught almost to the point of a breakdown.
    later that night, glen knocked on my door and revealed that he had hidden the
    items in his room to "teach me a lesson" about not locking my door. i was speechless
    that a "friend" could do such a thing to me. i notified the police and officials
    at the university. glen was arrested for theft and charged with a misdemeanor.
    the university terminated his scholarship, and he was sentenced to community service.
    glen is now blaming me for what happened. he claims what he did wasn''t really
    "stealing" and that i ruined his life. he''s harassing me at every opportunity
    and spreading misinformation to my friends. i believe i acted justly to what was
    plainly a case of theft. am i wrong? how should i act in the case of glen''s current
    behavior? -- victim in texas'

    my husband and i have been arguing about his leaving the lights on throughout
    our house. he''s convinced that it adds little to our electric bill, but it bothers
    me that every single light is left burning. i realize there is a cost difference

    i am a fairly conservative young woman, and also somewhat shy. i have been dating
    a young man who comes from a much more casual culture than i do. this has its
    benefits -- he laughs often and deeply, and easily connects with people. but it
    also has its downside. "mac" has a terrible habit of talking publicly about what
    we do in the bedroom. he means it in a teasing way, and he''s never insulting.
    he can''t understand why it upsets me, although he is always remorseful when he
    realizes i''m angry. he worries that i''m ashamed of him and what we do, but i''m
    not. i just don''t want it to be a topic of public discussion, especially with
    people from my church. i find it embarrassing to have my love life made public.
    mac is never mean-spirited, only vulgar, which to him is acceptable. i love him.

    a former student asked me to write a character reference to help her land a teaching
    job abroad. i agreed, since i thought highly of her potential as a teacher and
    scholar, and her level of character. however, after she was placed in the classroom,
    the ministry of education of the nation where she was to teach discovered some
    inappropriate posting on her social networking site. because i had written the
    recommendation, they contacted me asking if they had a problem and provided me
    with copies of what they had found. her posting detailed a history of forging
    fake ids to buy alcohol while underage, numerous episodes of binge drinking in
    high school and college, her marijuana use and several exhibitionistic stunts
    and sexual activities that i won''t mention. i was shocked. none of this matched
    the person i thought i knew. when i tried to contact her to let her know she had
    been discovered, she rebuffed my inquiries and cut off all contact! her parents''
    response was denial and to "kill the messenger." i have been left with the problem
    of how to respond to the ministry''s questions. ordinarily i would not want my
    signature associated with someone with those behaviors and attitudes, but this
    young woman is in legal jeopardy abroad. i still don''t know if what she wrote

    "the one left behind in oregon" (nov. 16) was disowned by her parents and brother

    he is dying. you told her she didn''t have to because he did not ask for forgiveness.
    i disagree. if she doesn''t do it, she will be the one to suffer. as a recovery
    counselor, i work with people to help them forgive those who had hurt them --
    whether or not the offenders deserved to be forgiven. why? because resentment
    hurts the resenter far more than it hurts the offender. grudges are cancers in
    our souls. forgiveness isn''t a gift we give to others, but a gift we give ourselves.
    it is especially important for "left behind" to see her father now as a way to

    my lifelong friend from childhood wonders why i am avoiding her. now that i am
    in my 80s, the unfairness of a lie from our past is still plaguing me. seventy-five
    years ago, at a sunday school picnic, i saw "mary ann''s" mother take something
    from another woman''s purse. as she looked around, she caught my eye and an ugly
    expression came over her face. days later, mary ann told me people in our church
    were being told that i was a thief. not having the maturity to handle the enormous
    falsehood, and knowing it wasn''t true, i chose to ignore it. but it didn''t go
    away. it followed me all my life. some years later, another friend advised me
    to talk to our minister, who told me to pray about it. my prayer was that he would
    stand up in the pulpit and declare my innocence, but it never came about and i
    eventually left the church. i learned later that mary ann''s mother had a habit

    i recently married a wonderful man. our wedding day was going perfectly and i
    had all the family i loved around me -- including my divorced grandparents. my
    grandfather has remarried, but still had a lot of unfinished legal business with
    grandma that needed settling. grandpa thought my wedding reception would be a
    good place to do it and served her with court papers there. i was so upset that
    he would do this on my special day, i have stopped talking to him. he dropped
    by my mom''s one day and i ignored him. he told me if i wanted to "divorce" him
    as my grandfather i could, but that he wasn''t wrong and wouldn''t apologize for
    it. please tell me what you think. am i wrong for expecting him to apologize to
    me for what he did? -- new iowa bride'

    what do you think of a person who makes fun of others about various "shortcomings"
    (e.g., being computer illiterate) while she knows little about these subjects
    herself? i am weary of listening to her whining voice belittling others. she''s
    always talking about how "stupid" this person is, and how "dumb" that person is.
    the individual i''m describing is my mother. growing up, i didn''t know differently.

    after two years of dating, my girlfriend, "noelle," and i have become engaged.
    i asked for her father''s blessing, and after first telling me he wanted a few
    weeks to think about it, he said yes. he then complained because he thought i''d
    ask him "somewhere with less distractions." (we were at the house, alone. he was
    sitting on the couch and i was in a chair.) i think he was just looking for something
    to gripe about. after receiving his blessing, i proposed. her dad says he''s happy
    for us, but keeps acting like the wedding is years away. we have set a date for
    nine months from now, but he won''t even discuss the budget. he calls noelle and
    tells her who he wants her to invite, but seems surprised to find out it costs
    money. he''s breaking her heart. i am buying a condo, so i don''t have much money
    available, but i have offered to help as much as i can. it''s killing noelle to
    have her father act this way. he is complaining about being forced to take out
    a loan. is there anything i can do to get him to realize he''s ruining this for
    his daughter? -- stressed-out groom, redwood city, calif.'

    i have been dating "lance" for about two years now. we communicate well, have
    great chemistry and are very affectionate with each other. lance is kind, creative

    who wants big things in life. i have traveled extensively and am very involved
    in the world of academia. lance works in a bar three nights a week and plays video

    and capable of doing so much more. is there any way to motivate him without nagging?

    my daughter was repeatedly date-raped at the age of 16. her predator threatened
    to kill her if she ever told, so she kept it to herself until she could get away
    from him. it was a very scary time in her life, but with the help of counseling
    she is working through it and moving on with her life. the problem is, while visiting
    with my in-laws it was pointed out to us that my mother-in-law had made a collage
    of pictures and included in it the person who raped my daughter. in all, there
    are five pictures of him in group settings. when my husband asked her calmly to
    remove them, she refused. she says it would punish the other grandchildren if
    she removed the pictures, and it would "ruin her collage." we have asked her three
    times, but she refuses to budge. she says we all need counseling and that the

    i was shocked the other day when a friend of mine said that many women remain
    in terrible marriages because of finances. she said those types of marriages are
    accepted worldwide, so why not in america? she also said she thinks that shame
    is attached if a woman admits the only reason she is staying with her husband
    is a monetary one. the women she was talking about are baby boomers and older.
    after thinking about it, i remember my mother and mother-in-law saying that money

    may i comment on the letter from "itching to get even in cincinnati" (oct. 1),
    the woman who was upset that the handmade wreaths she had placed on her family
    graves had been stolen? i volunteer at a historical cemetery. many cemeteries
    have rules about the type and size of grave decorations that are allowed on the
    grounds, which is sometimes none at all. in fact, if decorations are allowed,
    unless they can be firmly attached to the ground, real flowers are usually preferred
    because they biodegrade and do not create a nightmare for groundskeepers when
    the plastic eventually weakens. while it''s touching that "itching" and her sister
    continue to make thoughtful and beautiful arrangements for their deceased loved
    ones, they should consider speaking with the cemetery office or groundskeeper
    about any regulations they might have in order to avoid this kind of upset again.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i confess, i can be a procrastinator. last year, my holiday cards sat on my desk,
    blank and unaddressed until almost easter, when it was far too late to send them.
    this year, i figured brevity was better than not getting them sent, so i had photo
    cards made and wrote short notes on each before mailing them. several of my relatives
    have now told me they felt "snubbed and offended" by my short notes. one aunt
    is particularly upset and said (via my mother) that my cards "clearly showed i
    don''t care about people, and i should have written proper letters or sent nothing."
    was i wrong to think "some" card was better than no card at all? also, how should
    i appease the aunt who is not speaking to me over this? -- holiday card writer,

    my 20-year-old son, "p.j.," dresses in army fatigues when he goes out. his clothes
    and boots -- including name patches -- make him look like a soldier. because he
    seems so fascinated with the outfit, i asked him if he wants to consider joining
    the military. he said he''s not interested, he just likes "the look." i''m embarrassed
    when we''re out together. friends have commented, "i didn''t know p.j. enlisted."
    my response is, "he''s not in the military. he just likes to dress the part."
    when strangers have approached him and thanked him for his service and for protecting
    our country, he actually says, "you''re welcome!" when i try to talk to him about
    it, he gets angry and tells me to mind my own business. i feel he''s representing

    i have been involved with a man in a long-distance relationship for two years.
    i care about him very much and i believe he cares for me. things were going great
    until he was devastated by a downturn in his business. he had planned to move
    here, but was unable to sell his home. we used to see each other every two weeks,
    but no longer. it has been almost two months. he calls once a week, but nothing
    else. we have been close and he has shared his life, his worries and personal
    information with me. i haven''t pressured him and i don''t need a commitment now,
    although i would like one someday. abby, he seems to be drifting away. is it ok
    to write to him, email him, send encouraging notes once a week and continue to
    support him? is it too much to ask for more frequent communication from him? i
    have offered to travel the 1,000 miles, but he has evaded my offer. i''m not ready
    to walk away. we have been great together and this is difficult for me. advice?

    would you please settle a disagreement i''m having with my mother''s boyfriend?
    the three of us go out to eat together often. most times we "go dutch" and pay
    for our own meals. the problem arises when he pays for my meal. he''ll request
    the senior price for all of us because he''s paying. i believe the senior discount
    should apply to the seniors in the group only, and mine should be the regular
    price. i don''t think it''s wrong to ask for the senior discount for theirs when
    i''m paying, but do not feel right claiming it for mine. (i''m more than 20 years
    away from qualifying.) it embarrasses me when he does it. i''d much rather pay
    the full adult price. even if it''s only 50 cents, i still feel like it''s cheating.
    shouldn''t a senior discount apply to items being purchased for the senior, or
    should the senior be able to apply their discount for everyone at the table, even

    my boyfriend "alex''s" mom is the most controlling person i have ever encountered.
    we only get to see each other on weekends because he lives an hour away from me.

    other two-thirds with her. i''m 22 and he is 21. he is also not allowed to stay
    with me. alex has to lie to her about where he''s staying in order to be able
    to spend time with me. his mom has added a feature to his cellphone in order to
    see where he is 24/7, and would cancel his service if he refused it. i love my

    my former roommate and i took a short trip to florida. we agreed we would split

    she paid me a month later, and i deposited her check as soon as i could get to
    my bank, which was three weeks later. when the check went through, she attacked
    me because she said it drained her account! i apologized, but told her i was upset
    that she was making it seem like it was my fault. i think that if someone is low
    on funds, the person should be more diligent in balancing his or her checkbook.

    my daughter thinks if people are busy they should not answer the phone. i believe
    it''s better to answer and tell the person you''re busy and that you will return
    their call. sometimes she doesn''t call me back for nine hours or even the next
    day. then i find out she was watching a movie or walking her dog, and didn''t
    think my call was "important" enough to respond promptly. as her mother, if i
    don''t hear back, i start to worry, even though she''s in her 20s and married
    with a family. when she calls me and i say i''m busy and will call her back, she
    gets mad and says i shouldn''t have answered at all. will you please tell us what

    my wife, "margie," recently lost her five-year battle with leukemia. i''m still
    grieving this huge loss. something i found particularly upsetting was the apathetic
    attitude of her doctor and his staff. margie was seeing a specialist in a city
    300 miles from our home. it involved many trips to his office as well as extended
    hospital treatments. during this period, we considered the doctor and his staff
    more than health care providers. we thought of them as our friends. margie would
    often bring them home-cooked meals or pastries from a bakery. in addition, because
    she did fine needlework, she made all the women a set of dishtowels. after my
    wife passed away at home, i sent a note to the doctor and his staff, thanking
    them and expressing gratitude for all they had done for her. i never received
    one message in return. i understand they treat many patients, but don''t you think
    someone could have given me a call or sent a sympathy card? i attend a bereavement

    in a few months, my husband''s 10-year-old twin grandchildren are coming to live
    with us while their mother serves her time for felony dui. my husband and i are
    in our 60s and have never met them before. we have tried to avoid contact with
    their mother because the encounters were generally unpleasant. she alternated
    between being bitter and hateful, and desperately calling for financial help because
    she''s a single mother with four children. she alienated her own mother and it
    looked like the younger children would wind up with child protective services
    if we didn''t step up and offer a temporary home with us. the new circumstances
    will require the four of us to make some big adjustments, but we believe it will

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    as veterans day approaches, may i share a few guidelines that can be helpful when
    interacting with veterans or service members? 1. it is never ok to ask a veteran
    if he or she has killed someone or to joke about it. if we have, we can''t even
    talk about it with our spouses, much less a stranger. 2. when you thank us for
    our service or pay for our meal, it is really appreciated. we also appreciate
    packages and notes. 3. please don''t tell us that wars are a waste of dollars
    or lives or were fought for oil. what we hear is that, in your opinion, our best
    friend died for nothing. we know many people disagree with war, but it''s better
    to keep your opinions to yourself. 4. many of us now have ptsd. if you see us
    acting anxious or moving away from crowds, turning our backs to the wall or fidgeting,
    simple kindness or a little distraction will be appreciated. talk to us about
    something interesting and give us some breathing room. 5. please remember that
    15 percent of those who serve in the military are women, and some have been in
    combat. it''s better to ask, "are you a veteran?" rather than, "was your husband
    a soldier?" 6. as with any person who has a disability, please do not stare at
    us. we can be sensitive about our scars or injuries and would prefer not to be
    asked to relive a difficult experience by being quizzed about what happened. please
    also understand that war injuries today are very different than in the past and
    are often not visible. it is not ok to tell someone they "don''t look disabled"
    or appear to need help. those of us with disabilities appreciate light conversation
    and assistance if we look like we are in need. it was my pleasure to serve our
    country. -- amanda c., u.s. army disabled veteran'

    we recently learned that our son-in-law, "mike," was fired from his job as a community

    on two women inmates he was supervising and is now in the process of going to
    court. we hope he''ll be convicted and sent away so our daughter can put her life
    together. this has torn our family apart. we don''t know how to get through to
    her that she deserves so much better than this. she refuses to divorce him even
    though this was happening during their marriage and her pregnancy, she claims
    she''s not being abused, but we have seen how controlling mike has been throughout
    their courtship and marriage. how can we help her realize that life without him
    would be so much better and that sex offenders are never really "cured"? they

    we have two family weddings coming up soon. one of our cousins has down syndrome,
    among other medical problems. he''s a grown man, but he has the mental capacity
    and manners of a 7-year-old. his parents don''t discipline him and he is out of
    control. he screams and talks loudly and will jump around on the dance floor and
    run into couples while they are trying to dance. his parents bring him to special
    occasions, even when it''s "adults only." the upcoming weddings will have receptions
    afterward and adult-only dances. don''t his parents have any common sense? this
    family has the attitude that if he isn''t invited, then they won''t go. i have
    reached the point that it is fine with me. how do we make it clear that he is
    not welcome? it would be a shame to pay thousands of dollars for a wedding and
    have it ruined by his behavior. most people probably won''t understand my point

    when my husband and i married, i thought i had hit the jackpot in mothers-in-law.
    we were becoming friends, going shopping together, etc. boy, was i wrong. now,
    five years later, i can''t stand her. just 15 minutes with her sends me over the
    edge. she''s rude, judgmental, and gossips like a teenager about everyone. she
    put together a cookbook for me filled with my husband''s favorite recipes. guess
    what? after trying half a dozen of them and failing at every one, i realized she
    had changed and added or omitted certain ingredients in every single one. when
    i asked about it, she told me she just wanted her son to prefer her cooking over
    mine. then there was the time she was baby-sitting and took our son to see santa
    claus for the very first time without asking or telling us. that''s an event parents
    want to be part of. i found out about it months later when i looked through her
    scrapbook. i''m not sure of her motives, but she has something against me. my
    husband is on my side 100 percent when it comes to his mother. he can''t stand

    the french foreign legion is a rational choice for this bored veteran of two tours

    several salespersons recently have ended our transaction by saying, "have a blessed
    day." the last two times it happened, i stopped and asked, "what do you mean by
    that?" both of them stammered and didn''t know what to say. one said, "i''m sort
    of religious." i replied that i''m atheist. i don''t think these folks realize
    what they''re saying. the next time it happens, i plan to respond by asking zeus
    to bestow blessings upon them as well. why do people feel they have a right to
    force their religious beliefs on customers? -- annoyed atheist in texas'

    i have known my boyfriend, "kyle," for eight years. we have been dating more than
    two years and living together for seven months. we have an amazing relationship.
    we love to laugh and make each other laugh. that''s a "quirk" we share. this morning,
    kyle woke up, went straight to his dad''s house without saying why and returned
    with his hair cut, beard trimmed and looking well-groomed. he seemed kind of "off,"
    though -- almost nervous. he then went to his mom''s to help with some yard work
    and when he came home, he snuck up behind me and slipped a ring on my finger.
    i got a little teary-eyed and asked where it came from. he said from his mom.
    he acted shy, wouldn''t say much or look right at me. then, after a moment, he
    shouted, "just kidding! i wanted to make you laugh and freak you out a little."
    i don''t think there was malicious intent on his part. he''s a sweetheart, but
    i don''t know how to tell him how badly he hurt me emotionally. i thought he was
    proposing. what should i do? -- unengaged in new hampshire'

    i am the single dad of two teenage boys (17 and 18) who are both in high school.
    i am wondering about something they do with their friends. the boys take showers
    in large groups. when they come in from running or sports, or if a group is spending
    the night, they shower in groups of two, three or four. it''s not like we have
    a huge shower -- it''s normal size. i know there''s nothing sexual going on because
    i can hear them talking and joking around. when i asked the boys about this, they
    looked at me like i had two heads. they said it was just a social thing and the
    same as showering together after football in the school gym. they also "air dry"
    after showers by walking around in towels, sometimes watching tv or goofing off
    for hours while in their towels. when going out, they get naked in the bathroom,
    fixing their hair, shaving, brushing their teeth, etc. it''s like a big "nude
    fest" with them and their friends. while i''m glad they are comfortable with their
    bodies and who they are, it still bothers me somewhat. am i being a prude in thinking

    touched when he offered to pay for most of the wedding expenses. last night, carolyn''s

    is deducting the expenses from carolyn''s inheritance from her grandmother. (the
    father is executor of her grandmother''s estate.) he has no idea that his wife
    told carolyn, and we''re sworn to secrecy because she will get into "deep, deep
    trouble" if he finds out she told. to make matters worse, he has the gall to make
    demands about the wedding as if he was paying for it himself. carolyn is so deeply
    hurt by this deception that she doesn''t even want her parents to attend the wedding.

    your column has been a fixture in my life. thank you for the smiles and the tears.
    my dilemma: i received yet another invitation to someone''s home for a "product
    party." in the past year, i have been considered a prospective buyer of cookware,
    candles, makeup, toys and vitamins. while i have at times used all these products,
    the invitations to sales parties that come from friends and sometimes friends
    of friends, irritate me. when i phone to decline, the hostess invariably says,
    "oh, you don''t have to buy anything." of course that''s not exactly entirely
    true because it''s a sales party, and "guests" are pressured in various ways to
    buy the product. people often buy things they don''t need or want because they
    fear they''d be disloyal to the hostess if they didn''t. when i was growing up,
    my father said, "you don''t invite friends to your house to sell them things."
    maybe dad was on to something. abby, how should unwanted invitations be handled?

    i am 13 and have a problem with my friend "will." he transferred to my school
    last year, and i seem to be his only friend. it has become a problem because i

    he''s hard to have around when i have parties, and he constantly interrupts me

    geek. he really can be sometimes, but he''s also a nice guy. my main problem is
    that at lunch he follows me around when i go to talk to my other friends. when
    i move to another part of the table, he moves, too -- right across from me --

    my husband, "aaron," had an affair with the woman next door. we were close friends.
    i found out three months ago, and needless to say i''m not happy about it. my
    husband and i spent a lot of time with her (he obviously more than i). aaron swears
    the affair is over, and he wants us to become a close threesome again. (she''s
    in the process of divorcing her husband, who knows nothing about the affair.)
    the three of us have gone to the beach, to the lake, dancing -- just like old
    times. my husband is thrilled; i am miserable. i am not convinced the affair is
    over, so i feel compelled to keep my eye on them. every time we go out together,
    i come home upset and frustrated. aaron says i''m being unreasonable and keeping
    him on a "short leash." he sees no reason why we can''t all be friends -- but
    i have no desire to be friends with her. aaron and i have been together more than
    20 years. i don''t want to divorce him. i need to know what to do without driving
    him back into her arms. i have suggested counseling. he says he doesn''t need
    it. what do you think i should do about this awkward situation? -- not loving

    my longtime friend "mona," a busy professional and social butterfly, had a baby
    last year. her son is now a toddler. aside from his regular day care, mona is
    lining up baby sitters so she can resume her social life. she has asked me to
    volunteer. i do not relate well to young children. i have had no experience with
    them and, quite frankly, want none. mona has always known this, but when i told
    her i didn''t think it would work out for me to baby-sit, she took offense and

    and he wants me to stop. (yeah, right! like i can turn my feelings on and off.)

    my father left my mother after 32 years of marriage. to say mom was devastated
    would be putting it mildly. she tried to keep things cordial for the sake of her
    four kids, but dad spurned her efforts. my three brothers and i are now married
    with children of our own. only recently have i been able to express how ashamed
    i am of myself and my siblings for the despicable way we have treated our mother
    for the past 17 years. dad was always arrogant, but he became even worse when
    he came into money. in our lives, dad became no. 1. the reason? you guessed it
    -- the money. we put our mother down every chance we got, and our spouses chimed
    right in. we visited her only once or twice a year and never repaid the money
    she lent us. she knew she wasn''t wanted or respected. dad is clueless to the
    fact that we hang around only because of what we can get (and have gotten) from
    him. this is still true of my brothers, but i no longer want any part of this
    charade. mom is gone now. no, she hasn''t passed away. she quietly moved out of
    our lives and i don''t know where she is. i don''t blame her for leaving. the
    abuse she took from us shouldn''t happen to a dog. when i look back, i remember
    a mother who held a full-time job, kept a marvelous home, was a great cook and
    had a wonderful laugh and sensitivity. she didn''t smoke, drink or cheat on dad.
    was she perfect? of course not; none of us is. all she wanted after the divorce
    was to be loved by her kids and spend time with her grandkids. now the grandkids
    are growing up without knowing this wonderful woman. mom, if you see this letter,
    i love you dearly. i hope you can someday forgive me for all the years of hateful
    remarks and unkind deeds. the pain you must have suffered is something i''ll have

    i''m really bad when it comes to speaking. it''s hard for me to squeak out the
    few words i can. i am shy and not very sociable, so when i''m with people, even
    my two friends, i feel like i come across as rude. i never have the right things
    to say. when i''m with my family, i don''t usually have this problem. in public,
    it seems like everyone else is so much more interesting than i am. making conversation
    is a lot of trouble. i know this sounds silly, but do you know if there is anything
    that can be done about it? i heard you had a booklet about being more social.
    is it still published? if so, how can i get one? -- victoria in south carolina'

    there for me when i needed her and vice versa. however, i can''t get past her
    continual bragging about herself every time we meet for lunch or talk on the phone.
    jamie always manages to bring up how some person told her how young she looks,
    or another told her she''s a wonderful manager at work, etc. yesterday at lunch
    i mentioned how much i love doing crossword puzzles. i said i love learning new
    words and if i don''t know the meaning, i look it up in my dictionary. jamie replied
    she doesn''t need a dictionary because she knows the meaning of all words! jamie
    is a good friend, but lately i''ve been wondering why she feels the need to spin
    tales. she is always out to impress everyone with how smart, young, savvy and

    my daughter "sally''s" husband, "donny," left her when she was three months pregnant
    with their second child. she had to move back in with us to make ends meet, and
    donny says it''s "too strange" to come here to visit his son. he hasn''t paid
    a nickel of child support since he left sally. he''s seeing another woman and
    wanted to introduce her to my grandson, but sally said he would have to pick him
    up at our house, so he refused. three days ago, donny emailed sally and asked
    her to call him when she goes into labor so he and his girlfriend can be there.
    she replied that he is welcome to come after the baby is born, but the girlfriend
    is not welcome. he emailed my daughter back that she is immature, and she needs
    to get used to the idea that the girlfriend is going to be involved in their children''s
    lives and she should "get over it." we are horrified that he thinks this is ok.

    male attention in a positive way. (i''m attractive and pass well.) the problem
    is, my attraction to women is fading and men are now much more appealing. my pulse
    races at the idea of spending time in the company of men, but no longer with women,
    who are now more like sisters than anything else. my relationship with my current
    female spouse has become that of a housemate or female family member. she was
    there for me during my changes, and now i feel i am evolving away from her. this
    upsets me, and i know it upsets her because we have talked about the possibility
    that this might occur. now i''m worried about breaking her heart, but feel if
    i don''t move on, i will have cheated myself out of living. what should i do?

    i know a fairly well-to-do couple who, after living together for a while, have
    decided to get married. i went to their online wedding registry to select something
    for them and was stunned to see that several of the items they had on there were
    pricey items for their cats. is this the status quo these days, or is it just
    plain bad taste? i chose to put money toward another item, but now i''m wondering
    if it will go where it was directed -- and not to the cats. it was also suggested
    that i provide an email address so that an e-card of thanks might be sent. abby,
    you keep telling your readers that times have changed. i reluctantly guess we
    need to resign ourselves to the emails, but what is your take on the gift suggestions?

    i had to chuckle at "where the boys aren''t." most guys would pay handsomely for
    the addresses of the clubs where women go to meet men. what is "where" doing that
    prevents her from meeting all the men she wants? my guess is she doesn''t walk
    up and introduce herself. she doesn''t grasp that dating rules get reversed at
    some point. she''s hoping to be swept off her feet like a schoolgirl. my advice
    to older women is to stop hanging out in escape literature and move over to the
    magazine rack. after a certain age, even sex won''t sell itself like it used to.
    drive your own car and, if you plan to stay after the introductions, buy your
    own drinks. arrive in pairs only with an agreement to split up if opportunity
    knocks. and remember, going to expensive bars will only net you a higher class
    of bum. "where" has repeatedly failed dating 101. there''s hardly a middle-aged
    guy in america who would turn down a woman who offered him a pizza, a cold beer
    and a quiet friday night at home. i''d even help with the dishes. but everything

    my grandfather recently went to jail for having child pornography on his laptop.
    the lawyers and everyone else say he molested me and my sister. i almost had to
    testify. i''m only 13 and have talked with people, but they don''t get it. i don''t
    want to talk to a therapist or anything, but my mom and aunt think i should. should
    i? i feel really sad right now. i first learned about this two years ago, but
    it still hurts. i kind of feel uncomfortable talking about it to people other
    than my best friends. i write sad poetry to express my feelings and it helps some.
    i don''t know what to do. it''s like i''m stuck in a rut. what should i be feeling?
    do i need to talk to someone? should i open up more? -- unsure of my feelings'

    i love my wife very much, but over the years we have drifted apart. at one time
    we considered separating, but we went to a marriage counselor and worked most
    things out. my wife is the only woman in the world for me, but my feelings are
    at the bottom of her priorities. i give her nightly foot massages and tell her
    how much she means to me. she never returns any pleasures. she has told me that
    sex is not enjoyable for her and she does it only to please me. i love her dearly,
    however the romance is gone. is it possible to rekindle the long-lost fire? --

    i am torn between two decisions. i am a 40-year-old teacher, but i have always
    wanted to be in law enforcement. i didn''t pursue my dream because my fiancee
    would not marry me if i went into police work. i have done well over the years,
    but my heart will not let go of being in law enforcement. my wife gives me the
    "you have a good job and you need to save for your kids" speech. i feel if i don''t
    at least try to pursue my dream it will always bug me. should i suck it up, do
    my time and be unfulfilled for the next 10 years? i feel like the old "you can
    be whatever you want to be" speech is an injustice to children if you as a parent
    can''t live up to this rule. what do you think about all this? -- living a lie

    my wife and i have thrown a barbecue for all our friends every summer since we
    were first married. over the last couple of years, our little party has morphed
    into a family-friendly event. our problem is one of our good friends is now the
    mother of an insufferable 3-year-old boy. "fenton''s" behavior has been awful
    for two years. at the last party, he managed to throw our ipod, slam our stereo
    to the ground, pick up and throw another child and terrorize a gentle dog. he
    barged in on a nursing mother and refused to leave when asked. we also suspect
    he was the one who tore our baby gate off its hinges. the mom is preoccupied with
    a new baby and deals with the situation by making idle threats. the dad makes
    jokes about how "it sucks to be a parent" and tells his kid to stop annoying him.
    we''re pretty sure if fenton returns for this year''s party, many of our other
    guests won''t. we want to remain friends with the mom, so not inviting her isn''t
    an option. would it be out of line to ask her to leave her husband and the little
    terror at home? -- smokin'' mad in pennsylvania'

    i''m a single woman who works two jobs and i am constantly on my feet. because
    of this i gravitate toward flat-soled shoes. i can''t imagine attempting all of
    the stairs i must climb each day while tottering on a high pair of heels or practically
    falling off platforms. i am friendly with two men (casually dating one of them)
    and each one has reacted negatively to my shoes. one of them said that i obviously
    don''t want to snag a guy because of my footwear, and the other repeated an old
    joke that, "a lesbian is a woman in comfortable shoes." i am a straight female
    who happens to feel more comfortable in flats. high heels might look nice, but
    they would cause me discomfort and problems during my long workdays. i have explained
    this to them, but they give me funny looks. do flat-soled shoes make you less
    of a woman or somehow suspect in terms of being "straight"? does our society view
    women in comfortable shoes as being possibly lesbian? i find the idea ridiculous,
    but two different men have come to the same conclusion. i''m confused about their
    attitudes and would appreciate your ideas. -- stepping out in missouri'

    "jane," the daughter of a life-long friend, attended my son''s wedding with her
    husband. my son and jane have known each other since childhood, and always flirted
    and acted as if they had a crush on each other. to make a long story short, after
    seeing each other during the weekend, my son left his wife of only one month and
    started a long-distance relationship with jane. jane continues to live with her
    husband. my son and jane have been open about their relationship with everyone
    in our families except her father and her husband. needless to say, those of us
    who know about this deceptive relationship are sick at heart and skeptical about
    who jane''s true love is -- her husband or my son. jane''s sister is being married
    soon. if jane is still keeping my son in a closet, i don''t want to see her at
    the upcoming wedding. there''s a chance jane''s husband may not be going because
    there''s evidence he might have an idea that his marriage is not healthy. should
    we attend the wedding to support my life-long friend, or stay away to avoid the
    pain of seeing the woman who has kept my son on a roller-coaster ride for years?
    -- to go or not to go?'
