    my husband, "james," and i have been married only three years. we are both in
    our 20s. everything is really great between us -- except our sex life. as far
    as he is concerned that''s fine, too, but i am not satisfied. it may seem odd
    to hear the female wants to have sex more frequently than a young and healthy
    male, but that''s the case in our relationship. abby, i work with the public and
    i get frequent remarks about what a beautiful woman i am. this makes it hard for
    me to believe that i don''t attract him at all. i have expressed many times that
    i wish we were more intimate. i have even expressed it to him in more than one
    letter, hoping to reach him. i am at a total loss as to how to make him realize
    how important this is to me. is there something wrong with my body? i just don''t
    know who to turn to for advice on this subject. please help me. -- short on intimacy

    you printed a letter from "feeling guilty, memphis, tenn." (9/6) from a woman
    wanting to call off her engagement to a soldier stationed in iraq. you stated,
    "under no circumstances should you ..." from my experience, i disagree. i am an
    operation iraqi freedom widow. i have maintained a steady friendship with my husband''s
    fellow soldiers and their mates. military personnel stationed in a war zone develop
    bonds stronger than blood ties. they eat, bathe, sleep, live and die together.
    i say, call him and tell him the truth. his comrades will know how to comfort
    him. when his tour is up, he will no longer have that 24/7 support. soldiers face
    enough problems readjusting to civilian life without dealing with a broken heart.
    if she waits and he dies, it will scar her for life. what if he has her listed
    as his beneficiary on his life insurance policy? if she doesn''t want him anymore,
    should she still receive $500,000? i have seen this happen with my own eyes. --

    my wife and i are in our early 30s, with a 2-year-old daughter and a baby on the
    way. both of our parents live eight to 10 hours away by car, so there is limited
    exposure to both sets of grandparents. the problem is my father. dad is very physically
    affectionate, even against the will of our daughter. for example, if she walks
    past him, he''ll grab her and squeeze her and kiss her while she struggles to
    break free. it''s all in the spirit of a playful hug, but it bothers my wife and
    me to hear and see our little daughter say "no!" and struggle to get away while
    he says things like, "no, i''m not going to let you get away. this is what a granddad
    does." my father imposes the same behavior on me, coming up behind me and forcibly
    hugging me while i cook, wash dishes or some other task. when i say this makes
    me uncomfortable, he either acts offended or makes fun of me. his aggressive demand
    for physical affection is becoming an issue with us. but when we say things like,
    "let her go" or "respect her boundaries," my parents make light of the situation.
    in fact, my mother said on her last visit, "your daughter has no boundaries!"
    what can we do to protect ourselves and our kids from my father''s aggression
    without hurting his feelings or starting a fight? -- anxious dad in ohio'

    i am a sophomore in college, currently living with two of my best friends in an

    i went to look at something else. later, my other roommate and i were waiting
    for beth to finish shopping. she came up to where we were sitting, and when i
    asked her if she was going to buy the t-shirt, she whispered that she was stealing
    it. i was in shock. i didn''t say anything because i wasn''t sure what was the

    last april, she began acting weird. she became very negative and seemed unhappy
    about everything. after attending a family vacation in june, gwen told me she
    wanted to "take a break." she said it was nothing i had done, but she needed time
    to figure things out because she didn''t know what she wanted. that was her only
    explanation. i have talked to gwen only a handful of times during the last few

    she mentioned that she had been hanging out with a friend who recently came back
    from iraq. she told me they have gone camping and done other things, like attend
    a concert. she also said they have kissed -- but nothing else. i know this isn''t

    your suggestion to borrow the book after the daughter reads it was a start, but
    i believe the mother should be more proactive. what about the novels attracts
    her daughter? because, believe me, the intimacy aspect is only a small part of
    it. perhaps the mother could explore the genre, find authors whose characters
    are more in line with her own views, and suggest those to her daughter. they could
    have a lively discussion of character development, narratives, etc. keeping the
    communication going is the most important aspect of all. forbidding her daughter

    i was recently placed in an uncomfortable situation. "adam," a 43-year-old married
    co-worker, was using myspace.com to contact me four and five times a day on my
    days off. the messages culminated when he told me he was crazy about me and would
    like to "kiss and cuddle outside of work." abby, i am 20 and very happy in my
    current relationship. i told adam i would be neither interested nor comfortable
    doing that with him. he was going through a rough patch in his life at the time,
    so i didn''t report him to management because it would have gotten him fired,
    and he and his family couldn''t afford for him to lose his job. however, adam
    has approached every single young female at the company with a similar proposition
    at one point or another. it is fairly common knowledge, and no one has spoken
    up about it. adam now talks to me at work only when necessary and has stopped
    contacting me on my days off, but the whole situation feels weird, and i know
    in the future another girl will inevitably be put in the same situation i was.
    adam has already been disciplined several times for saying inappropriate things
    and, while i don''t want to punish his family for his bad behavior by costing
    him his job, i also don''t want any other girl to be made uncomfortable because
    of him. any suggestions? -- had it in davenport, iowa'

    i am 14 and a freshman in high school. i have been best friends with a girl i''ll
    call tracy ever since third grade. two years ago, tracy''s father was killed in
    a car accident, and it''s like she hasn''t grown since. my problem is, she treats
    me differently now. she has said it''s because i bring back memories of her dad
    and it hurts her, but i''m the one being hurt. tracy and i have only one class
    together, but we see each other every day during lunch. she rarely talks to me
    when we''re around my friends, and if she does, it''s not always a nice comment.
    she admitted a few days ago it''s because she thinks i am smart and she isn''t.
    my parents have asked me again and again if i really want to be her friend, and
    i have answered "yes" every time. but i''m tired of the way she treats our friendship.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    over the years, americans have incorporated fire safety into their daily lives
    by installing smoke alarms in their homes and developing an escape plan for their
    family to follow in the event of a fire. these measures have saved lives and prevented
    injuries. however, few people consider the risks associated with a common activity
    that most of us participate in daily: cooking. did you know that unattended cooking
    is a leading cause of home fires? three out of 10 home fires begin in the kitchen,
    more than any other room in the home. home cooking fires kill hundreds of americans
    and injure roughly 4,000 more each year. many of these fires are avoidable. this
    year, the national fire protection association is focusing its annual public awareness
    campaign, fire prevention week (oct. 8 to 14), on cooking safety, urging the public
    to "prevent cooking fires: watch what you heat!" how can people be safer from
    cooking fires at home? just follow a few basic safety guidelines while working
    in the kitchen: never leave cooking unattended while frying, grilling, broiling
    or boiling, and if you must leave for even a short period of time, turn off the
    stove. if you are simmering or baking something over a longer period, check it
    regularly. remain in the home and use a timer to remind you that the stove or
    oven is on. and avoid wearing loose clothing with dangling sleeves while cooking,
    as it could catch fire if it comes in contact with a gas flame or electric burner.
    i hope that everyone reading this letter will add safety to their list of ingredients
    as they prepare their next meal. -- james m. shannon, president, national fire

    something happened to me in one of the most popular restaurants here in town.
    i have gone there many times with family and friends. recently a friend took me
    there for a birthday dinner. i know the manager, so i stopped to talk to him when
    we entered. as we were talking, the hostess came to take my friend to be seated,
    and i asked, "could we have a booth, please?" this was not an unusual request.
    i have asked before because it''s a more intimate way to have girl-talk. when
    i went to look for my friend, she was being seated at a tiny table for two, and
    i remarked, "are there no booths available?" the hostess replied, "the tables
    don''t move in the booths." i told her i knew what the booths were like. she then
    demonstrated how you could pull the chairs up to the little table. all of a sudden
    it dawned on me what the hostess was getting at. i said, "are you insinuating
    that i won''t fit in your booths?" and she pointed to my stomach! i was mortified!
    i am heavy, but not obese. i was humiliated and the restaurant was crowded, so
    we sat down and ordered. it was a quick meal; i was too upset to eat. when i got
    home and settled down, i called and asked for the manager. as i started to tell
    him what happened, he said, "oh yeah, she told me," and added, "we do the best
    we can." he just sloughed me off! needless to say, i haven''t been back. what

    i could not believe your response to "had it in arlington, wash." you said, "children
    behave as they have been taught, usually by their mothers." how incredibly insulting
    to mothers everywhere. let me tell you that when i went through a divorce, it
    was their father who "taught" them such despicable behavior! my ex-husband was
    so bitter, he did not want my children to give me anything -- on birthdays, mother''s
    day or christmas. in fact, i was the one who took them to the store and gave them
    money to buy gifts for their father on each and every occasion, even though it
    was not reciprocated. at one point, my son asked me as i drove them to the store
    to get a gift for their father''s birthday, "why do you care, mom? he doesn''t
    care about you!" let me add that the christmas that i gave them enough money to
    buy everyone (including me) gifts, their father would let them spend only $10
    on a gift certificate for me, regardless of what they knew i wanted and they had
    wanted to buy for me! shame on you, dear abby, for making such a hurtful comment.

    two days later, to clarify notification of family and friends so there would be

    is good, and we get along better now than we ever have in our marriage. before
    we get any older, my husband has asked me to visit a nudist beach or resort with

    forest beside a mountain stream, or even the back seat of our car in a secluded
    spot. coming from a religious background, i am not totally comfortable with the
    idea of going nude at a beach in front of a lot of other people, or the thought
    of being caught having sex in the woods. my husband says that visiting a nudist
    beach or resort is not about exhibitionism or immorality. he says it is about
    enjoying nature and feeling the sensation of being free outdoors. to be honest,
    these are things i might like to try, but i am just not sure. i''m concerned about

    when my husband and i recently hosted a week-long family reunion for 40 relatives
    at our lakeside cottage, one family arrived with toys that included slingshots
    and a bow with rubber-tipped arrows. to my horror, their 7-year-old son, "andy,"
    shot an arrow directly into a group of his cousins. i screamed his name, and he
    stopped and didn''t shoot the other arrows. i explained that he could hurt someone
    and he should never shoot into a crowd, etc. andy''s father was annoyed with me
    for shouting at his son and kept muttering that a rubber-tipped arrow could never
    hurt anyone. the next morning, i saw andy aim his bow and arrow at another cousin
    only a few feet away. horrified, i shouted, "andy!" and the closest adult removed
    the bow and arrow from his hands. andy then started crying and threw himself on
    his mother''s lap, where he sobbed and wailed for one solid hour. someone told
    me i had "humiliated" the boy. i was very disturbed and could not understand the
    parents'' nonchalance about the possible danger. the next morning i apologized
    to andy and his parents for "humiliating" him. i explained i was concerned that
    someone would get hurt. andy smiled and nodded yes in agreement, that he understood.
    his mother also smiled at me and gave me a "thumbs up." all appeared to be forgiven

    leaving, that they couldn''t wait to say goodbye to their grandfather, who was
    hiking with other family members. the family left without saying another word

    bear hugs, where he puts both arms around the woman and presses her breasts against

    several women have complained, and family members have cautioned uncle harry about
    his behavior. he will stop temporarily, and then start up again in a few days.

    hug babies and friends all the time. but she has now banned the children from
    playing together! this causes problems because eric often plays at his cousins''
    house, which is right next door to mine. when geneva drops eric off next door,
    the neighbors get the unpleasant job of telling my daughter she isn''t welcome
    in their yard, where she has always played with their kids. and i get to try and
    explain to her why everything has changed. abby, geneva will not return my phone
    calls, and i don''t know how to make things right. also, i fear that if a hug
    elicits this kind of reaction, her son may just be more intrigued with physical
    affection. should i keep leaving messages on her answering machine, or drop it
    and write her off as a nasty woman? -- vexed in illinois'

    i am a 28-year-old divorced man dating a wonderful 24-year-old woman. she lights
    up my life and is very kind to my daughter and me. i love her very much. however,
    there is a problem -- her 7-year-old son. everything seemed fine at first. he
    got along pretty well with my 5-year-old daughter, playing and having a good time.
    as time went on, though, my daughter told me about strange sexual comments he
    made to her. at first i thought he just had a dirty mouth, as his mother lacks
    somewhat in the discipline department. but this is turning into a problem. my
    daughter recently reported that he told her he was going "to have sex with her."
    he has been investigated by child protective services on two occasions for similar
    behavior around other children. so now the children are no longer allowed to be
    together at all because i refuse to have my daughter talked to like that by anyone.
    i have her one week on, one week off. i cannot imagine combining families at this
    point when her child has so many problems. it''s not that i don''t want to help
    him; it''s that i need to protect my daughter. i love his mother very much, though,
    and feel terrible about what she''s going through. is this relationship worth
    working for, or is this little family "damaged goods"? -- wondering in washington'

    could get together. she has even asked us to stop by on our next trip up there.

    my 14-year-old daughter, "jessica," is mature for her age and a straight-a student.
    she is entering her freshman year of high school. she is an avid reader, and i
    have recently found cause to be concerned about what she''s reading. abby, jessica
    is reading adult romance novels that feature what i consider to be content that
    is too mature and erotic for a child her age to read. i have told her to stop
    buying them, but i know she''s still sneaking them into the house because i found
    some when i went into her room to clean. what should i do? i''m uncomfortable
    about her reading this type of material. what will it do to her future relationships
    and her judgment of what''s acceptable and not acceptable in those relationships?
    we have argued over this. jessica says there is nothing in the books that she
    didn''t already know about, and having learned about sex and relationships in
    school, there is no reason why she shouldn''t be allowed to read what she wants.
    is she right? am i being overprotective? or will her current reading choices cause
    future problems? -- nervous in bernardsville, n.j.'

    i am 22 and in college. i have been dating "andy" for two years. he is also a
    college student and somewhat of an introvert. two years ago, andy''s parents gave
    him a video game for christmas. there is a monthly payment to play it. well, andy
    got hooked. he has spent thousands of hours on this game. when he crawls out of
    bed in the morning, the first thing he does is go to his computer to "check things."
    he plays many hours a day. it was ok in the beginning. i thought that i''d rather
    see him at home playing games than out getting into trouble with some other girl,
    but it has gone too far. andy is 21 and he needs to get a job. his parents have
    told him so, over and over. but all his energy gets devoted to the game, and very
    little into looking for employment or even being social. many people have expressed
    their frustration with his gaming so much, but to no avail. should i talk to andy''s
    parents about how bad it has become and suggest that maybe they stop paying for
    it? by continuing to do so they are only enabling him. or should i let them figure
    it out on their own? -- worried sick in santa barbara'

    about a month ago, i was shocked out of my shoes. my longtime friend, "orville,"
    told me he had bought $280 worth of women''s clothes. he went on to describe how
    "great" it feels to wear them. he says he has been a cross-dresser since boyhood

    we always have a large birthday party for my 8-year-old daughter every year. we
    hold the party later in the evening when we know people can come if it falls on
    a weekday because of work. my sister returned to college this year, and i knew
    she could not come because she had a class that evening. so i asked my husband
    if we should have the party on another day or on the weekend. he said, "no, we''re
    having it on her birthday in the evening, and if they can''t come, they can see
    her at a later date." he said, what if they can''t come on the weekend either?
    so the party stayed the same. football started that night for my other sister
    and her son, and my husband''s sister had to work late. i feel like a heel! i
    agree that i don''t want my daughter''s party to be a week or two after her birthday,
    and i don''t want to combine mine with hers, since they are two days apart. what

    i am working temporarily as a receptionist. i get tired of greeting people, but
    i put on a smile and do it. but it upsets me when i make contact with someone
    and say, "good morning," only to have him or her look away and ignore me. would
    it be ok to say, "excuse me, i said, ''good morning''"? if not, how do you suggest
    dealing with rude people like these? i think they should be made aware of their

    i''m 26 and have never wanted children. last year, however, two lines appeared
    on a pregnancy test and 41 weeks later the girl was born. i pleaded and begged
    my husband throughout the pregnancy to sign adoption papers with me. he refused.
    he is in the military and was gone through most of the last seven months. we now
    live thousands of miles from my family, and i am miserable, stuck with a colicky
    baby who still doesn''t sleep through the night. i find no joy, no pleasure and
    no love being a mother. i can''t sleep knowing i must wake up to a crying baby
    and the same routine of feeding, diapers, baths and bottles. i have become more
    and more detached from the girl and have nothing to enjoy. showers are short.
    dinners are rushed and usually cold. i can''t even enjoy a cup of coffee without
    looking over my shoulder to see where the girl is. i don''t want her to touch
    me, and i can barely hide my revulsion when i have to pick her up. i am exhausted
    beyond belief, and my thoughts are turning darker every day. it''s not the girl''s
    fault she was born, but i can''t help feeling resentment and anger toward this
    little person who more and more resembles a block of concrete on my feet. we can''t
    afford day care, and we have no friends or relatives remotely close by. i can''t
    stand to wake up much longer, and these long stretches of crying have my nerves
    shot and my hands itching to shake the girl until she shuts up. (i have never
    shaken her.) i''m scared of my feelings. what''s wrong with me? why can''t i love
    my child? should i put her in foster care? my husband can''t stand her, either,
    but he''s adamant that we keep her. yet i''m suffering, and so is she. she deserves

    i just read the letter from "perturbed in n. carolina" (july 20) describing the

    my husband''s stepsister, "melanie," visits us from alabama for five days every

    didn''t want her making dinner because she goes through my kitchen drawers and
    cabinets without asking where anything is. she just takes over my kitchen! i don''t
    mind if melanie helps herself to something in the refrigerator, gets a plate and
    silverware or something of that nature. but for her to come in and take over my
    kitchen and root through every drawer and cabinet truly upsets me. lawton went

    even stand to be in my own kitchen while she was preparing it. i felt i couldn''t
    say one word in my own home. lawton accused me of being "hostile" to her and a

    comes to visit, she''s allowed to do whatever she wants. am i wrong in feeling

    my boyfriend, "zack," has been a bartender for many years. he has a terrible time

    i am an exchange student in germany, nearing the end of my stay and going home
    in a couple of weeks. to express their gratitude to my host family for taking
    me in, my parents sent them a large package of sweets and candies from america.

    candies my parents sent to school and share them with his class for his birthday.

    family. and i was even more shocked that no one in the family seemed to understand
    how this could be interpreted as ungrateful and rude. after she made the suggestion,
    i interjected, saying that it would be mean to take it to school. they all replied
    with a surprised "why?" i later explained to my host sister that i didn''t want
    her brother to take the candies to school. again i was asked, "why not?" what

    speaking as a criminal defense attorney who handles domestic violence cases on

    for doing something so simple as sending a birthday card, or merely being present
    at the same high school graduation, as the person who holds the order. is this

    i am thinking about trying something unusual, and i would like your opinion. i
    am a divorced mother of two who is fortunate to have an excellent relationship
    with my ex-husband and his wife. we all believe that the children come first.
    for many reasons, i believe the best arrangement may be for all of us to live
    together. i have found a house with a lovely remodeled basement with a separate
    entrance. i could live there, and my ex and his wife could have the upstairs.
    we would not have to venture into each other''s space unless invited, but the
    children would have easy access to all of us. obviously, there are details to
    work out, but we think we are all mature enough to handle them. have you ever

    my mother has had a "best friend" for many years. "joan" has had many problems
    in her life that mom has seen her through. joan has helped my mother through some
    rough times, too, particularly through the death of my father 10 years ago. joan
    can sometimes be very difficult to be around because she constantly seeks attention
    and tends to become rather dramatic. she seems to take pleasure in the idea she
    has it worse than anyone else. a few weeks ago, joan, who is a massage therapist,
    was giving a massage to my best friend, "becky." becky later informed me that
    during the 45-minute massage, joan bad-mouthed my mother and disclosed some personal
    problems that mom has confided to joan. should i tell my mom about this? it would
    crush her if i do; my mom has been through some big changes and isn''t exactly
    emotionally stable at the moment. but i can''t let joan go around bad-mouthing
    my mom, her supposed "friend." should i tell my mother that joan is leaking personal

    until recently, i lived happily in my apartment complex. all that changed when
    some neighbors moved in. "greg" and his girlfriend, "suzy," smoke what i believe
    is marijuana. i let the landlord know, and she had a talk with them. of course
    they denied everything and swore that they do not smoke anything in their room.
    the landlord then spoke to me and said there is not much he can do about the problem.
    abby, the smell is terrible. my closet abuts the area in which they smoke, and
    my clothing is permeated. people have asked me if i smoke dope. i tell them i
    don''t, and leave it at that. my concern is that i will be working for a school
    district soon and i''m afraid my colleagues may think the same thing, and it will
    put me in a bad light with the school administration. my neighbors smoke 24/7,
    and i don''t know what other options i have. my landlord says they have to be

    my grandmother is 88 and in good health. she has lived with my dad''s sister ("aunt
    joy") and her family since grandpa died nine years ago. grandma doesn''t have
    a mother-in-law suite or anything like that -- just her own bedroom and bath --
    but she pays them between $600 and $700 in rent every month. furthermore, aunt
    joy charges grandma a percentage of everything they do to improve the house. aunt
    joy had granite countertops put in; grandma paid $1,200 for the use of them. they
    also had a fence installed and charged grandma 25 percent of the cost. i think
    my aunt is very materialistic. she uses grandma and her money to get what she
    wants. grandma isn''t rich, but she has enough to live on her own if she wanted
    to. it''s also interesting that their daughter, who is 27, lives with them and
    pays no rent at all. why should my grandma have to pay so much and my cousin nothing?
    my parents would love for grandma to come and live here in our guestroom for free,

    i am now married and have no intention of getting rid of it. i guess i''ve held

    husband says he doesn''t mind, and i''m sure he''s not lying, but it''s a little
    embarrassing. i can''t fall asleep without it. i even watch tv with it in my lap

    volume of her cell phone isn''t what bothers me as much as the fact that her visits
    are disturbed by her social life. if it were a call from work, or some emergency

    pretty stressful. i kept my cool because i was dealing with explosives. after
    three attempts to find out what building they belonged in, this one employee told
    me "not to get my panties in a bunch." i told my boss what happened and demanded
    an apology. it has yet to happen. i am a contract worker. do i have a right to
    report this on my own? i know the name of the person who said it. i had to go
    to the hospital because my blood pressure was 166/109, and i had pain in my chest
    and dizziness. then i had to go back to the doctor the next day for a checkup.
    what are my rights? -- unsure of what to do'

    i am a 29-year-old woman, married with two sons, 7 and 8. my husband of nine years
    and i try to set a good example and teach them the difference between right and
    wrong. my mother is dating a man who has been married for many years. mom and
    this married man have been "dating" for about four years. he says he''s miserable
    and still married only because a divorce would lose him half his assets. i know
    there will come a day when our boys find out that "grandpa" is married to someone
    else. my husband and i have taught our children that marriage is a faithful and
    truthful act that only two people who love each other very much should engage
    in. we have also taught them that marriage is forever -- until death do us part.
    how do i answer the questions i know are going to follow? please don''t tell me
    to let grandma tell them the story. her take on the situation may warp our kids''

    when i was 16 i fell in love with the handsomest man i had ever seen. i''ll call
    him "todd." apparently everyone else thought so, too. todd loved the women and
    they loved him, and our relationship ended. after many years we were reunited.
    we have been together for three years now. todd has changed a lot since high school.
    his personality is every woman''s dream now. he is thoughtful, considerate, and
    tells me he loves me every day. he has apologized repeatedly for his past. the
    problem is, he''s no longer as attractive as he used to be. over the years he
    has neglected his body, teeth, skin and hair. he is a diesel mechanic, and his
    hands and fingernails are embedded with grease. we no longer look like we belong
    together, and i''m embarrassed to introduce him to friends. (they chuckle under
    their breath when they see him.) my friends and i like to go to fancy places,
    and even when todd is dressed up, he doesn''t look right. forgive me if this seems
    shallow. i have kept my youthful looks. i still wear a size 8, and no one can
    believe i have three grandchildren. how do i deal with this? i love todd. i love
    being with him and talking to him. but i can''t seem to overcome these feelings.

    "rita" and i first became close in junior high. we are both in our mid-20s and
    currently live about two hours apart. we spent many hours together as teens. however,
    her demanding nature did always grate on me. one year, when we were living on
    opposite coasts, i sent rita an expensive birthday gift and card, but forgot to
    call her until the next day. instead of thanking me, she pouted and accused me
    of "not valuing our friendship." a few months ago, rita sent me an angry e-mail
    because i had made plans with my boyfriend for two nights during her week-long
    stay in my town. (she was here for the wedding of a couple i do not know.) i wrote
    her back, explaining that i love her, but i am now a busy woman and don''t have
    time for her childish behavior. i told her she expects a degree of attention that
    i cannot give her. we haven''t spoken since. recently rita e-mailed me and invited
    me to lunch. i have not responded. i simply have no desire to see her, as i have
    not enjoyed our relationship for years. do i owe rita anything besides wishing
    her the best? should i see her? -- feeling guilty in palo alto'

    he flirts with waitresses and leaves them big tips from the money i work hard
    for. he has his own web site and often comes across singers who want him to promote
    their music. he has had several love affairs over the internet. on our first anniversary,
    i found out he didn''t tell a certain soprano he was married, and she had fallen
    in love with him. she hit the c above high c when i called to let her know we
    had received her sexy pictures. she said earl had asked her to marry him. the
    most recent singer started calling him "honey" and "darling," and he was calling
    her "sweetheart." she knew he was married. i don''t know what lies he told her
    to make her believe he''s available. i would kick him out and divorce him, but
    he would die. i have to take care of earl because his diabetes is so bad he can''t

    can i break him of having these e-mail lovers? everything we own was mine before
    we married. all he had was an old pickup truck and his music. why can''t he appreciate

    walking down the aisle chewing gum to funeral pallbearers wearing tennis shoes,
    to members wearing flip-flops, shorts and tank tops on sunday, the lack of respect

    about how wonderful a certain news anchor was, and said, "she has eight children!"

    my comment may have been off-color, but we''ve known each other 20 years, and
    i was just mouthing off. the woman who had brought up the newscaster immediately
    took great offense and replied, "my mother had eight children!" the lady whose
    81st birthday we were celebrating then said, "your mother must have liked to do
    it, too." the offended lady told us angrily that she didn''t appreciate our remarks.
    i was very embarrassed and apologized repeatedly, both for myself and the honoree
    -- who, i can assure you, meant no harm either. then i had my lunch packed up,
    paid my share of the bill, and left. i told my husband what happened, and he assured
    me that i had done nothing wrong. the offended woman brought her mother into the
    discussion, and the lady whose birthday it was made the comment about her mother.

    my heart goes out to "frightened but curious," who not only had to endure being

    15 or 20 years ago. back then, that kind of thing was often swept under the rug

    somehow to blame. those cruel classmates most likely have children of their own

    the granddaughter of a close friend of mine canceled her wedding plans, for justifiable
    reasons. no invitations had been sent, so there were no wedding gifts to return,
    as i know is proper. about nine months ago, my friend had an elegant engagement
    celebration for her granddaughter and the then-fiance, and although it was just
    supposed to be a great party for all of us who love this girl and her grandmother,
    everyone gave gifts, either monetary ones or items from a bridal registry. the
    guy made off with all the money and the gifts. there is no legal way the girl
    can get them, and yet her grandmother and, i guess, the girl herself feel that
    everything from that engagement celebration should be returned to us. so they
    are trying to do it themselves. i, for one, told them to forget it, because there
    was a party and there was an engagement, but some of our mutual friends said that
    they should, in one way or another, repay those who gave. is it necessary to return
    gifts, or is it just adding another financial burden to an already strapped girl

    what is your take on these two similar situations? we were recently invited to
    attend a surprise birthday party for a man in his late 40s. we were all to meet
    at a lovely restaurant. somehow he found out the day before and called each guest,
    saying he had "other plans and the party is off." (a blatant excuse.) how about
    another grown man, my neighbor? i had invited his family over for a small, casual
    dinner at my home on his birthday. immediately upon entering, he saw the cake,
    said, "i don''t celebrate my birthday!" slammed the door and left. he didn''t
    even say "thanks anyway." is this considered normal behavior? i was trying to
    show his daughter -- my goddaughter -- that you "receive by giving," but it sure
    backfired. i wasn''t trying to embarrass him, just show him that we love him.
    i will keep my opinions about these men to myself. let''s just say, i''m still

    i am an outdoorsman with 20-plus years of experience in backpacking and camping.
    i''m very happy that the woman i''m planning to marry enjoys these activities
    with me, but she has very little experience. last christmas, she bought a tent

    comparing models and trying to find the perfect one. she was very excited to see
    me tear off the wrapping paper, and i truly appreciate her affection and effort.
    however, the tent she purchased is much too heavy and bulky to use for backpacking.
    we are young and have modest incomes, and we both value thriftiness, so should
    i ask her to return the tent and purchase one that would be more suitable for
    our adventures? or should i keep quiet, purchase the lightweight tent that i desire,
    and use her gift just when she and i are traveling together on less demanding

    over the last three years, my best friend of 15 years, "hazel," has engaged in
    some disturbing internet dating behavior. several months ago, she answered a classified
    ad on the internet in which a man was looking for women who enjoy "domestic discipline."
    (in other words, "spanking.") not only did hazel go to meet this man in person,
    but she married him after knowing him for only three weeks! when i met him in
    person, every alarm god ever gave me as a woman went off at once. he was very
    aggressive and began making inappropriate comments in front of me about spanking
    her after knowing me for less than 10 minutes. hazel keeps pressing for us to
    "get to know him," but every time i think about it i feel ill. my husband and
    i are conservative people. we would never associate with someone we knew openly
    practiced deviant behavior. however, i am concerned for my friend. i''m afraid
    he may abuse her. i don''t want to associate with him, but i don''t want to lose
    hazel. can this relationship be salvaged? -- shocked in tempe, ariz.'

    he found out that he has a son a year and a half older than our oldest. my children
    welcomed "ricky" and so did i. now the problem: john wants us to treat ricky like
    family, but ricky doesn''t have to treat us like family. we never hear from this
    child; only my husband talks to him. when ricky visits, john waits on him hand
    and foot and acts like the perfect father. he pretends he doesn''t hear ricky
    make rude comments about me and my children. ricky can tell john that one of my
    children -- or i -- said something to upset him, and it is automatically our fault,
    no questions asked. if ricky wants money, i am not consulted. i am told we are
    sending it -- regardless of the amount. i understand john may feel guilty for
    not being in ricky''s life all those years, but that''s not our fault. i think
    that if ricky doesn''t accept us, then we should be left out of it. but when he
    comes here, john wants us all to be present. why should we be there for the rude
    comments? if i say anything about it, john says i don''t love his child. i no

    my husband, "hans," and i have decided not to allow our two children to visit
    their grandparents'' home while my sister-in-law, "becky," is living there. the
    reason for our decision is that becky molested hans for about four years while
    they were kids. becky has kids of her own now and has said some things that are
    questionable. we feel our children would be better off without her in their lives,
    just to be safe. hans'' parents do not know what happened. he simply told them
    he has "good reason" for not allowing his children over, and not much else was
    said. my problem is, my in-laws are blaming me for the children not going over
    there, and now refuse to visit with us at our house. hans'' mother barely speaks
    to him anymore. they live only 15 minutes away and both are under 50 and in good
    health. were we wrong in our decision? do you think hans should tell his parents
    why we don''t visit? as with many cases of sexual abuse, becky convinced hans
    that no one would believe him if he "told," and unfortunately, that thought has
    stuck with him. -- desperate to mend the family'

    my name is "alicia" and i''m 16. about a year ago, my mom got two puppies. although
    they are annoying, i have to admit they are very cute and adorable. my problem
    is, ever since we''ve had the puppies, i have thought my mom loves them more than
    she loves my brother and me. for some reason, i feel replaced by them. i know
    she loves us very much, but it hurts to think she cares more for them than she
    cares for us. i think that because my brother and i are getting older, she needs
    something else to love. sometimes i just want to sit and cry, but i have never
    been a person to spill my guts out to my parents. can you give me any advice that
    would help me with this? -- replaced by dogs in massachusetts'

    my friend and i have one teacher who is beginning to scare us. he says things

    us and give us an occasional hug. we have been trying to ignore it because, when
    we told my mom, she said he probably didn''t mean anything and was just trying
    to be nice. but at a school dance, he gave my friend a kiss on her cheek and put
    his hands on my waist. maybe we''re overreacting, but, abby, we are the only two

    i have a good friend, "cathy," whose 11-year-old son, "evan," is a friend of my

    "stupid," "idiot" and "butthead" when talking to my son, but noah has always laughed
    it off or told him to cut it out. today noah told me he no longer wants to play

    today i witnessed what may be the end of a marriage, and it was because of a professional

    was one large recovery room where patients coming out of anesthesia were grouped.
    (there were curtains separating the patients.) while i was waiting for my wife
    to awaken, i overheard a nurse talking to the wife of the patient next to us.
    she said, "you know, you can find out anything from them when they''re coming
    out of anesthesia. they are completely incapable of lying." she said it in a lighthearted
    way -- sort of giggling. a few minutes later, i heard the wife ask in a hushed
    voice, "bart, have you ever cheated on me?" "yes," he moaned, "with mary helen."
    i heard the wife choke back a sob and she ran from the room. it was another 45
    minutes before my wife was ready to leave, and the woman did not return during

    i recently got a phone call from a woman i hadn''t heard from in 30 years. "vivian"
    and i once had a short fling. we had a long talk, catching up, and she said she
    had gotten my number from my sister, who lives out of state. i was surprised not
    only to hear from vivian, but also that she lives only 25 miles away. she mentioned
    that when she moved south 19 years ago, she worked in a law enforcement office.
    when i spoke with my sister, she said that when vivian contacted her, vivian told
    her she had always loved me and was going to marry me. all of a sudden, i began
    getting letters from her -- but i never gave her my address. in every letter she
    would pour her heart out to me, but never included her return address. she would
    call me, sometimes three times a day. i didn''t answer because she was coming
    on too strong. every message vivian left was full of emotion, sometimes sobbing,
    telling me how much she loves me and wants to be with me. a few nights ago, she
    showed up at my door, demanding to know why i was "avoiding her." i didn''t invite
    her in. we sat on my front porch, and i had a long talk with her. i explained
    that a lot has changed in both our lives; i had come out as gay and was just out
    of a 10-year relationship. i said i was feeling depressed and confused, and didn''t
    want to get into a relationship with anyone -- male or female -- at this time.
    my being gay didn''t faze her. she seemed to think she could change me instantly.
    as our conversation progressed, she admitted that she had gone back to the law
    enforcement office and some of the old employees had done a search on me. they
    told her where i was living and gave her directions on how to get to my home,
    information on how many vehicles i own and the license numbers, and who knows
    what else. i feel violated. i feel vivian has crossed a very fine line. i feel
    i''m being stalked, and it''s giving me nightmares. was what she did legal, and
    how should i handle this? -- violated in the south'

    you missed an opportunity with the 13-year-old girl who is dissatisfied with her
    bedroom and always the recipient of hand-me-downs. telling her to get a trusted
    adult to speak on her behalf was tantamount to advising her to recruit someone
    to help her whine. at 13, she''s old enough to be more proactive in making her
    room the way she wants it. her dresser and closet are overstuffed with hand-me-downs
    that no longer fit? grab a box, pull out everything that doesn''t fit, fold it
    neatly and put it in the box. these, and the neatly stacked hangers, can be donated
    to the salvation army -- or another group -- and she''ll have a lot of new space.
    her furniture is rickety? can it be glued, clamped, made sturdy again and repainted?
    the computer is in the study? maybe she should clear off her desk and make room
    for it in her room. she doesn''t like white walls? what if she offered to paint
    them herself if her parents supply the paint? she should clear out, refurbish,
    redecorate and grow up! she complains about her pitiable situation, which she

    or compassion for her parents who are working, taking care of multiple children

    my husband is a college professor. his department wanted the faculty to have web
    pages with a "personal" touch, so they ordered each faculty member to have a photograph
    taken to post on them. if they chose not to display their own pictures, they could
    post a picture of something they like or that represents their particular field
    of study. my husband decided to post a picture of michelangelo''s "david" on his
    web page. i just about flipped when i saw it. i asked him why he chose that one,
    and he had numerous excuses, none of them to my satisfaction. my husband does
    not teach anything remotely tied to the "david," michelangelo, art, italy, renaissance

    i''ll get right to the point. i have fallen in love with my sister''s boyfriend
    and he with me, so he says. we have been lovers from the first moment we realized
    our feelings for each other were mutual, and have been hiding them from my sister
    ever since. "greg" is not only handsome, but he listens to whatever i say, takes
    it into thoughtful consideration and gives me honest feedback. i have tried to
    let him go and found it quite impossible. he is the most precious thing in my
    life and he has my whole heart. since this has been going on, i have become more
    and more confused about how i should act, what i should say and do. however, my
    love for greg grows. i don''t want to hurt my sister, but we were never very close
    to begin with. is this relationship worth my pain and great love? -- little sister

    often, when i have a dental appointment, it will be scheduled in the late morning
    -- around 10 or 11. i think it would be terrible manners to eat before going,
    and have the dentist dig through the food in my teeth. after the actual cleaning
    and then following the instruction of waiting before the next meal, it could be
    as late as 1 p.m. in the afternoon before i get my first meal of the day. some
    people have good stamina, i suppose, but it is very hard for me to wait that long.

    after reading the letter from "married? in arkansas," who found to her dismay
    that her husband was still married to his first wife, i thought i should write.
    it happens more than people would like to think. i have worked for more than 10
    years on a divorce court staff, and i would advise all divorced people -- male
    and female -- to request a certified copy of their divorce decree. this official
    document is available from the courthouse in which they were divorced. i know
    of at least two instances where the lawyers failed to submit the decree of divorce
    to the judge. it was only discovered more than a decade later. in the first instance,
    as part of the property settlement, the husband was going to buy out his ex-wife''s
    interest in the former marital home. the provision was triggered by the youngest
    child turning 18. the mortgage company needed a copy of the divorce decree to
    refinance the mortgage. surprise -- both the husband and wife had remarried! they
    had to go through another divorce proceeding. (it was probably more amicable than
    the first.) but they were humiliated, not to mention furious at the attorney.
    then they had to "remarry" their current spouses. the second incident was very
    sad. the parties'' son was killed in an accident. in the process of filing a wrongful
    death action, a copy of their divorce decree was needed. that''s when they learned
    their case had been dismissed for "failure to prosecute." again, the attorney
    had not filed the judgment, even though the parties had appeared in court and
    testified. please, abby, tell your readers if they have gotten a divorce and do
    not have a certified copy of their divorce decree, to get one now. most attorneys
    are hard-working and honest. but it never hurts to have insurance, and this is
    some of the cheapest insurance they''ll ever get. -- concerned court reporter'

    please help me. i''m 14, the oldest of four children. the second youngest is "rose."
    she''s 8 and was the baby of the family until about three years ago, when mother
    became pregnant. needless to say, rose was not happy with the news. when we were
    told a few months later that the baby would be a girl, rose cried and said she
    wanted a boy. then, when baby "claire," was born, rose had a temper tantrum because
    she wasn''t the baby anymore. rose had been so used to being doted on and getting
    everything she wanted -- and here came this new baby. now rose is continually
    abusing claire. she will scream at claire for just moving something out of place.
    for instance, rose was dancing to some music in the family room, and claire came
    in with a laundry basket. rose went nuts. she turned and screamed, "get out! i''m
    dancing, you idiot!" then she went and gave claire the biggest slap on the shoulder!

    i''m writing in response to your reply to the gal in her 20s who looks like she''s

    hair won''t change her looks, and makeup is designed to emphasize them. trust
    me; i tried for a dozen years. (i avoid pigtails, though.) at work, avoid greetings
    like "hi" and "hello" and introduce yourself with your title and last name. (example:
    "good afternoon, i''m ms. doe. how may i help you?") at social events, introduce
    yourself by your first and last names. (example: "i''m jane doe. pleased to meet
    you.") mind your mannerisms. stand up straight, look people in the eye, give a
    firm handshake and enunciate when you speak. if it''s not someone you''ll be dealing
    with regularly, or professionally, ignore the person''s comments. it''s not worth
    your time. and if all else fails, look the person straight in the eye, flash a

    the check themselves. instead of stepping up to the plate and insisting on paying
    for at least some of the dinners, kyle nonchalantly will ask something to the
    effect of, "do i need to put anything in?" abby, i''m usually very accepting of

    after being single for several years, i met the man of my dreams. "chet" was everything

    for nearly a year our relationship has been bliss. chet seems to be completely
    devoted to me. he told me when we first met that his wife had died seven years
    ago from diabetes. he seemed upset at the memory of her loss, and i never pressed
    him for more details. he wears a lock of her hair braided to his, and i never
    really thought much about it. well, chet took me "home" for the easter holiday.
    some things were casually said in passing, and his story began to unravel. after
    i got home i accessed public records and found in place of a death certificate,
    a judgment for divorce in 2001! i couldn''t believe that chet would lie to me.
    i felt such a deep connection to him. when i confronted him about it, he told
    me that to him, she is dead. he says he never looks back, only forward, and that
    he didn''t want to discuss it further. when i brought up the trust issue, he said
    he had never cheated on me or been with another woman -- completely ignoring the
    fact he''d lied. i could understand his wearing his deceased wife''s hair -- but

    our 24-year-old son was killed recently in an auto accident. we had long dreaded
    that his life might end like this. he had a history of many traffic tickets and
    a terrible driving record. he had totaled three vehicles in the last three years.
    the wreck that killed him was his fourth accident in three years. we have discovered
    that our son''s grandmother took out a large life insurance policy on him after
    the first accident. thinking that his own grandmother would "bet" on his death
    has made our grief even harder to bear. at first, when we confronted her, she
    said she had taken out the policy to ensure his proper burial because we have
    no money. (my wife was diagnosed with cancer 3 1/2 years ago, and the treatment
    left us destitute.) the policy is many times the cost of our son''s funeral. when
    the funeral director asked my wife and me in the presence of other relatives (including
    his grandmother), if there was a life insurance policy to defray the expenses,
    i turned and looked at her. she didn''t utter a word! we borrowed the money from
    my wife''s brother. we don''t want a penny of this "blood money" for ourselves
    or our son''s burial. but now our son''s grandmother is acting very hostile to

    from some newlyweds, "ike" and "tina," who moved into our apartment building a
    few weeks ago. this is the second time i''ve been awakened by their fighting.
    i hear loud thumps and bangs and cries from both of them. because we leave our
    windows ajar at night, we can also hear what they are shouting at each other.
    i am well aware that ike has hit tina on more than one occasion. the first time,
    i was tempted to run upstairs and "save" her. this time, i''m lying here wondering
    if i should call the police or write a personal note and leave it under the door.
    i don''t want to embarrass anyone or cause more problems. but i do want them to
    stop fighting. it breaks my heart. ike apologizes, then tina yells and he cries,
    and she says she wants to leave, and he begs her to stay. i hear the whole thing.

    i have a problem i don''t know how to solve. when we have family over for get-togethers,
    my "aunt irene," whom we all love, disappears and goes into our bedrooms -- we
    have three -- going from one to the other looking through our drawers. nothing
    has ever gone missing, so we can''t imagine what she''s looking for. the last
    time she stayed 45 minutes. when i asked aunt irene''s husband where she was,
    he got embarrassed. he tries to ignore it. i followed her once and asked what
    she was doing. she said, "just looking." my husband says i should close all the
    bedroom doors, but my oldest daughter had her door closed and aunt irene went
    in anyway. aunt irene always wants to be included and she''s good company, but
    she has this odd habit. how should we handle this? -- wondering in cleveland'

    after almost 30 years of marriage, my husband "grant," took a long-distance trucking
    job. this leaves me alone on many sundays and evenings, and i''m having a terrible
    time adjusting to it. i feel sad lots of times, like i''m living the life of a
    widow. being a widow is terrible, but living like one while your husband is still
    alive seems worse. i attend any social event that gives me contact with people
    while grant is away. sundays are difficult because i am limited to visiting older
    women who are widows. my children are grown and live hundreds of miles away, and
    i don''t want to impose on my married friends who have their husbands to do things
    with. absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, but it makes me feel
    distant and bitter. do other wives of airplane pilots, traveling salesmen, truckers,

    my son was an apache helicopter pilot in the army. he was active in the initial
    invasion of iraq and spent a year serving his country. it was a very difficult
    time for me. eventually i suffered a nervous breakdown from the stress. my son
    is now honorably discharged and safe at home. my problem is that friends keep
    sending me war-related e-mails and updates. if i know what they are by the subject
    line, i delete them. recently, i got an e-mail about a soldier whose job it was
    to inform the families when their loved ones had been killed. i had an emotional
    meltdown when i saw it. i know firsthand the fear that family members feel. i
    was driving my car when i heard an apache helicopter went down and two soldiers
    were taken hostage. i nearly crashed the vehicle. it could have been my son. it
    taught me not to listen to the news while driving. how do i tell everyone not
    to send me correspondence about the war and the goings-on in iraq? they have no

    from time to time you ask your readers to "dump on abby." well, summer is coming
    around again, and this message is for working parents who don''t realize they''re
    taking advantage of family and friends. so -- you drop off your children to play
    in the a.m. and pick them up in the p.m.? did you think to: pack a lunch? send
    a snack to share? rent a video? buy a pool toy? send a game? buy sunscreen? send
    a craft? cookie dough? juice? while working parents save money by sending their
    children to play all day, my food bill triples. the extra money i spend in pool
    chemicals, water, laundry and toys also triples. i choose to stay home with my
    children, and i love having their friends over. but every year seems to bring
    an even greater financial hardship. i don''t know how much more blunt "please
    send a snack to share" can be. if any of your readers see this, abby, and realize
    that they are one of those clueless working parents thinking stay-at-home moms
    "have it made," i''ll trade them my referee shirt, food bill and mess. please,
    folks, be grateful and considerate of the person who is watching and loving your
    child for free, and show your appreciation. -- anywhere, u.s.a.'

    a good time. this is enough to satisfy my need to "let loose," and i never do
    anything inappropriate. on several occasions when i have mentioned these girls''

    student! i don''t do this very often. i''m just out with friends, having fun.

    playing with our pets. it is now hunting season. my husband is gone for days at
    a time. we support each other. i have no problem with him doing things he likes,

    my husband, "ron," and i are at odds over parenting our 7-year-old son, "brett."
    my husband is very domestic. he cooks like a world-class chef and does more housework

    states that a father should be the manly role model for the son, to prevent the

    my husband, "quinn," and i have been married for two years. we''re college sweethearts

    as a very young girl in the early ''50s, i received by mail a beautiful string
    of pearls in a velvet case from my bachelor godfather. talk about age inappropriate!

    explained they were a special gift -- my "first pearls" -- to be worn when i became
    a young lady. the case graced my dresser top for years, until i was finally deemed
    "old enough" to wear the elegant necklace. i still cherish the pearls and their
    memories of a sweet godfather i rarely saw, and of the times i would carefully
    open that fancy case and rub the pearls against my cheek, daydreaming of someday

    "andrew" and i have been dating for about five years. we met just out of high
    school, when we were both young and still finding ourselves. but i have noticed
    that over the years, as we have grown and established our identities, we have
    become complete opposites. first, our religious beliefs: andrew and i were both
    raised catholic. he hasn''t practiced in years. when we met, i was going through
    a stage where i wasn''t really practicing my religion either. but as i continued
    through college, i realized i needed religion back in my life and began going
    to church. i am now active in the church, and my religious and spiritual beliefs
    are important to me. andrew, on the other hand, has no desire to go back and even
    says he has become an atheist. then there''s our families: andrew''s family is
    very free-spirited. not only are they opinionated and outspoken, they curse and
    talk about everything and anything. in contrast, my family is very reserved, well-mannered
    and gentle. we even pray before meals. needless to say, our families do not mesh
    well and have had little contact. i like chocolate; andrew likes vanilla. i like
    merry-go-rounds; he likes roller-coasters. i like winter; he likes summer. i''m
    a worrier; he''s carefree. i''m early; he''s late. you name it -- we''re opposites.
    it may have made for an exciting relationship when we were younger, but now that
    we''re talking marriage and children, i don''t see how this will work. our core
    values are too different. i really do care for andrew, and we have fun together,

    many young parents now teach their babies sign language, starting as newborns,
    helping them communicate before they learn the spoken word. by about 9 months,
    the child gets the concept and soon learns how to "sign" words such as "more,"
    "help," "milk," "sorry" and "thank you." the child is happier because his/her
    needs are communicated without frustration. both of my grandsons have learned
    to sign, and recently i was tickling my 14-month-old grandson, trying to get him

    after two years of dating, my boyfriend, "dan," and i have become engaged. dan
    was married before and has two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 10. i have no children
    of my own, so it has been a blessed, but sometimes bumpy road, accepting them
    into my life. for the most part, the girls and i get along well, but there is
    one issue that really bothers me. when we have the girls, the 10-year-old, "kelsey,"
    frequently parades around in her underwear, or attempts to sleep only in her underwear.
    i feel she''s too old to be doing this. i bought her several sets of pajamas to
    sleep in, thinking it would solve the problem. last night i caught her in only
    her underwear again. i told dan it bothers me, and his response was, "she''s only
    10." abby, kelsey is old enough to be going through puberty, so to me she is too
    old to go around without proper clothing. and even though she is an undeveloped
    10-year-old, i explained to dan that i want his daughters to grow up respecting
    themselves and their bodies. (i have also told this to kelsey.) i fear that kelsey
    does this at her mother''s and other relatives'' homes. their mother isn''t the
    most respectable person and, sad to say, was raised to be "trashy." i am trying

    my husband, "george," died seven months ago, after a four-month battle with esophageal
    cancer. he was the oldest of six siblings. we all got along well. my three children
    and i are grateful to both of our families for all the help they gave us throughout
    george''s illness. my problem is george''s brothers, sisters and their families.
    they have dropped us from their lives. i know they are grieving for their brother.
    my children and i are grieving for him, too. they say it''s "too hard to see us"
    because there are too many memories. abby, i like being with george''s family
    because they remind me of my husband. i don''t sit around talking about him all
    the time, and i don''t expect them to do that either. i guess what i''m looking
    for is a feeling of still belonging. i''m not talking about wanting to be with
    these people 24/7, just maybe seeing them once every two or three weeks. we all
    live close to each other. losing my husband was devastating, but losing his family
    makes it ever so much worse. how do i get them to see i need to stay in the family
    "loop"? -- george''s wife in new jersey'

    i am a 23-year-old male. ever since i was in middle school, i have been dealing
    with the possibility that i might be a homosexual. today i no longer think it''s
    a "possibility." i know it''s a fact. for years, not a day has gone by that i
    have not had homosexual thoughts and urges. i have dated a few females to try
    to "change," but those attempts have been unsuccessful. i am depressed, confused
    and angry with myself. i am becoming reclusive. i have withdrawn from most of
    my classes in college, and i don''t want to socialize with people. sometimes i
    think my life is over before it ever began. i come from a religious family in
    south georgia who believe that homosexuality is a sin and god will punish gays.
    in my part of the country, homophobia is everywhere. if i ever told anyone what
    i am feeling, i could never show my face around here again. i keep asking myself
    whether or not my life would be better if i told people that i am a homosexual.
    i am beginning to believe that if i come out, my life would be better. i''d do
    it now, but i couldn''t stand that my family would be disappointed with me --
    and i don''t want to lose what friends i have left. i also can''t bear the thought
    that my religious community would condemn me. what would you do if you were in
    my situation? -- confused in georgia'

    i have a delicate problem concerning my daughter-in-law, "sheila," and my 1-year-old
    grandson, "cary." i consider sheila to be an unfit mother. her house is filthy,
    including the kitchen. she allows cary to eat cat food when he crawls around on
    the dirty floors. sheila has been giving cary various medications since he was
    only a week old. when he would cry, she would give him drops to relieve "the gas."
    next, it was a gel for his teething ailments when he was only 3 months old --
    she still gives it to him three times a day. she has also been giving him tylenol
    every day "to help him sleep." abby, our grandson is beginning to look a bit yellow,
    and we''re afraid he may have some liver damage. we''re afraid to speak out because
    we don''t want to cause a rift in the family. i have considered writing a letter

    one evening as i was preparing dinner, my teenage son, allen, came to me and asked
    whether or not he should check "yes" to organ donation on his driver''s license.
    i was shocked and unprepared to address the subject, but he persisted, saying,
    "if i don''t need my organs, mom, and they can help someone else -- why not?"
    one year later, our beloved 17-year-old son suffered a traumatic brain injury
    in an automobile accident. as his father and i sat by his side, it became clear
    that allen''s life was to be no more. brokenhearted, we desperately searched for
    guidance to somehow extend his time with us. but allen had already given us the
    answer -- that evening discussion as i was preparing dinner. our son became a
    true hero the next day, when he donated the gift of a kidney/pancreas to a 29-year-old
    father of three boys. his left kidney, heart, liver, intestine and corneas went
    to other people in need of the "gift of life." allen''s love lives forever in
    our hearts, and his circle of life continues within the lives of those he saved.
    this summer, i will see firsthand the power of allen''s gift of life as i join
    his kidney/pancreas recipient and thousands of others at the olympic-style national
    kidney foundation u.s. transplant games, where he will celebrate and pay tribute
    to the gift of life. april is national donate life month. in the spirit of love,
    i am thankful for allen, the wonders of transplantation and the miracle of life.

    i served as a zoo docent for 15 years, giving tours and taking zoo animals into
    classrooms for lectures. when asked a tough question, we were taught to say, "i
    don''t know, but i will find out and get back to you with the answer." we would
    always take a name, phone number or address, and be sure that the question was
    answered correctly. one day, we actually heard a docent tell a class that an ostrich
    will "hide" by putting his/her head in the sand. (not true!) after that, we had
    a standing joke: a male ostrich was chasing a female ostrich, but she was doing
    a great job of staying just out of his reach. she abruptly turned a corner and
    stuck her head in the sand. the male turned the same corner, hot on her heels,

    a new co-worker seemed to be a nice person and potential friend when she was hired.
    however, after a few months, she began making comments to me or about me in front
    of others. sometimes they are good-natured, but more often they are insulting
    -- although presented as a "joke." i feel this is inappropriate, especially in
    the workplace. i have heard that this is a type of bullying where, if the victim
    objects, then the perpetrator belittles him or her as being "oversensitive," thus
    adding salt to the wound. i have noticed that people who play this little mind
    game on others can dish it out but can''t take it when someone retaliates. i''ve
    seen this happen in families where one sibling is scapegoated and picked on. i
    don''t want to waste energy playing games, but i don''t want to be a victim, either,
    so i have decided to ignore the comments and/or interrupt her by changing the
    subject or making an excuse to leave the room. have you any other suggestions?

    my girlfriend, "rita," and i have been together almost two years, and living together
    for about a year. we have decided to marry, but have not yet set a date. recently
    our marriage plans have run aground because i told her that i had made changes
    in my estate planning. i assigned rita as my 100 percent beneficiary for my savings/retirement
    benefits. she will also get 75 percent of my state retirement benefits; my sister
    will get the other 25 percent. in addition, i also had my $100,000 life insurance
    policy increased to $300,000. i allocated one-third of that for her, the rest
    to my parents. (until recently, she had not been assigned a percentage of anything.)
    rita is very upset that i did not make her my sole beneficiary. she says that
    "traditionally," a spouse leaves everything to the other spouse. she says that
    by assigning her less than 100 percent, i have not made her the no. 1 priority

    i''m a deputy sheriff. last week, i was in a department store outside my jurisdiction
    and overheard a conversation between two of the clerks. one of them had her car
    broken into the night before, and several valuable items and her house key had
    been stolen. this woman said she didn''t call the police because there was nothing
    they could do. i identified myself as a deputy and told her she should contact
    her police department immediately for the following reasons: (1) she was a victim
    of a crime. her house key was taken by someone who had already demonstrated that
    he or she was a criminal. if the perpetrator came back and robbed her house, or
    worse yet, harmed her, the police would have more to go on to solve that crime.
    (i also advised her to have her locks changed immediately.) (2) her car may not
    have been the only one broken into. if a pattern was developing, the police could
    increase patrols in her area. but they couldn''t know to do it if the incident
    went unreported. (3) in the course of serving search warrants or making other
    arrests, we often find property that obviously doesn''t belong to the suspect.
    (after all, who owns multiple tv sets, stereos, dvd players, digital cameras,
    etc.?) but if nobody reports a theft, we have no way of knowing whose property
    it is. without that knowledge, we can''t return property to its rightful owner,
    nor can we charge the suspect with additional crimes. (4) suspects often pawn
    what they steal. our detectives regularly check pawn shops for items that have
    been reported stolen and can recover them for the owner as well as pay a visit
    to whoever sold them. many crimes have been solved in this manner. please, abby,
    urge your readers to report all crimes of which they are victims. even if it appears
    the police are taking little action, they are, in fact, doing far more than is
    readily apparent. -- deputy peter n. spagnolo, payette, idaho'

    dollars. he has asked me to have it done, too. i told him i wasn''t interested
    and i thought it was too expensive. now he wants to have our 17-year-old son tested.
    i have argued that our son should not have his dna on record anywhere, that he
    really needs both parents to give consent for testing, and it costs too much.
    the horror i really have is that, 18 years ago, i made an awful mistake. i don''t
    know if my husband is the father of our son. i''m having panic attacks about his
    finding out how awful i was 18 years ago. can you issue advice that these dna
    tests should not be used on minor children, and that there are powerful reasons

    your response to "hurt and sad in trenton," whose wife slept with a married man

    reflecting back on years spent in ignorance turns happy marriages bitter, as one
    realizes one was played for a fool. suddenly the "innocent" nights out of old
    assume an ominous character. is it not better to risk a relationship at the beginning

    my wife and i have been married just short of one year and are expecting our first
    child in about four months. our marriage is a good one. we communicate well and
    love each other. there is one area, however, that continues to be problematic.
    i have been a youth basketball coach for three years. i was a coach before i met
    my wife and throughout our courtship. i have coached the same group of players,
    many of whose parents attribute their higher grades and better teamwork to their
    participation in the sport. my wife insists that i quit coaching these 11-year-olds
    once the baby arrives. practice takes me away from home two hours, one night a
    week, and the games are two hours once a week. i don''t think that''s a lot because
    i''m home all of the other "free time." i love my wife and the fact that we will
    be parents. i don''t think i''m asking too much when i tell her i''d like to continue
    coaching. i get a lot out of the experience and, honestly, i need some time to
    myself each week. am i unreasonable or selfish in expecting her to support my
    coaching? i love her and she loves me -- but i love coaching, too. i think it
    makes a huge difference in the lives of my team members. -- in foul trouble'

    this letter is in response to "sad in california," who is uncomfortable lying
    to her elderly mother, who has alzheimer''s, about the fact that her husband died.
    your answer was correct. i am a therapist. years ago, i was a consultant to nursing
    homes. once, i was called in to see a woman in the middle stages of alzheimer''s
    who had adjusted well to the nursing home. suddenly, however, she had become depressed
    and began having daily crying jags. i went in to speak to the woman, and the first
    thing she asked me was, "is my husband coming to see me today?" (her husband had
    been dead 20 years.) upon checking with staff, i found that in the past, staff
    working with her had always answered, "yes, i believe he will be in later." recently,
    however, a new supervisor had been hired who did not approve of lying, so she
    made staff start telling the woman each time she asked that her husband was dead.
    naturally, each time she heard it, she became upset, believing he had died just
    that day and she was hearing it for the first time. fortunately, the supervisor
    was open to suggestions, and everyone went back to saying the husband would be
    in "later." it made the woman happy each time she heard it, and she lived the
    rest of her days believing her husband was just running a little late. -- paula

    was a little surprised. i was tired from a hard day at work, so i went to bed

    was a freak, jumped out of bed, rushed into my bathroom, locked the door and got
    ready to leave for work. i didn''t see him before i left. should i call the wife

    after 23 years of what i thought was a happy marriage, i came home and caught
    my husband, "wes," in bed having sex with my brother. it was a shock, to say the
    least. that evening, they had gone to a bar and drank heavily. someone gave them
    a pill of unknown origin. wes says he doesn''t remember anything until i walked
    in and started slapping some sense into him. we have stayed together. we haven''t
    made love, however. i can''t seem to get the picture out of my head. i feel like
    my life has been shattered. i love wes and want us to have a productive life.

    regarding your reply to the "confused bride" who asked if she is obligated to
    invite her co-workers to her wedding if they gave her a wedding shower at the
    office, i disagree with your advice. you told her that if co-workers throw a bridal
    shower, "good manners" dictate they be invited to the wedding. abby, at my office
    we have many wedding showers, and almost all are impromptu affairs a week or two
    prior to the wedding. how could any bride invite the 20 or so people -- along
    with guests -- at such a late date? by then all of the final plans have been made.
    also, some of the showers at my company are quite large. not everyone who attends
    is a close friend of the bride (or groom). some attend just to sample the cake.

    confidential to my readers: as some of you may already know, march is national
    colorectal cancer awareness month. the american cancer society recommends that
    if you are 50 or older, it''s time to get tested for colon cancer. why? because
    testing saves lives. if you have a family history of colon cancer -- or other
    risk factors -- talk to your doctor about getting tested at an earlier age. the
    american cancer society offers a free information kit to help you talk to your
    doctor about colon cancer testing. call toll-free: (800) 227-2345, and let them

    my mother has eight grandchildren. four are mine; four are my sister''s. one,
    however, is her obvious favorite. she spares no expense when it comes to my sister''s
    oldest son, "johnny." she buys him extravagant gifts, praises him constantly,
    and hands him large sums of money in front of the other children -- often making
    a big deal out of presenting it to him. last christmas, she insisted that all
    the children come and sit around johnny as she presented him with a $100 bill.
    when we''re out together in public, she will say to perfect strangers, in front
    of all the children, "i love all my grandchildren, but i have special feelings
    for johnny. we have a special relationship that i don''t have with the others."
    my children are hurt by her actions and comments. when the children were younger,
    i could disguise her favoritism, but as my children have grown older, they are
    very aware of her feelings and actions. when my sister and i confronted mother
    about it, she cried, said she wouldn''t listen to such "hateful lies," then stormed
    from the room. is there a way to help my mother see what she''s doing to our family,
    or should i just protect my children from her abuse by staying away from her?

    i am the mother of two children ages 7 and 4. in a recent child development class,

    when i was 7 or 8, i was molested by a friend of the family -- but my real problem
    is my mother. after the incident, i had nightmares and wanted my mother to sleep
    with me. one morning i woke up and felt her touching me where i shouldn''t be
    touched. i didn''t know what to do, so i moved away from her. it happened three
    more times, until i finally asked her to stop sleeping with me. i am now 14, and
    about to become an aunt. i''m afraid of what my mother might do to the baby. i''m
    afraid to say anything because i don''t think anyone will believe me. (after the
    incidents i became distant to mother and we don''t get along.) what should i do
    about this, and what would make her do such a thing to her own daughter, knowing
    i was already trying to get over having been molested? -- scared in san diego'

    what should i have said to my new 24-year-old stepdaughter who started bawling
    when her father and i told her that we had eloped? she wasn''t crying out of happiness,
    or even disappointment that she hadn''t been invited. in fact, the first thing
    out of her mouth was to ask her father, "did you make her sign a pre-nup?" abby,
    i have never in my life felt so humiliated and offended by someone else''s rude
    behavior. if we hadn''t been out to dinner, i would have left immediately. she
    was sobbing uncontrollably at the table. but i held my head high and forced a
    smile for the rest of the meal. now i''m not really sure how i should act toward
    her. before her father and i married, i thought we had a very friendly relationship.
    i never imagined a reaction like the one she had. i feel it was rude, tacky, inappropriate
    and cruel. part of me never wants to see her again. any suggestions? -- crushed

    my son, "ian," has a girlfriend, "patty," who is 5 1/2 months pregnant. patty
    is bipolar, but she is not being treated for it and will not take medication.
    she has gotten mad at ian and literally beaten him up. the last time it happened,
    ian ended up with scratches on his face and a large bite on his upper arm. patty
    was arrested and had to spend four days in jail. in the meantime, her mother,
    "liz," came over to ian''s house and proceeded to tell me about patty''s life.
    before this all happened, patty told me she didn''t want me to meet liz because
    she was "crazy." while patty was in jail, liz told her that i had said patty needed
    to be institutionalized. what i did say was that patty needs to be analyzed. her
    mother also said that ian''s house has "bad spirits" in it. now patty refuses
    to move back home with my son. abby, this girl needs a lot of understanding and
    help, but how can i help her if she thinks i said all these bad things about her?

    i have a 3-year-old daughter who has been going to a home day-care provider since
    she was an infant. the sitter is wonderful and i like the way she cares for my
    daughter. she doesn''t speak english very well, but we have been able to communicate
    through her 12-year-old daughter, "laurie." the issue that i''m having is with
    her daughter. laurie plays with the children a lot when she gets out of school
    in the afternoons. lately, my daughter has been telling me that they play school
    and that laurie is the "teacher." my daughter comes home devastated every day
    because laurie tells her that she is getting failing grades and pretends to send
    her to the principal''s office. according to my daughter, none of the other kids
    have to do this. she also says that she has to eat her lunch alone for talking.
    i don''t think the sitter realizes that this is going on. i have tried to talk
    to laurie about it, but she denies doing it. i''m afraid this will have a lasting
    effect on my child when she starts school. i don''t want to change sitters, but

    on new year''s day, my stepdaughter and her husband dropped in unexpectedly. they
    live two miles away, and we see them frequently. after a very hectic christmas,
    i had been looking forward to a quiet, relaxing day with my husband. i had not
    even showered when they arrived. even though i was uncomfortable not having showered,
    and in my pajamas, i made our surprise guests welcome. i offered breakfast and
    coffee and spent hours with them. after 1 p.m., i finally decided to shower and
    dress. i made a fresh pot of coffee and offered our guests more to eat. i took
    between 45 minutes and an hour to shower and dress. when i emerged, i offered
    more coffee and food. they finally left hours later. a week later, my husband
    and i had a huge argument concerning how "rude" i was for having disappeared for

    i am married to a man who cheated on me for 30 years. first there was a long-distance
    romance with my high school girlfriend that lasted 28 years. then he had another
    affair with a woman from church. it went on for eight years that i know of. he
    always accused me of being "evil" because i expressed concern about his fidelity.
    of course, when i found solid evidence of his affairs, it was, "it''s over," and
    "it''ll never happen again," etc. but the affairs continued, and i didn''t leave.
    i don''t know why. perhaps it''s because i''m afraid of what''s out there. is

    where the line was drawn -- me on one side, all of them on the other. (i have
    no immediate family of my own, just a couple of close girlfriends i consider to
    be "family.") juan was caught in the middle. since then, we have come to an understanding
    regarding holidays, birthdays, etc. if i work the holiday, juan spends it with
    his family. if not, he''s home with me for the majority of it, but makes a short
    visit to them. (we live in the same town.) we split juan''s birthday. if someone
    from his family phones the house, i''m pleasant, but other than that we don''t

    cannot stay home alone. they still need supervision. the reason i am going back
    to work is because we need the money. my husband was laid off after 30 years working
    at one company. however, he cannot take early retirement because he is still too
    young. should i mention to the kids that we are heading for financial trouble,
    so that''s why they have to go to day care? please reply asap. my husband has
    found a job, but we need the extra income. -- faithful reader in texas'

    i have a dilemma. i have known the man of my dreams, "gabe," for 14 years. we
    have been in a serious committed relationship for more than two of them. gabe
    has said he wants to marry me, and even went so far as to look at engagement rings
    and ask my input as to what my dream wedding would be like. we found a location,
    the ring, and even set a date. but now gabe says he doesn''t need a license to
    make him feel like he is married to me. i''m ready to leave because i want to
    be a wife and have children. should i wait for something that may never happen,

    she meets may not be mr. right, but he may have a friend who could be. has she

    i''m a 30-something male in the same situation. i remember a former psychology
    professor giving us a lecture that addressed this issue. he said people are often
    lonely not because nobody loves them, but because they don''t love or recognize
    the ones who do. he gave an example of a woman who complained that she was lonely
    and without prospects. her mentor said, "what about jim, the checker at the grocery
    store? he wants to date you." she dismissed it with, "... but he works in a grocery
    store." i''m a college-educated professional, also unattached and sometimes lonely.

    successful single women with high iqs might scrutinize their criteria for "mr.
    right." must he have a "certain income," perfect looks, the right connections?
    can he have children, a limp, a bald head, be poorer than she is? are they looking
    for love without judgment, as they would wish to be evaluated? regardless of their
    achieved status, they must realize that what''s on the inside means more. do they
    wear contacts, makeup, padded bra, color their hair? they do? life isn''t "sex

    table to join the other single women, and my daughter-in-law (not the mother of
    the bride) motioned to me to come to her table. she was frowning and shaking her
    head "no." i went over, and she told me in a scolding tone that it was "inappropriate"
    for me to join the younger women because i was actually considered a widow and
    not "single." she also told me that catching the bouquet was intended for people
    who had never been married, not people like me. abby, i am 65, young at heart,

    my 81-year-old mother died suddenly, and as her oldest daughter, i was asked to
    give her eulogy. i was told by our church that i needed to submit my remarks to
    the priest beforehand, to make sure they were "appropriate." at the funeral mass,
    when the priest, who knew my mother only by sight, began his homily, he used the
    exact words and phrases from my own eulogy. i was, naturally, taken aback at his
    using my own heartfelt words, which i had labored over and rehearsed for two days.
    when it was time to speak, i was able to recover enough to reference "father''s"
    remarks earlier -- but it was extremely upsetting to suddenly hear my words coming
    out of his mouth. i could understand if he had wanted to coordinate his remarks
    with mine, but he outright stole them. i feel that by requiring me to submit my
    eulogy in advance, the priest was provided with the "cliffsnotes" he needed to
    do his homily. i was also upset that he did not counsel my family, attend her
    wake or the interment. when i returned to the funeral home to pick up the photographs
    of my mother, i discussed my feelings of profound disappointment with the funeral
    director. he told me it wasn''t the first time he''d heard this complaint about
    this priest, and i should write the priest a letter. on one hand, i feel my mother
    would be upset if i create a conflict with the parish. on the other, i wonder
