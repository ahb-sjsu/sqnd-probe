    my friend "russ" is a sweet, quiet, reserved guy with a goofy side. he''s in his
    mid-20s, but has never kissed a girl or gone out on a date. (he is the kind of
    person girls regard as a brother figure.) he has no confidence and doesn''t drink,
    dance or let loose. i have seen his dating profiles, and they are brutally unappealing.
    i want to help russ find someone before it''s too late. i hate seeing him lonely.
    he needs someone to give him a chance and help him learn to be more confident.

    was young, so i have a fear of being a single mom. kirk grew up never knowing

    be left alone, he gets frustrated. i''m wondering if this is an example of how

    he says it would be different because it would involve a child, not a pet. i love

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    a family member keeps setting up fundraisers every time she wants to buy something
    for her family. if a child needs a special class, she asks the relatives to pitch
    in to pay for it. when her husband wanted to return to college, she brought all
    the extended family together to see who could contribute. she has now set up a
    fundraiser for family and friends to raise $6,000 to send her teenaged daughter
    to an expensive performing arts camp. i think this is extravagant. if they can''t
    afford it, they should select a camp they can afford or have the 16-year-old go
    out and earn the money. i also think they should be saving for college rather
    than camp. this woman''s father was a preacher, and sometimes i think she never
    got the message that fundraising is usually for charity, not for individuals who
    happen to need some cash. am i wrong to be embarrassed by what she''s doing, or
    is this a new normal? -- embarrassed in texas'

    i''m retired and have the time to sew and quilt projects, which i give as gifts.
    i presented a "quilt of valor" to my father to honor his military service. i also
    gave a sibling one of my personalized projects as a birthday gift. abby, when
    we visited their home recently, i was horrified to see one of their dogs sleeping
    on one of the pillows i had made for them. when the dog woke up, it proceeded
    to scratch itself and then drag the hair-covered pillow through the house. i have
    been asked to make a quilt for a disabled child living at home who also has a
    dog that sleeps on her bed. i no longer want to invest my time and energy after
    what happened to my gift. i feel unappreciated. would it be wrong to refuse the
    request and say something about "gift abuse"? -- sew perplexed in the northwest'

    my husband and i have been together for 21 years. i''m extremely social, while
    he is not. for the past six to 10 years he has become increasingly resistant to
    going out in public places, especially when it involves getting together with
    my family or friends. during last year''s holidays, i pleaded yet another "sudden
    illness" on his behalf. i feel he makes himself ill with anxiety so he can bow
    out at the last minute. when i cancel plans we''ve made -- which is often -- he
    generally "feels better" after we cancel. it''s frustrating. while i am sympathetic,

    i am a straight man who met and fell in love with a transgender girl i''ll call
    eve. we dated for almost three years, and they were the happiest of my life. in
    all that time, we never once had an argument. she said i had given her the strength
    to come out to her family and begin her transition. i was planning to ask her
    to marry me. without any indication that anything was wrong, she dumped me one
    day and weeks later began dating her friend, another trans girl. i wanted to walk
    away and take time to heal, but eve maintained that i was important to her and
    we could remain friends. for the next few months we tried, but her new girlfriend
    treated me like i was a threat. while i was emotionally hurting, she seemed to
    take intense pleasure in showing me how happy they were together. it eventually
    led to friction, and now my ex thinks i caused it because i was jealous, so she
    cut off all contact with me. i stood by her when she absolutely needed my support,
    but when the time came to give a little back, i was abandoned. i''m worried i
    will never trust anyone again, and i don''t know how to get "myself" back. can

    i am a 23-year-old woman who recently got out of a six-year abusive relationship.
    while i was in the relationship, no one knew what was going on. when i finally
    left him, i started dating a man of a different race. people are now saying i
    moved too fast because we got together a month after i moved out. but we had been
    close friends for more than a year before things started to kick off. the issue
    is, my family disapproves of our relationship because of his race and because
    they believe he didn''t give me enough time to figure out what i wanted. i feel
    like i already knew what i wanted. i had been emotionally done with my first relationship
    for a good six months. my family refuses to meet him, nor do they want to hear
    anything about our relationship. my family and i had always been close -- until

    my niece has a 1-year-old son. neither my niece nor the baby''s father is religious,

    to organize an informal baptism -- just holy water and a couple of prayers? we

    over the years, we have helped out our daughters as much as we could. one daughter,
    "doreen," has needed more help than the others. she has four children who are
    near and dear to our hearts. they have been living with us the better part of
    their lives. doreen married a guy who is the father of three of the children.
    (i''ll call him john.) he''s in trouble with the law constantly and can''t hold
    a job. after we moved them all in with us, john decided he wanted to move back
    home to his family, so he packed up everyone and left. we told doreen we could
    no longer support them financially, and that if they wanted to move away, they
    would assume that responsibility. now she''s writing us saying they can''t pay
    the rent and their electricity is being shut off. she wants us to "loan" them
    money. we refused. now we can no longer talk to, text, write, skype or communicate
    in any way with our grandchildren. the sil says we lost that privilege. my wife
