    i am a widow in my late 60s, attractive and youthful looking (i''m told). for
    the past three years, i have been going out with a nice man my age, "dell." i
    have him over for home-cooked meals, and i occasionally pay for our dinners and
    movies out. dell is also my guest for dinners at my club, and of course i pay
    the club dues. sometimes i pick him up in my car for our dates and day trips.
    he can well afford to take me out and pick up the check, but he always says, "let''s
    keep it even." i am becoming more and more uncomfortable when we''re having dinner
    out, because i resent being expected to split the cost of everything. dell is
    an educated, interesting man. i find myself wondering if i''m out of step with
    the times -- or if he''s cheap. abby, i feel used. i''m beginning to lose respect
    for dell. i''m from the old school: if a man asks a lady out, he pays. what''s
    your opinion? should i tell him i''m tired of nit-picking expenses and stop paying
    for half of everything? -- frustrated in the lone star state'

    a long time ago i promised myself i would wait until i found the right girl before
    having sex. the "right girl" for me is one who will love me as much as i love
    her, is easy to talk to, shares similar interests and has respect for herself.
    as i get older, i''m finding out that not many girls fill those requirements.
    i don''t date much because every girl i think about going out with, i come to
    find out has slept with a bunch of guys. it upsets me that in today''s world,
    sex is no longer viewed as something to be shared between two people in love,
    but as something that just goes along with casual relationships. when i look at
    the relationships of my friends, i find they are not happy. most of them don''t
    trust their partners -- and for good reason. after the first few dates, if i make
    no moves beyond some heavy kissing, the relationship seems to grow distant. i
    am now 23 and worried i won''t ever find the right girl for me. are my expectations
    too high? -- losing hope in sardis, ohio'

    this is in response to "at the end of my rope," whose 76-year-old grandmother
    ignores advice about her health. first, i would recommend that she call grandma''s
    primary care physician to make sure he or she is aware of the family''s concerns
    and of all her medications. second, one of the children should go with her on
    the next medical visit to hear what the doctor has to say. (having another set
    of ears at a doctor''s visit is a real benefit.) third, is there a specialist
    in geriatrics in the area? perhaps grandma needs an evaluation to see if there
    is something else wrong or if the medicines are interacting in a negative way.
    fourth, there are medication boxes available to help people manage their dosage.
    fifth, all of her medications should be written down and posted on the refrigerator
    with the times they are to be taken. changing a person''s eating habits may be
    difficult, but medicine is a different story. many people go to a number of doctors
    and do not tell each doctor what they are taking. drug interaction can be a real
    problem. also, the grandchild should talk to a counselor to reduce her feelings
    of guilt. -- been there and done that in illinois'

    i am a 62-year-old widow. my husband died two years ago. we were married 40 wonderful
    years. determined not to fall into depression, i arranged my finances so that
    my future is secure. if anything should happen to me, my four sons will not be
    unduly burdened. during my late husband''s long hospitalization, a friend of more
    than 27 years, "norman," made it his mission to keep my spirits up. four months
    after the funeral, he insisted i get out of the house and go with him to the movies,
    the beach, for a drive, etc. i have always been comfortable with norm. he is caring,
    concerned, affectionate and active in our church and community. this past year,
    we have gone on trips together, and he never fails to make me laugh. norm is financially
    secure, and we have no plans to live together or marry. i''ve made that clear
    to my sons. however, they are very upset that i''m seeing him! they have informed
    me that they are not comfortable with including norman in holiday and family affairs
    or vacations we take together. they have known this man since they were kids,
    and he has done nothing to account for their attitude. norm''s children have no
    such qualms and have extended me an open invitation to their homes. i have never
    made any of my sons'' friends, girlfriends, lovers or wives unwelcome in my home
    -- whether i liked them or not. my sons'' "significant others" were always included
    on vacations. more and more, i am angry that norm is not welcome at family gatherings.
    i don''t want to cause a scene or estrange my children, but i will not exclude
    someone i care about. what should i do, abby? christmas is just around the corner,

    a moment and reflect upon all of the blessings for which to be thankful? as part
    of the celebration, i''m repeating the traditional thanksgiving column, first
    written by my mother. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve
    lived this long. a lot of people have not been so fortunate. you''re hurting?
    thousands -- maybe millions -- are hurting even more. (have you ever volunteered
    at a nursing home? homeless shelter? a rehabilitation clinic for adults or children?)
    if you awakened this morning able to hear the birds sing, use your vocal cords
    to speak, walk to the breakfast table on two good legs, and read the newspaper
    with two good eyes -- praise the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your
    pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world is a lot poorer. in fact, one-third
    of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are you lonely? then
    remember the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, pick up the
    phone and call someone. are you concerned about our country''s future? hooray!
    our political system has been saved by such concern. in this great country of
    ours, you can worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret ballot, and
    you can even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head or
    a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different political
    system, you are free to go. there are no walls or fences -- nothing to keep you
    here. a final thought: want an instant high? the surest way to beat the holiday
    blues is to do something nice for someone else. why not call a person who lives
    alone and invite him or her to dinner? better yet, call and say, "i''m coming
    to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." (some older people don''t drive,
    and those who do may not like to be behind the wheel after dark.) try it. and
    please let me know the results. and now, i''ll repeat the thanksgiving prayer
    that was penned by my mother years ago. my thanksgiving would not be complete
    without it: oh, heavenly father, we thank thee for food and remember the hungry.
    we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank thee for friends and
    remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember the enslaved.
    may these remembrances stir us to service, that thy gifts to us may be used for
    others. amen. -- love, abby p.s. we have much to be grateful for on this thanksgiving
    day. for those of you with a little time to spare -- how about showing our gratitude
    to veterans by visiting a veterans hospital and raising the spirits of those who
    have served our country in years past? happy thanksgiving, everyone!'

    i am a 38-year-old woman facing a tough dilemma. my parents divorced when i was
    7. my father was a drunk and a wife beater and refused to pay the $5 a week that
    mom asked for the four of us. he spread nasty rumors around town, which caused
    my mother untold stress. he brought his drunken friends into our bathroom when
    i was in the tub with no shower curtain. he would drag me out of bed in the middle
    of the night and make me take off my nightgown while he whipped me with a belt.
    i do not hate the man -- i have no feelings for him at all. the problem is my
    aunt -- his sister -- who always remembered each of our birthdays with a $20 bill.
    we lived far below poverty level with no welfare because mom didn''t want us to
    grow up expecting a handout. last week my aunt sent me a birthday card and asked
    me to do her a personal favor by sending my father the get-well card she had enclosed,
    as he just had surgery for cancer. she said it would mean the world to him and
    to her. i love my aunt -- she''s recovering from cancer, too. she has never asked
    me for anything, but her request is very hard for me. my aunt has always thought
    her brother was the victim of my "mean" mother -- who, by the way, raised three
    good kids who never tried drugs, have high morals and strong work ethics. in her
    letter, my aunt said that someday i would find out my parents'' "whole story --
    the true one." abby, i know the true one. i lived it! should i write to my aunt
    and tell her the "true story" of her abusive brother? or should i grant her wish
    and send a get-well card to my father -- the wife beater and child abuser? please
    help. -- losing sleep in new hampshire'

    my 19-year-old son just lost his best friend to suicide. he is deeply hurt and
    torn over this, and i don''t know what i can do to help him. he has been getting
    drunk ever since it happened. i went to the funeral with my son, but he didn''t
    want to sit with me. he sat with his friends. after the service, he rode with
    them to the cemetery, but they somehow got lost in traffic and arrived too late
    for the burial. i know that''s what is hurting him most right now, since he was
    asked to be a pallbearer and didn''t get to do the last thing he could do for
    his best buddy. all this took place on friday; i have not seen my son until now.
    it is early sunday morning; he just came home drunk and crying. he went straight
    to bed, and i could hear him crying himself to sleep. when i ask him if he''s
    ok, he says yes -- but i know he''s not. i''m afraid he is going to get worse,
    because he''s taking this so hard. the boys were as close as brothers. in fact,
    he was closer to his friend than his own brother. my heart is breaking for my

    my live-in boyfriend constantly gives me hickeys. despite the fact that i have
    asked him not to, he intentionally marks my neck and throat on a weekly basis.
    i am in my mid-20s and find these bright-red marks both unprofessional and unnecessary.
    i have also tried wearing perfume or moisturizer on my neck to get him to stop.
    how do i prevent the hickeys, or do i have to get rid of the boyfriend? -- embarrassed

    prior to my older sister''s recent death, she shared a family secret. she told
    me that in the 1960s, while he was serving in the u.s. military in a foreign country,
    our brother had fathered a child. he was young and fresh out of high school. my
    sister said our now-deceased mother had opened a letter addressed to my brother
    from the baby''s mother saying his child was born. she read it -- and tore it
    up. to my sister''s knowledge, mother never shared the news with my brother. now

    in the year 2000, i graduated from law school. since then i have been unable to
    pass the state bar exam, which is offered only twice a year. it''s a tough exam
    for someone like me who has never tested well. i have tried four times. the last
    time i was only 24 points away from passing. last month i was laid off from my
    job, and my husband has been supporting me and our two sons, 4 and 2. my husband
    is wonderful in that he not only supports me, but also encourages me to study
    harder and try once again to pass the bar. he knows that if i pass, i could one
    day double our current income. i would be happy as an attorney, yet i think i
    could also find happiness in any job where i can help people. with the education
    i already have, i might be able to obtain a state or federal job, so i''m wondering
    if i should continue trying to pass the bar. do you think i should move on with
    my life and find another job, so i can begin repaying my student loans and not
    feel so guilty all the time? abby, looking back, i don''t know if my four years

    may i suggest another way for "worried bride-to-be" to look at her "disability"?
    in the early 1900s, the new york giants baseball team had a pitcher named luther
    h. taylor. he was a deaf mute who was, in an era of insensitivity, nicknamed "dummy."
    taylor lost a lot of games due to his inability to communicate with his teammates.
    john mcgraw, the manager of the giants, was under enormous pressure from the team''s
    owner, the fans and the sportswriters to trade taylor. instead, mcgraw required
    the entire giant team to learn american sign language. once that was accomplished,
    mcgraw used hand signals to lead his team. that''s the origin of the hand signals
    that are used in baseball today. rather than be embarrassed about her disability,
    "worried" should find a way to use her special abilities. -- stephen redmond,

    i have a 16-year-old son, "jordy." he has a lot of guy friends who occasionally
    sleep over on weekends, listening to cds and playing on the computer. they are
    all good kids. they talk to me and are respectful of the house. a few weeks ago,
    on a saturday night at about 11 p.m., jordy and three other guys were in the driveway
    playing basketball. a neighbor called the police to complain about the noise.
    two officers showed up and spoke to the boys. the kids were quick to apologize.
    the police never spoke to me -- i was in the house with the door open, but was
    unaware of the incident. i was angry that a neighbor would call the police before
    talking to me or the boys first. eventually, i found out which neighbor made the
    call; i confronted him. now he''s put out with me for "making a big deal" out
    of the fact that the cops were called. jordy and his friends never meant to cause
    trouble. they were having fun and got carried away with their laughter. the arrival
    of the squad car embarrassed them. frankly, i''m glad i can provide a safe place
    for them to hang out, so they''re not wandering around town being bored. i wish
    neighbors would be just that -- neighbors. i thought we were supposed to look
    out for each other. i''m trying to let this go, but i won''t be satisfied until
    that neighbor apologizes to jordy and his friends. am i right, abby? -- pitman,

    fire prevention month has nearly ended, but may i still enlist your help? firefighters
    across the country are so eager to respond to emergency calls, they frequently
    fail to buckle their own seat belts. last year, 13 firefighters died from injuries
    that could have been prevented simply by buckling their seat belts. while many
    fire departments have rules that are strictly enforced, the majority do not enforce
    the seat belt rule until someone gets hurt or killed. six firefighters this year
    have died from rollovers or being thrown from fire and personal vehicles while
    responding to a fire. excuses from firefighters range from, "we need to put on
    our gear," to "seat belts don''t fit over the gear." it is the responsibility
    of each individual to buckle his or her seat belt. i''d like to ask each spouse,
    parent, child, family member or friend of a firefighter to please remind him or
    her to buckle up whether riding in a fire truck or ambulance. listen up, firefighters:
    seatbelts are for everyone ... even firefighters! not buckling up is just plain

    my husband, "george," and i have been married 36 years. during that time i have

    he''d had a crush on in high school. (i''ll call her kate.) kate said she wondered
    what had happened to some of their old classmates, so george suggested they attend
    their 40th class reunion together. i didn''t care to go, so i agreed it might
    be fun for them to see the old gang. since then, the three of us have enjoyed
    dinners and movies. they''re now planning a seven-day caribbean cruise together
    and say they want to share a room to save money. i was invited, but i don''t plan
    to go. george insists there is no sexual attraction -- but i''m becoming uncomfortable
    and annoyed with the situation. the chosen few to whom he''s confided his vacation
    plans say i''m crazy for allowing things to escalate this far. i''m beginning
    to agree. my husband recently had a heart attack and takes numerous medications.
    i have stuck by his side all these years while he was in and out of the hospital
    with various ailments. i don''t understand why he now wants to spend so much time

    elderly, sick mother who didn''t protect her, in order to exorcize what she should
    have resolved for herself, with psychiatric aid if necessary. better for her to
    have said to her mother, "i love you," than rehash her childhood sexual abuse.
    what do you know about what a woman has to do to maintain support for five children,
    and then, to justify her errors to herself? (and live with them.) furthermore,
    do you have any assurance that harpooning the sick, elderly mother with the writer''s

    some aunts, uncles and cousins live near me in east texas. my girlfriend, "cyndi,"
    and i have been dating for three years. she recently decided to move to san antonio
    to be closer to her parents -- and to "find herself." cyndi has met my parents
    several times and told me she intended to learn spanish so she could better communicate
    with them. (they speak little english.) i was delighted because when we visit
    my family in mexico, cyndi would not feel left out of our conversations. cyndi
    and i spoke over the weekend. she told me she had signed up for language classes.
    when i called her last night, she informed me that she''s taking german. then
    she gave me a lecture about how my family needs to learn english because they
    live in america. (they try hard.) then i asked her how she intends to communicate
    with my family in mexico. she ignored the question. abby, cyndi and i have split
    up several times over the past three years. we always seem to find something to
    argue about. now this. what do you think about this, and what should i do? --

    i am a 20-year-old college student. i have been dating a wonderful man i''ll call
    cyrus for two years. he is sweet, good to me, and i am deeply in love with him.

    lives with his mother and stepfather and receives a monthly disability check from
    the state. when i tell people about my relationship with cyrus, the first thing

    she''d give him money. i will never forgive nick for what he has done. a few weeks

    has stopped using crack, he still shoplifts and yells at my mom until she gives
    him money. i really can''t say anything, because whenever i make a suggestion,
    he yells at me and hurts my mom more. i have an urge to kill him. i''d have called

    in touch by e-mail. (this has always been initiated by her.) it has become a problem,

    she wrote to ask phil how my pregnancy was coming along. our daughter was born
    two months ago, and yesterday we were informed that madison bought a baby gift

    i''m a 40-something flight attendant. my husband and i spent a lot of money to
    have his vasectomy reversed so we could have another baby. it failed. i began
    artificial insemination. after i mentioned the situation to one of my co-workers,
    she said she knew that a handsome young pilot we fly with had donated his sperm
    at the same clinic i used. happily, i am now pregnant. i suspect my girlfriend
    told the pilot because he now goes out of his way to avoid me. i can''t be sure,
    but the pilot matches the description in the clinic''s donor catalog of the specimen

    my husband and i have been married for 32 years. his mother, "lois," usually comes
    to visit for a few days once a year, but this time she wants to stay for a month.
    my husband works from home and deals with numerous clients. we are also a foster
    family who takes in medically fragile children. their care and medical appointments
    keep me very busy, plus i have them involved in community programs. our household
    presently consists of an 11-year-old foster son and an 11-year-old with special
    needs whom we adopted. our adult son also lives with us. during previous visits
    when lois has been with us for as long as a month, she literally cries and whines
    when my husband and i can''t spend what she thinks is enough time with her. we
    do try to do special things as a family and, of course, make an effort to involve
    lois. she does nothing but complain. when we got pricey third-row seats to the
    musical "beauty and the beast," her complaint was that the seats were not in the
    center. last christmas she stayed for a month, even though we asked her not to.
    one night my husband and i got a sitter so we could go out for dinner. we needed
    some time alone. when we got home, lois was furious. my husband tried to explain
    that married people need a little time to themselves once in a while, and we meant
    her no disrespect. well, yesterday on the phone she rehashed the whole thing again.

    i met a wonderful man, "ryan," whom i love dearly. we were planning on a june
    wedding, but i called it off because of his heavy credit card debt. i thought
    it should be paid off before we got married. also, ryan has a way of hiding things
    from me that i feel should be out in the open. if he gets a call from a bill collector,
    he always goes into another room to talk. shouldn''t i be included in what''s
    going on in his life? i would offer to help with his debt, but ryan makes three
    times as much money as i do. plus, i have discovered that some of his credit card
    charges are from internet porn sites. (he swears he no longer frequents them.)
    don''t get me wrong, abby. this man has done everything he can to get back on
    track financially so we can be married. but i still feel he''s hiding little things
    from me -- mostly about money. am i making too much of this? what should i do
    or say when he talks about setting another wedding date? i''m not shy about speaking
    up and sharing my feelings, but somehow he isn''t willing to open up and come
    clean with me. your advice would be greatly appreciated. -- wary fiancee in tennessee'

    three weeks ago, a dear friend, "mary," died, only four days after being diagnosed
    with lung cancer. i spent those four days in the hospital with her, sleeping in
    a chair by her bed at night. her husband, "jim," was also by her side. he held
    her hand and spoke to her even though she could no longer speak due to the morphine
    that was controlling her pain. the time we spent at the hospital was only the
    second time i had met him. we talked for hours while we sat in mary''s room. i
    thought jim was a very sweet man. last week, jim said he wanted to see me. i didn''t
    think much about it because i had helped him with some insurance documents. when
    we met, i was surprised when he expressed a desire to spend time with me. abby,
    i''m not sure jim should be dating anyone at this time. i think he may be lonely.

    at age 15 by two policemen during world war ii. she is still haunted by that tragedy.

    was gone, my stepfather raped me. he said if i told he would hurt my two little
    sisters. every night i feared the rape would happen again. after my sisters were
    asleep, i would crawl under my bed and scoot back as far as i could. then i''d
    watch the crack under the bedroom door to see if my stepfather was approaching.
    i never told my mother what happened. one night, my stepfather got drunk and told
    my mother he and i had sex. she came to me and hit me hard. she said, "how dare
    you try to take my husband!" i ran away that night. i was 15. i didn''t see my
    mother for many years. i moved to another state. forty years later, my elderly
    mother and i are talking, but not one word has been said about the rape. how can

    missed: "lately, i''ve been telling her i''m out of whatever she asks for, but
    she''s always quick to ask for something else." is it possible that the neighbor
    might be needing a friend? sometimes reaching out and asking for something is
    an attempt at conversation and friendship. a shy person might think this is an
    effective way of communicating. what if the writer were to walk over and ask to
    borrow something herself? i''d be interested to see if the neighbor invites her
    in. if so, maybe that''s the type of hospitality she''s looking for. abby, i think
    your advice was excellent for a pesky neighbor, but what if the person is someone
    who wasn''t blessed with the social skills that you and i were -- and is only
    trying to make a friend? -- marisa in san luis obispo, calif.'

    did it occur to you that the "freeloader" could be one of the millions of one-check-away-from-the-street
    poor? i grew up incredibly poor, and if it hadn''t been for the kindness of our
    neighbors, i wouldn''t have made it. one neighbor became a father figure to my
    siblings and me -- in addition to giving us milk. i urge people not to turn their
    backs on their neighbors. the poor, the sick and the lonely need our support.
    what kind of a world would it be if we ignored those next door to us? community
    is not just for the well-off. perhaps the writer of that letter should find out
    why her neighbor has no phone or anything else. maybe she could help her. -- thankful

    last summer, before we were married, my fiance, "justin," and i had a conversation
    that led to him telling me that he thought my mother was prettier and more sexually
    attractive than i am. i was devastated. i am the spitting image of my mother.
    he later apologized for what he said and we moved on. however, it took me months
    to regain my self-esteem to a point where i could even look at myself in the mirror.
    justin has always been the type to prefer older women. in fact, he has dated several.
    (he is 6 1/2 years older than i am.) i cannot help but feel he would rather be
    with my mom. it doesn''t help matters that my mother is the biggest flirt i know.
    she flirts constantly with justin, and when i confront her about it, she tells
    me i am "overreacting." even now, after more than a year, i still get bouts of
    depression that leave me feeling worthless. although i know he loves me, i feel
    he will never look at me and see someone as sexy and beautiful as my mother. what

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    how can people observe the first anniversary of sept. 11 in a personal way with
    family and friends? this question has been posed to the white house commission
    on remembrance by teenagers and seniors alike. in response, we have developed
    a special remembrance, centered on the theme "stand with courage." real courage
    is born of necessity in a crisis, exemplified by the actions displayed by the
    passengers on the fateful united airlines flight 93, or the men and women who
    ran up the stairs of the collapsing buildings in the call of duty. it is reflected
    in the bravery of the wives, husbands and children who have continued with their
    lives after the devastating loss of their loved ones. every one of us can observe
    the anniversary of the attacks by pausing for a personal moment of remembrance,
    which includes the symbolic ringing of a bell three times (once for each site)
    and an informal candlelight vigil. suggestions for such a remembrance are available
    on the commission''s web site at www.remember.gov. these ideas include gathering
    with loved ones for dinner, saying a prayer for the families of those who died,
    driving with headlights illuminated or displaying the american flag. "you gain
    strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop
    to look fear in the face," eleanor roosevelt once said. "you are able to say to
    yourself, ''i have lived through this horror. i can take the next thing that comes
    along.''" we can continue to affirm our strength as a nation by renewing our faith
    and courage on this first anniversary of the attacks. -- carmella la spada, executive

    my widowed grandmother was recently murdered in a home invasion. my father (her
    son) wanted my family and me (my children are 5 and 9) to come immediately. i
    wanted to leave the kids at home because we live in another state and it''s a
    six-hour drive. dad insisted their presence would be helpful. we made the decision
    not to take the children with us. when we were en route, we discovered that the
    family was gathering at my grandmother''s home -- where she had been murdered.
    when my parents found out that we hadn''t brought the kids, they became very angry
    with me and have not spoken to me since the memorial service. was i wrong not
    to take the kids to grandma''s home for what became a three-day gathering before
    the funeral? i confess it upset me considerably when i arrived at my grandmother''s
    home two days after the tragedy and saw the bullet holes, the closed door to her
    bedroom where she was murdered, and heard the constant discussion about the police
    investigation. however, if you think i should, i will beg for my parents'' forgiveness.

    after a breakfast discussion about the obesity crisis in our nation, i saw the
    letter from "worried in rhode island," the 14-year-old girl who is concerned about
    her friends who use alcohol and drugs. i''ve been thinking a lot lately about
    health and self-destructiveness. i see this as one of the major problems in our
    nation today. all over the country, flags are hanging in front of thousands of
    homes signifying that we are united against the common enemy of terrorism. but
    i can''t help remembering that profound line from the comic strip, "pogo": "we
    have met the enemy, and it is us." as we descend further and further down the
    slippery slope of addictions (which include not only alcohol, drugs and cigarettes,
    but shopping, gambling, overeating, sexual obsessions, and more), we are becoming
    a nation so harmful to itself that terrorists need only sit back and watch us
    self-destruct. how can we be truly strong and healthy as a nation when we are
    comprised of individuals who are not strong and healthy? what can be done to institute
    a national campaign to strengthen ourselves as individuals with physical and emotional
    health? of course, for younger people, we must use the public schools, but factual
    drug education and testimonials about harmful consequences have never been enough.
    we must discover why we hurt ourselves in these ways. seeking health and strength
    should be not only our personal goals, but would enable us to unify and defend
    against terrorists in a way that would do more good than simply waving the flag.

    when i was young, i was extremely shy. i finally got over it, and here''s how:
    i came to the realization that shy people have one thing in common -- they''re
    all overly sensitive about how others perceive them. "am i dressed right? does
    my hair look ok?" they obsess about themselves. then one day someone asked me
    about a necklace i was wearing -- and that one question distracted me so i didn''t
    think about myself. after that, i made an effort to find something of interest
    to ask other shy people about, and it would usually open up a conversation. conquering
    my shyness didn''t happen overnight, but i was eventually able to go into sales
    and even make "cold calls." i''ve come a long way from the shy girl i was as a

    i am 17. last spring my boyfriend''s brother got married. i attended the wedding
    and reception. i was also invited to the family home the next day for the bride
    and groom''s gift-opening ceremony. my boyfriend and i gave them pretty candlesticks
    for their apartment. my mother, who was not invited to the wedding or reception,
    thought it would be nice to give them a token gift, so she gave them a lovely
    wedding card with $20 enclosed. as they opened their gifts and cards, they disclosed
    the amount of money on each check they received, and made comments about each
    one in front of everybody in the room. the bride is from a wealthy family. some
    checks were for more than $500. when they got to my mom''s card, instead of just
    saying a simple, "thank you," they announced the $20 amount and said, "well, i
    guess that''s appropriate!" abby, i was appalled and furious. my mother didn''t
    have to give them a thing. i was so upset, i left the party. is this kind of behavior
    acceptable? it''s been bugging me after all this time. what do you think? -- still
    bugged in illinois'

    it was the fall of 1968, and i was a young, newly hired cabin attendant for the
    now defunct transworld airlines. on one memorable flight, i had the pleasure of
    attending to mr. robinson in the first-class cabin. he was a warm and friendly
    man -- and completely unassuming. a friend of mine who idolized him was going
    to pick me up when we landed in new york. i asked mr. robinson if he would mind
    signing an autograph for my friend, and he came back with, "better yet -- let''s
    really surprise him!" edward g. and i walked arm-in-arm off the plane and strode
    up to my friend, who was standing there absolutely speechless with his mouth open.
    mr. robinson greeted him by tipping his hat and saying, "how do you do? i am edward
    g. robinson." for having played some "heavies" on screen, he truly was a gentle

    your advice to "protective new dad" should have been more strongly worded. if
    he''s uncomfortable about grandma''s driving, it''s not just his own child he
    should worry about -- it''s everyone else''s, too. that''s the approach i took
    with both my mother and grandmother when it became obvious their reflexes weren''t
    what they once were. first, i persuaded them to admit they were "a bit slower."
    then i said: "you love children, and there are lots of them in this neighborhood.
    could you ever forgive yourself if a child darted into the street, and there was
    a tragedy because you couldn''t slam on the brakes fast enough?" they each handed
    over their car keys. it wasn''t fun for any of us, but it may have saved lives.

    a longtime family friend''s son is being married at the end of the month. our
    families were extremely close and the boys have been best friends for years. i
    say "were" close because about six years ago, i was terribly despondent and attempted
    suicide. after that, these close family friends would have nothing to do with
    me. we had gone everywhere together and they were my son''s godparents. i can''t
    begin to tell you how traumatic the loss of this friendship has been. we run into
    each other occasionally, and she is always friendly toward me, but that is where
    it ends. her son still stops by to see me and we get along well. today my son
    received an invitation to the wedding addressed only to him. he is 25 years old
    and has his own apartment. he called to tell me the date and told me to mark it
    on my calendar. i said, "i''ll check my invitation when it arrives." he replied,
    "you won''t be getting one." abby, am i supposed to be his guest? i don''t know
    how to take this. i feel very hurt and slighted that i wasn''t sent my own invitation.

    water came from a coal-fired stove in the kitchen. while the girls and i (the
    youngest boy) slept three or four to a bed, our five older brothers slept on the
    floor of the unfinished attic. after two more boys came to live with us -- a cousin
    and a friend whose mother had died -- my mother''s friends would ask, "ellen,
    how could you take in two more?" my mother''s standard answer was: "if you have
    love in your heart, you will have room in your home." my siblings and i all have
    beautiful memories of our childhood. and ironically, many people we knew thought
    we were the "rich" people in the neighborhood. how right they were! -- robert

    i am one of identical triplet girls. we''re seniors in high school and experiencing
    some identity problems. my sisters and i are good at many of the same things.
    we all play varsity field hockey, are on the cheerleading squad, take many of
    the same classes and share the same circle of friends. my problem is i''m sick
    of being one of the "o''sullivan triplets." i want to be just "caitlin." sometimes
    boys call our house and ask the sister who happens to answer the phone for a date,
    because going out with a triplet is a novelty. other boys who specifically want
    to go out with me become intimidated by my two sisters -- so they get cold feet
    about asking me. only one boy ever wanted to date me because i''m me -- and he
    moved out of state. teachers keep asking which triplet i am. coaches sometimes
    yell at me when their intention is to yell at one of my look-alike sisters. i''m
    so tired of people referring to us as a threesome. my fear is that this won''t
    end with high school graduation, because for financial reasons, we''re all going
    to the same college. don''t get me wrong, abby, i love my sisters dearly -- but
    i''m ready to be my own person. how can i accomplish this without quitting the
    sports i love, giving up the friends i share with my sisters, or switching schools?

    at 48 years of age, i finally need your help in figuring this one out. a year
    ago, after more than 22 years of marriage, my 58-year-old wife, "cindy," began
    sleeping with her 90-year-old mother. cindy says she does this so she will hear
    her mother in case she needs help going to the bathroom. our bedroom doors are
    side-by-side, and i can hear her mother clearly from our bedroom. when her mother
    gets up to go to the bathroom, i hear cindy tell her to "go ahead" and let her
    know if she needs help. in other words, her mother can do this -- and many more
    things -- on her own. on the positive side, cindy may make it into the guinness
    book of world records as the oldest person still sleeping with her mother. what
    do you make of this? -- neglected in georgia'

    i have been dating a wonderful man for the past four years and have no doubt of
    his love for me -- or the belief that eventually we will be married. my problem
    is i''m at the age where most of my friends and acquaintances are getting engaged,
    married and having babies, so naturally the marriage question comes up all the
    time. i don''t mind answering questions like, "when are you two going to tie the
    knot?" however, i need some ideas for a tactful -- yet forceful -- way to answer
    those rude and condescending people who ask, "well, is he ever going to marry
    you?" that question makes me bristle and causes me to feel defensive when there
    is nothing to be defensive about. i need a ladylike reply that will let the offending
    parties understand in no uncertain terms that i am taken aback by the phrasing
    of their question. thanks, abby. -- bride-to-be (eventually) in oxford, miss.'

    i am a middle-aged female office worker who has a big problem with one of my two
    bosses, "mr. x." i have no respect for him. he frequently views pornography on
    my computer and isn''t very adept at covering his tracks. sometimes i suspect
    he actually wants me to know what he''s up to. twice this man has left disks behind
    containing x-rated material, and i''ve seen vast numbers of x-rated web site titles
    that he apparently visits almost daily -- either before i arrive or after i leave
    the office. upon returning to my cubicle after lunch last week, i actually caught
    mr. x viewing porn at my desk. in his haste to get rid of it, he accidentally
    minimized the photo he''d been viewing, rather than closing it out -- which left
    me stuck with having to delete it. (i have always deleted these items when i discovered
    them.) i think mr. x''s behavior is extremely creepy. i almost feel like i''m
    being sexually harassed. what should i do, abby? should i confront him, talk to
    my other boss (who is clueless to the problem), consult an attorney or continue

    our family had a very unpleasant experience last fourth of july. in the early
    afternoon, my 20-year-old daughter was gardening in the front yard of her home
    near the university she attends when she was struck by a bullet. not realizing
    the nature of her injury, my daughter thought she had broken a bone or pulled
    something in her leg. in the hospital emergency room, the admitting nurse recognized
    the wound for what it was and called the police. the bullet had entered the back
    of her leg above the knee, traveled down, and lodged between the bones above her
    ankle. the doctors decided to leave the bullet where it is. according to the police,
    the gun could have been discharged blocks away, and it was probably fired by someone
    celebrating the holiday. don''t people realize that bullets come down with almost
    as much force as they go up? here in portland, it is against the law to discharge
    a firearm within city limits. my precious daughter could have been hit in the

    i feel lucky to have a wonderful circle of friends. we''ve always been there for
    each other, in good times and bad. however, one of these individuals (i''ll call
    her ruth) has a more affluent lifestyle than the rest of us. ruth and her husband
    earn professional incomes that allow her to enjoy the finer things in life. she
    is well aware of the fact that most of us are unable to live the way she does.
    the problem: when any of us purchases new clothing, furniture, etc., she invariably
    asks -- in front of everyone -- where it came from, who designed it, if it was
    on sale, etc. apparently this information is important to her because she''s always
    talking about where she purchased her designer outfit and how much it cost. can
    you give me a clever comeback for the next time the interrogation begins? i''d
    like to put ruth in her place without destroying our friendship. by the way, she''s
    pretty good about dishing out criticism, but not at taking it. -- offended in

    a few weeks before our son''s first birthday, my mother-in-law asked what we were
    buying for him. i told her i hadn''t decided yet, but i knew what i wanted to
    get him when he was older. well, she bought him the toy i mentioned. abby, it
    says right on the box: "choking hazard -- not for children under 3." when my husband
    gently pointed out that the gift was "too old" for our son, she snapped, "it''s
    all plastic parts!" and changed the subject. since then, she has asked us how
    he likes it. we have put her off by saying we haven''t had time to put it together.
    i feel that warnings are placed on toys for good reason. i refuse to put my child
    in danger. should we lie and tell her he likes the toy and put it in storage for
    a few years? what will we do when she visits? we don''t want to hurt her feelings,

    my husband, "jack," and i (both 55) retired two years ago from the military. we
    bought a nice home in las vegas with a small pool and hot tub in the back yard.
    since we have 9-foot privacy walls surrounding the yard, we enjoy using our spa
    every night in the buff. one evening three weeks ago, jack caught a glimpse of
    our next-door neighbor, "maria," peeking over the privacy wall. she is a 49-year-old
    widow and must have been standing on a stepladder to get a good look. we tried
    not to let her know we saw her, but several nights thereafter, she did it again.
    maria is a good friend, and each saturday morning she and i have coffee at a little
    coffee shop nearby. last saturday, maria made a comment about how well-endowed
    jack is, so i asked her how she knew. she replied, "oh, i can just tell." then
    i said, "i''ll bet you''ve been peeking at us in the spa." maria became enraged
    and stormed out of the coffee shop. abby, she hasn''t spoken to me since. i told
    jack what she said, and ever since he''s been preening like a peacock. he thinks
    the whole thing is hilarious, but i miss her friendship. she will not answer my

    your reply to the ex-wife concerning whether or not to attend her ex-spouse''s

    want her to attend their father''s funeral. it would be insulting to have to "ask
    permission" for your own mother to attend your father''s funeral. children of
    divorce are the victims of a relationship gone awry. when a parent dies, they
    shouldn''t be victimized again. allow the children closure, no matter what wife
    no. 2 prefers. the funeral will be the last time the children see their parents

    i am a wife and mother of four who works full time. my time with my family is
    limited. over the past four months, it has become even more so because of a weekend
    house guest. ever since my best friend, "loretta," began dating my brother, she
    has invited herself to spend every weekend at my house. this is due to the fact
    that she lives a couple of hours from the city in which we all reside. what makes
    matters worse is that loretta baby-sits for other people while they go out of
    town, and she''ll bring the child (or children) with her to our house! i was raised
    to believe that you don''t just invite yourself to someone else''s home, and i
    consider loretta''s behavior extremely rude. how can i stop this without reducing
    myself to her level of rudeness? abby, please help! -- wanting my house back in

    after days of meeting in vatican city, the u.s. cardinals came to an official
    agreement on zero tolerance for child molesters. they say, "one strike and you''re
    out." i am enraged and deeply saddened that it took a group of grown men a trip
    halfway around the globe to conclude the obvious. were they perhaps considering
    other options -- like three strikes and you''re out? the real humdinger is that
    they will not necessarily apply the zero-tolerance rule to priests who molested
    children years ago but have repented and are well-received by their community.

    i am the executive secretary for the president of a large national company. my
    office overlooks the entrance to the building, so i see everyone who enters or
    leaves. a few months ago, while standing at my window talking to a male staff
    member, i saw a woman i''ll call "lois" leave the building, get into a car and
    leave with the driver. i commented to the staffer, "isn''t that nice? there''s
    lois leaving for lunch with her husband." the man replied, "that''s not her husband;
    that''s her latest boyfriend." abby, i have seen lois leave and return in that
    car at least twice a week for months. i assumed it was her husband because she
    has kissed this man goodbye right outside my office window on many occasions.
    the staffer then told me about the affair he''d had with lois that nearly ended
    his marriage -- and i believe it, because a few days ago i spotted her leaving
    with the man again and followed them. i now regret it because i was appalled at
    what i saw when they parked in a remote area. she began undressing in the car!
    most people think lois is a loving wife and mother. she is liked by her manager
    and co-workers. should i go to human resources and report this? what if they don''t
    believe me? how will this reflect on me? i see her in-laws in church every sunday
    and at church functions. should i just sit back and not mention the immorality?

    "grandmother of five in north texas" was surprised that the woman cell phone talker,
    her husband, and "grandmother''s" own husband were upset with her for speaking
    up. she asked, "don''t people care about one another anymore?" something i have
    never seen in your column is a principle i learned many years ago and teach to
    my psychotherapy clients: "help that isn''t asked for never works." unsolicited
    advice -- no matter how well-meaning -- usually flies back in a person''s face
    if he or she doesn''t have agreement from the receiver that the help is wanted.
    an easy way to determine if it is wanted is to say something like, "i have some
    feedback for you -- would you like to hear it?" if the other person says anything
    other than a clear "yes," consider it a "no" and do not offer it. we all learn
    through experience. some people derive more from experience in their learning
    process than others. the woman in the restaurant clearly did not want "grandmother''s"
    help. since she is good at writing, perhaps a better thing for her to do next
    time would be to submit a letter to the editor of her local newspaper. "grandmother''s"

    as a professional wedding coordinator, i must respond to "confused." last year
    i worked on two weddings held only a month apart. i''ll never forget them. the
    first could have been a layout in a fashion magazine. the bride and groom were
    gorgeous, their clothing perfect -- all five bridesmaids were petite and stunning,
    and the male attendants looked like models. however, the behavior of the wedding
    party at the rehearsal and ceremony showed that they valued appearance above all
    else. i later found out that the couple had hired people from their health club
    to serve as their attendants to assure the pictures would look good. i couldn''t
    help but compare the experience with the next wedding i coordinated. the bride
    sat down with me before the rehearsal and told me that her cousin, a bridesmaid,
    was in a wheelchair and very ill. the bride wanted to be sure everything would
    be handled with sensitivity. we discussed the procession, ceremony and reception
    in detail, with the bride''s focus on her cousin''s comfort. it turned out to
    be a glorious day. their love and caring radiated to everyone in attendance. sadly,
    one month later her cousin died. need i tell you which wedding was more beautiful?
    more meaningful? it had nothing to do with physical appearance. the groom whose
    fiancee did not want his friend with the club foot to participate in their wedding
    should take a long, hard look at his bride-to-be. she is either too immature or
    too selfish to understand what their ceremony should really celebrate. -- judy

    many times we were interrupted by this poor bored-to-tears child. i called my
    sister after they left to ask her reason for sending the kid. she accused me of
    not loving my niece and hung up on me! the next day, some friends showed up unannounced
    with their 3- and 5-year-old sons. i ran out to get snacks and returned to total
    chaos. the younger child had trashed my living room and was throwing things at
    my dog. the 5-year-old had gone into my bedroom and was playing with my new, expensive
    guitar, while mom and dad merrily drank beer in the kitchen, ignoring their children.

    i now see the damage i did to my adult children by remaining in an abusive marriage
    during their formative years. they have all been divorced -- one of them twice.
    my husband was verbally, emotionally and physically abusive. i tried to be the
    peacemaker. however, by not standing up to him, i taught my children that they
    should not stand up for themselves. all of them have been verbally abused by their
    spouses and are still intimidated, just as i was. when i was a young wife, women
    were trapped with no place to go when abuse occurred. now, with just one phone
    call to the police, action is taken. i hope someday i can forgive myself for the
    damage i have inflicted on my family. is there a way i can help them now -- or
    is it too late? -- filled with regret in florida'

    i have been working for the same company for more than three years. i have a good

    i don''t know how to handle this delicate situation since he is married. al says
    he and his wife no longer have anything in common -- including sex. al and i are
    good friends, but he has mentioned several times that he wants to take our relationship
    "further." he gets moody because my feelings toward him are not the same. i am
    not physically attracted to al. i don''t like to see him depressed, so i tell
    him things to make him feel good about himself. the problem is, i''m beginning

    i have been married to a wonderful man for more than a year. (we''ve been together
    for seven years.) it''s a second marriage for both of us, and together we''re
    raising four beautiful children. when i married this man, i knew full well his
    sister bitterly disapproved of me but hoped she would get over it with time. now
    that we''ve been happily married for a year, she''s worse than ever. i don''t
    know what i ever did to cause my sister-in-law to hate me. she was like a mother
    figure to my husband when he was young, as she is 25 years older. she disliked
    my husband''s first wife, too, but wasn''t nearly as cruel to her. in fact, now
    that they''re divorced, she''s friendly with her. it''s gotten back to me that
    my sister-in-law has told hurtful lies about me and my children to family members
    and the community. she has also insulted me to my face at family gatherings. now
    i get anxious to the point of feeling ill before attending a family function.
    my mother-in-law sees how much pain her daughter causes me and becomes upset,
    as do my husband and children. everyone thinks she is jealous of me. that''s no
    excuse, as far as i''m concerned. i am a respected mother and wife and have given

    i have a question about second weddings. at age 20 i was married briefly. it was
    a big mistake. my boyfriend and i had lived together during college in our small
    midwest town, and we gave in to the pressure to tie the knot rather than continue
    "shacking up." my wedding quickly became "my mother''s wedding." she completely
    took over and ran the show. i wanted fresh flowers -- i got silk. i wanted ivory
    china -- i got white. i wanted a small, private wedding -- i was stuck with 562
    people i barely knew. she even selected my dior wedding gown and veil, and considering
    mom was footing the entire bill, i felt obligated to yield. i later threw the
    dress away -- i hated it that much. on top of all that, i didn''t want to get
    married in the first place, and told my mother as much. by then, however, the
    invitations were out and i felt stuck. please keep in mind i was only 20, abby.
    that was nine years ago; i would never be steamrolled like that today! now i am
    engaged to a wonderful man. this is his first marriage. we are planning (and paying
    for) a small but formal event, and i want this wedding to be mine. if i don''t
    get to plan it my way, the opportunity will have passed me by. above all, i want
    the experience of shopping for and choosing my dream bridal dress. i''d like to
    wear an ivory gown with no train and a simple, long veil that would drag as a
    kind of train. certain people have told me i should not do this. what do you think,

    what is the meaning of memorial day? that is a question i asked a group of children
    visiting our nation''s capital a few years ago. their reply: "it''s the day the
    swimming pools open." that innocent response launched an effort to reclaim memorial
    day for the noble and patriotic purpose for which it was intended. with the help
    of u.s. senator chuck hagel, the national moment of remembrance was established
    by an act of congress. president bush and the congress strongly support this demonstration
    of national unity, which calls for all americans to pause and reflect for one
    minute wherever they may be at 3 p.m. (local time) on memorial day, in remembrance
    of those who have died to preserve our freedom. those who are driving can turn
    on their vehicle headlights, and we encourage the playing of "taps" at public
    events and on radio and television stations. since our nation was founded, almost
    2 million men and women have sacrificed their lives to defend and preserve this
    precious land of hopes and dreams. we are all connected as americans and should
    all feel a kinship -- especially on memorial day. their ultimate sacrifice continues
    to live in each constitutional right we enjoy. on memorial day we hope your readers
    will please join together in solidarity with those whose grief is fresh and deep,
    to express their gratitude to the men and women who have died that we might live
    in freedom. in the words of author herman wouk, "the beginning of the end of war
    lies in remembrance." -- carmella la spada, executive director, white house commission

    up the entire airline seat. the plane had three seats on one side of the aisle.
    two seats on the other. i had the window seat on the side with two seats. a good-looking
    gentleman (if you consider a cary grant look-alike good-looking) sat down beside
    me. he greeted me with a "good morning," and a great smile. as he buckled his
    seat belt, he said, "i always feel cramped in these seats. would you mind if i
    raised the armrest between us?" i know he didn''t feel cramped. he wanted to make
    sure i was more comfortable. during our flight, he complimented me on my hairstyle
    and the "lovely dress" i was wearing. his remarks had a lasting effect on me,

    who delivers furniture. everybody knows that pizza delivery people get tips, but
    shouldn''t other kinds of delivery people as well? furniture deliverers move heavy
    objects like couches, armoires and beds -- and they often assemble the items they
    deliver. sometimes they''re also willing to haul unwanted furniture and appliances
    off the premises. what''s your opinion, abby? is tipping necessary? -- two guys

    i am 43 and deeply in love. for five years i have been dating a 57-year-old man
    i''ll call ray. when ray enters a room, i honestly feel my heart skip a beat.
    although we do not live together, we share many of the same interests and have
    lots of fun together. my problem is that ray has a mean streak. if i complain,
    he has a sarcastic answer or turns it around and blames me. for example, i was
    diagnosed with cancer last fall and needed emergency surgery. the day after my
    surgery, ray left on a 10-day golf trip with his buddies. i felt alone and abandoned.
    when i told him how i felt, he said my illness couldn''t have been that serious
    because i survived. ray likes to be around his friends and family but rarely includes
    me. when i suggest that i''d like to be a more important part of his life, he
    tells me i am too "clingy." in our five years together, i have spent several christmases
    and most valentine days alone, and i sit around while he takes numerous vacations
    with other people. ray tells me he loves me, but doesn''t want to marry me. dating
    is a comfortable arrangement for him. he gave me a diamond "friendship ring" for

    my mother is being married again this summer. this is her fifth marriage, and
    i fear she is doing it for all the wrong reasons. it all started 30 years ago
    when, as a teen-ager, she married my father. she married him to get away from
    her family. my father abused her, she divorced him, then remarried him again.
    they stayed together 10 more miserable years before divorcing. within three months
    she met and married another man. he was addicted to "the chase." mother was his
    fifth wife. (he is currently on no. 8.) she divorced him and married husband no.
    3, even though he was obviously drug-addicted. it eventually caused their divorce.
    for the past few months, my mother has been looking for love on the internet and
    through personal newspaper ads. within two weeks, she found a man she claimed
    to love. they picked a wedding date. he was a drug addict and dealer who ended
    up taking everything from mom''s house. fortunately, they did not marry. mom has
    recently met another man on the internet -- a recovering alcoholic, active in
    meetings and social functions. of all the men she has brought home, he is definitely
    the best prospect for marriage. she confided that she is not in love with him,
    but they have set a summer wedding date. she feels love will come later, and she
    "likes" him enough to marry him. i should mention that mother is a successful
    professional woman with a great job. she owns a beautiful home and is financially
    secure. however, she is very lonely, has no friends, rarely speaks to her 10 siblings
    -- and hardly ever visits me and my daughter, even though we live only 20 minutes
    away. we have had a strained relationship for years. i feel that she abandons
    me whenever a new man enters the picture. i want what''s best for her, but i don''t
    believe she has the self-confidence or insight to pick a man who doesn''t come
    with a lot of "baggage." can you think of anything i can say or do to make my
    mother reconsider this marriage and start getting some therapy? -- daughter of

    a year ago, i led a picture-perfect life. i was a junior at a prestigious university,
    an all-american wrestler, in a wonderful relationship with my fiancee, "libby,"
    the father of a handsome 19-month-old son, driving a luxury car and living in
    a three-bedroom home. all of that came to an end. i was living two lives. one
    part of me was an honor student, loving boyfriend and father. the other was a
    violent drug dealer. libby had no clue about what i was doing. she thought i was
    a club promoter and that was why i was out most nights. abby, i wasn''t promoting
    clubs. i was selling boatloads of ecstasy. last summer, i told libby i had to
    go to los angeles to promote a club event. another lie. i went to l.a. to pick
    up more ecstasy. i never made it home. i was arrested, tried, and sentenced to
    four years in prison. when i told libby the truth, she left me. she and my son
    moved 2,000 miles away to live with her family. for the past year, i have written
    libby, but she doesn''t answer my letters. i understand she and my mother talk
    and write to each other frequently. my mother is desperately trying to get us
    back together, but i don''t think there is any hope for us. my mother says there
    is always hope. when i get out, i''ll need to get my act together and finish my
    last year of college. i can''t bear the thought of not marrying libby and settling
    down with her and my son. i am sorry for what i have done, but she is hurt and
    unable to forgive me. can you think of anything i can do or say to get libby and
    my son back in my life? -- stuck between a rock and a very hard place'

    for years my husband and i worked at various private summer camps across the southeast.
    it always amazed us that parents would send their children to camps without thoroughly
    checking the conditions of these places. what are these parents thinking? the
    camp sales videos show only what the owners want the parents to see. a few pointers
    when selecting a camp: (1) make sure the camp is safe. don''t take anyone''s word
    for it. (2) if your children went last year, quiz them about the activities in
    order to find out if they really do get to participate in everything the video
    claims. question them about the plumbing, lighting and water. children are not
    dumb. if they observed a problem last year, chances are they''ll remember it.
    (3) ask if you can drop in on your kids during camp session. if you do and are
    asked to wait in the office while they''re brought to you, ask why you can''t
    meet them wherever they happen to be at that time. (4) if you take your kids to
    camp, walk around and take a good look. don''t just check out the bunks. walk
    through the kitchen, the infirmary, and examine the play equipment they will be
    using. (5) ask if your children''s possessions will be stored in a secure location.
    (6) find out how your kids'' money is taken care of. where can it be kept safe,
    and what is the procedure if their money is taken? (7) last, if your child constantly
    complains about camp -- listen. you may be getting a dose of the truth. hope this
    helps, abby. thanks for letting us vent. -- frustrated in georgia'

    we''ve been sent an invitation to our nephew "marshall''s" high school graduation.
    last night we found out he won''t be graduating because he failed a couple of
    classes. marshall''s school allows all seniors to "walk across the stage" at the
    graduation ceremony, even though some of them may not be actually receiving a
    diploma. when i asked marshall''s mother, my sister, whether he should receive
    graduation gifts and have a family party, she gave me a firm "no." his grandmother
    is upset and insists we still have a graduation party with presents. personally,
    i don''t think there should be a party with presents since marshall is not really
    graduating. who knows if he will ever graduate? what are we celebrating -- his
    high school failure? what do you think? -- disgusted aunt in florida'

    i am writing to you as a last resort. please print my letter so i can get help.
    i am a young teen who feels like committing suicide. my parents work long hours
    and provide a roof over our heads and food on the table, but we spend hardly any
    time together. while i have suffered no physical abuse, i''ve been hurt by my
    mother''s verbal abuse. i think i''m depressed because in a survey i took at school,
    i matched the profile of a person suffering from depression. i can''t tell my
    parents, although i have tried numerous times. when i told mom i wanted to see
    a psychiatrist, she said "no." i''ve tried talking to teachers but nothing works.
    is there something i can do without involving other people? no matter what i say,
    no one takes me seriously. my friends think i''m joking when i tell them how i
    feel. i want help -- i want to live -- but if there''s no help, there''s no point.
    i''ve thought about suicide a lot and put a knife to my wrist. i''ve hurt myself
    by hitting a wall and injuring my hand. sometimes i cut my fingers, but people
    always believe me when i say it was an "accident." i''m tired of living a lie,

    a few months ago, my husband was promoted, but it required our relocating to another
    state. our daughter, "alicia," is an honor student and involved in many activities.
    because she''s a junior in high school, she was reluctant to change schools in
    the middle of the year. my mother-in-law, "claire," lives in the same school district,
    and offered to let alicia live with her after we moved. alicia and claire are
    close, and my husband and i thought it was a good plan. last week, we flew in
    to surprise alicia at her "sweet 16" birthday party. we were shocked to see our
    daughter answer the door smoking a cigarette. alicia admits that after we moved,
    she was curious about smoking and asked claire (a pack-a-day smoker) for a cigarette.
    claire has been buying alicia cigarettes ever since. (claire says she doesn''t
    like to smoke alone.) abby, i don''t know who is more to blame -- alicia for starting
    to smoke, or claire for encouraging it. i am ready to take alicia back with us,
    but my husband disagrees. he says while she made a foolish mistake to start smoking,
    alicia is no longer a baby and should be able to make her own decisions -- even
    if they are bad. i admit i used to smoke as a teen-ager, but it took me 20 years
    to quit. i don''t want my daughter to have the same struggle. any suggestions?

    recently my son entered a derby car race at his cub scout meeting. he left the
    house proud of the derby car he fashioned from a block of wood. my husband had
    shown him how to use the proper tools, to sand and paint the car -- but it was
    our son''s design. when my son and husband arrived at the race track, it was obvious
    many of the fathers had done far more than supervise the making of the derby cars.
    in fact, many of the fathers bragged about how they had designed, cut and painted
    their sons'' cars -- even going so far as adding "hidden" weights so they would
    go faster! one of the youngest boys in the pack won a huge trophy for "best in
    show." his car was elaborately carved and decorated far beyond his capabilities.
    we told our son he should be proud of his car because he had followed instructions
    and created it himself. unfortunately, some of the other boys made our son feel
    their dads loved them more because they had made prettier, faster cars for them.
    abby, i am afraid this is another example of parents reliving their youth at the

    my wife and i have worked hard all our lives and raised three wonderful children.
    she''s retired now, but still works part time at another job. i plan to retire
    in three years. we are at a point in our lives that we can take weekend trips
    and one or two vacations a year. it''s our way of unwinding and enjoying each
    other. the problem? my mother. dad died a few years ago and mom thinks everyone
    should think only of her. i am the oldest of three brothers and, trust me, abby,
    all of us in the family do far more for her than most families would. that doesn''t
    stop mom from throwing hints around about feeling left out when my wife and i
    don''t include her in our getaways. mom is on the go all the time, but to hear
    her tell it, she sits at home by herself day after day. when we call her, all
    she does is complain that no one ever calls or comes to see her. nothing could
    be further from the truth. we have a schedule so that someone in the family calls
    her every morning and afternoon. help! -- frustrated son in nashville'

    i recently married a wonderful woman with an adorable, energetic 3-year-old daughter.
    my concern is my wife''s mother, "julia." she''s a fine mother/mother-in-law,
    and the greatest grandmother in the world, but she harbors an intense dislike
    for my wife''s ex-husband, "trevor." every time trevor''s name is mentioned, julia
    says something negative about him. she refuses to talk to him or be in his presence.
    if she happens to be at our home when trevor comes to pick up his daughter for
    visitation, she''ll leave the room and go to a back bedroom. everyone in the family
    has discussed this with julia, including my wife''s grandmother. however, every
    time we raise the subject, she becomes angry at us. while my wife and her ex were
    not good as a couple, this man has been nothing but a loving, patient and supportive
    father. he shows up on time, almost never cancels, pays his child support in full
    -- and my stepdaughter is always excited to see him. my concern is that my mother-in-law''s
    anger toward trevor will eventually confuse my stepdaughter. although she is young
    now, there will come a time when she''ll be old enough to know something is wrong.

    i am a 20-year-old woman who enjoys singing, crafts and working with children.
    i appear normal and i''m almost always pleasant. why do i make that statement?
    because i have a mental illness, and there is still a stigma. people sometimes
    feel uneasy when with me. while over the years the stigma has lessened, it still
    remains to some degree. i have been treated like a child, been the topic of gossip,
    lost friends in the church, and have been feared and ostracized because of my
    illness. after a few dates with a man, i feel i must disclose that i have some
    emotional problems -- including bipolar disorder. my date invariably reacts like
    he''s trapped in the car with a rabid animal. abby, i am not crazy, dangerous
    or contagious! the men i date don''t have to be afraid of me. however, when the
    truth comes out, my gentlemen friends run like scared rabbits. it''s very hurtful.
    i want to be treated with understanding and respect, not punished for an illness
    i didn''t ask for. how nice it would be to have a male friend who doesn''t back
    away because of misinformation about mental disorders. please ask your readers
    to give people with mental illness time to prove they are not monsters, just people
    who, for the most part, lead normal lives and have needs, wishes and feelings
    like everyone else. -- hopeful in virginia'

    the other day a friend''s wife, "mimi," commented that she needed a new wardrobe
    because of her recent breast augmentation. i was taken aback because i didn''t

    i am 50 years old, married for 28 years, and have two adult children -- the eldest
    25. in 1967, my steady high school girlfriend, "maggie," became pregnant with

    maggie was three months pregnant. our families were supportive, despite their
    disappointment. they offered emotional and financial assistance. a few days before
    the wedding, i got cold feet. i knew i was not ready for marriage, and i told
    our minister, who told maggie''s parents. the wedding was canceled. maggie was
    sent to a maternity home two states away. she gave birth to a son who was placed
    for adoption. maggie''s father vowed i would never see his daughter again and
    would not allow her to return home. she was sent to live with relatives. maggie
    and i did stay in contact through a friend during the year after the baby was
    born. the experience was never again mentioned in my family. abby, i am still
    haunted by my cowardice. my wife knows about my first child, but i have never
    told my children. now that they are grown, i wonder if i should. my wife said

    we live in a small town and have been restoring a 100-year-old victorian home
    since our marriage; we''ve put a lot of our heart and soul into this house. we
    have terrific neighbors, and it is a beautiful neighborhood. we chose to live
    in this small town because my husband was previously married and has three children
    who live here with their mother. at the time, we thought it would be a good idea
    so he could remain close to the children. we get along well with them, see them
    often, and can attend their school and sporting activities. the problem: my husband''s
    ex has started parking three doors up the street and walks, jogs, bikes and skates
    around our house. when i say "around," i mean we live on a corner with an alley
    in the back, so it is literally "around" the house. we feel like we''re being
    circled by a vulture watching our every move. my husband says he feels that she''s
    invading our privacy, especially when it''s his visitation with the kids. in the
    summer, this happens on a daily basis -- sometimes twice a day. my husband asked
    her to find another way to go, but she says she''s not doing anything wrong and
    refuses. we have thought of moving, but this is a small town and we are afraid
    she would follow us. my husband grew up in this town and his parents, grandparents,

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have a 12-year-old son who is academically gifted. he understands, speaks and
    reads on a much higher level than the sixth-grade program he is in. unfortunately,
    the schools in our area are limited in their ability to deal with gifted students.
    one teacher told me that the gifted program my son is currently in is not challenging
    him, while another teacher has suggested he bring down his level of speech, reading,
    etc., to the level of the other students in his class so that he can fit in more
    easily. my concern is that my son will become bored with school and quit, or get
    so depressed about not fitting in that he may get himself into trouble. what can
    i do to foster his intelligence, abby? emotionally he is a 12-year-old, but his
    intellectual capacity is so far advanced, it''s becoming difficult to strike the
    right balance. all this boy wants is to communicate with kids his own age who
    have the same abilities and interests that he has. any suggestions would be appreciated.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i hope you can stand another wedding-related disaster. i was married last october.
    my husband and i both wanted a small wedding because we couldn''t afford a large
    one. we planned to elope and be married with only our parents and siblings as
    guests. the idea was to spend a fun weekend at a local inn. my mother-in-law suggested
    that we include a few of our closest friends. therefore, my husband and i each
    invited six friends and their dates/spouses. a total of 33 people attended the
    wedding, and it was exactly what we wanted. i plan to throw a party for other
    relatives later this year. however, none of mine are speaking to me! they say
    i wrote them off by excluding them from the wedding -- that i chose friends over
    family, and some other hurtful comments. when i explained that my husband''s aunts,
    uncles and cousins weren''t invited either and expressed their happiness for us,
    my relatives didn''t care. my husband comes from a prominent family, and my side
    of the family is using that against me. they insist i am ashamed of them and think
    they''re not good enough. i thought throwing a party for everyone afterward would
    solve the problem. however, after what my relatives have said, i don''t want to
    waste our money on them. i doubt they''d come anyway, since we''re not speaking.
    abby, is one obligated to invite relatives to one''s wedding? is there an invitation

    two weeks ago, my friend "shannon" came over with her children for a play date.
    as she backed out of my driveway, she accidentally hit my mailbox. she was very
    shaken up at the time. i was more concerned that no one was injured because my
    mailbox is set into a large concrete post and shannon''s car was damaged. she
    promised she''d "take care of it." i told her to drive home safely; we''d discuss
    it another time. my husband, who is not fond of this couple and vice versa, said
    i should have filed a police report, given the cost of the damage was $350. i
    told him i didn''t think it was necessary because shannon had promised to take
    care of it. two weeks went by; she never called. because of my husband''s dislike
    for her, the situation escalated into a daily argument at my house. when i finally
    called her, shannon informed me she wasn''t interested in spending money on my
    mailbox and didn''t understand what i needed a $350 mailbox for. my husband called
    her husband the following day to ask why he and his wife thought they were not
    responsible. the husband said, "your friendship isn''t worth $350. a friend would
    never ask a friend for the money. i''ll send you $150 and don''t ever call us
    again." a short while later, shannon called me screaming, "how dare your husband
    call mine at work? i''ll send you the $150, and i''m never speaking to you again!"
    then she hung up on me. i''m so hurt. i thought these people were friends. was
    i wrong to expect them to pay for the damage? was my husband out of line to try
    and discuss this with them? aren''t they responsible? my husband wants to sue
    them in small claims court. her husband even told mine to go ahead and try. i
    don''t want to drag myself through it. your thoughts, please. -- hurt in coral

    my husband and i will celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in a few months.
    when he asks me what i want, how do i hint to him that i''d like a modest engagement
    ring without having to come right out with it? i have never had one, and i have
    never taken off my wedding band during our entire marriage. in fact, i have never
    worn another ring on my hands out of respect for my wedding band. i would like
    a small "sparkler" to go along with it, but i''m embarrassed to tell him. it seems
    almost greedy. although we probably should keep all our savings for retirement,
    we could be frivolous and spend several hundred dollars without breaking the bank.

    our son was married last year. there were many out-of-town relatives from the
    bride''s family, plus a large wedding party. once the parents and grandparents
    of the bride and groom were added to the list, close to 80 people attended the
    rehearsal dinner. we did not invite family members who didn''t have a part in
    the ceremony, although spouses of the wedding party were included. a few weeks
    before the big day, my husband''s uncle charlie (who is close to 80), let us know
    he was very hurt not to be invited to the rehearsal dinner. he made it clear he
    expected us to make an exception for him because he and my husband have always
    been close. my husband explained to charlie that if we made an exception for him,
    we would risk offending other relatives who were not included. he seemed to accept
    the decision. it has been many months since the wedding, and it''s obvious that
    uncle charlie is nursing a grudge. at family gatherings, he takes every opportunity
    to challenge anything my husband says to belittle him. he even collected articles
    on wedding etiquette, invited my husband to lunch and tried to get him to read
    them. if my son gets wind of this, he won''t tiptoe around uncle charlie''s feelings
    as his dad has always done. there will be a permanent rift in the family. abby,
    is there anything i can do or say to resolve this? -- the peacemaker'

    i have worn a hairpiece for about 15 years and have been at my present job for
    the past five. my toupee was expensive and it''s not obvious. i have never told
    anyone at work that my full head of hair isn''t natural. last weekend at a work-related

    over cocktails that i wear a hairpiece. after we left the party, i became angry
    with her for making this revelation, but she refused to accept why i was so upset.
    then my wife had the nerve to say, "don''t you think they already know you wear
    a toupee?" i told her i didn''t think they had any idea, but that was beside the
    point. the important thing was that i felt she betrayed a confidence. now she
    wants to ask someone impartial whether or not she goofed -- so i''m asking you,

    to me our relationship is based solely on sex. roy tells me all the time how much
    he loves me, but i think it''s the sex he loves. from my perspective, we really
    don''t have anything in common. he is currently separated from his wife and has
    a 16-year-old daughter who doesn''t know about me. roy lives in another state,
    but we see each other often. last week he told me that when his divorce is final,
    he wants to marry me. i was ok with it until i did some serious thinking. roy
    asked me if i had a problem with his age, and i said no -- although the fact that
    he''s old enough to be my father does bother me. i don''t know what to do, abby.
    if i break it off with him, he''s not going to take it well -- i just know it.

    you were a little rough on "tom" in your reply to "the office gang," the letter
    about the female trucker who kept coming on to the only man in the office. you
    implied he was like a little boy who lacked courage. i must disagree with you.
    take it from one who knows: i''ve been in tom''s predicament more than once. in
    the workplace when a woman is interested in a man, she usually lets him know discreetly.
    they can then proceed with a relationship if they''re both interested, or quietly
    let it go. then there''s the occasional woman who won''t take no for an answer.
    what starts as a nice ego boost can turn unpleasant in a hurry. we men are taught
    from an early age to respect women and not show aggression toward them. persistent
    females who show sexual aggression when we''re not interested present males with
    a real problem. i think tom is trying his best to defuse a delicate situation.
    he wants this woman to back off, but he also wants to be polite and not cause
    problems for himself, the woman or his co-workers. he is not being a coward, abby

    my fiance''s sister was married three weeks ago. it was the most unorganized,
    chaotic mess i''ve ever seen. the night before the wedding, she called me, frantically
    asking if i could come early to the hall to "help make bows." i immediately agreed.
    by the time the conversation ended, she had given me a list a mile long of "last-minute
    details" she had forgotten. i felt obligated to help, knowing she, her mother
    and bridesmaids would all be busy getting ready for the wedding. i spent more
    than $100 on balloons, toothpicks, 15 yards of lovely fabric, a fountain pen,
    ice, etc. -- and i single-handedly arranged all the flowers and decorated the
    hall. i finished as the guests arrived. of course, no chairs had been set up for
    them to sit on, so i pointed to a stack of them in the corner and ran home to
    change into something clean. when i returned, the ceremony was over. but i was
    just in time to start serving food, as no caterers had been hired. i went home
    exhausted and feeling terribly used. i barely got a thank-you for my efforts.
    the next morning, the bride called to ask if i could dry all the roses for her
    because a florist was going to make her a keepsake arrangement. the bride has
    now returned from her honeymoon. i''ve given her all the receipts for my expenditures,

    as a single father of three girls (two grown and a 13-year-old still at home with
    me), i must say to all parents: fitting in is part of life. nobody wants to be
    poked fun at because his or her family''s views are different. growing up today
    is hard enough. why add pressures? there are many topics that should be openly
    discussed between children and parents, but if a parent feels uncomfortable about
    it, so will the child. i remember many times over the years i had to discuss,
    purchase or attend to things that a girl''s mother would normally do. some made
    me feel uncomfortable; however, i did them anyway. parents should strive for open
    two-way communication with their children. we pass along the morals, values and
    rules we were taught so they can modify them and teach them to their own children

    my husband''s brother was married to "ellie" for 17 years. she was a wonderful
    woman. they had two great kids. ellie always treated his parents and siblings
    with respect. sadly, they were not as nice to her. in spite of it, she considered
    them her family. when ellie finally decided to divorce my brother-in-law, after
    years of emotional and verbal abuse by him and his parents, it was a gut-wrenching
    decision. although ellie and my brother-in-law continued living together for more
    than a year while their divorce was pending, my in-laws cut off all contact with
    her. they removed her pictures from the walls of their home, "uninvited" her to
    a family wedding for which she had already attended the bridal shower, and never
    once asked her children (their grandchildren) about her. it was as if ellie never
    existed. she was very hurt, but never bad-mouthed any of them to her kids. shortly
    after the divorce was final, my brother-in-law died in a car accident at the age
    of 47. ellie''s children, now 13 and 11, no longer want anything to do with their
    grandparents. they feel very angry about the way their mother was treated. ellie
    has told them she would like them to have a relationship with their dad''s family,

    i could have been the teen-ager in the letter signed "had it in denver." he was
    the live-in grandfather who complained about his 15-year-old granddaughter''s
    bratty behavior. my grandmother moved in with my family when i was 15. she shared
    my room; we even slept in the same bed. it was no secret that i wasn''t happy
    about it. i was jealous of the time grandma spent with my mom and dad. i never
    yelled at my parents, but did a few things i was sorry about later. that grandpa
    in denver should talk with his granddaughter and find out her interests and concerns.
    (that''s what my grandma did.) if grandpa and the girl could find anything in
    common, maybe he could help her, rather than making things worse by complaining.
    as far as gramps'' objection to "no rules, no discipline, no punishment, no guidelines"
    in their home, i ask, "oh, really?" house rules may have changed big time in the
    last 50 years. maybe gramps'' rules are stricter than her parents''. over time,
    my grandmother and i became good friends. i even interviewed her for my senior
    term paper on dating customs prior to world war i. it was a hit. (now those were
    the days of strict rules and regulations!) in 1966, my beloved grandma died at
    the age of 75, three months after my first child was born. i shall forever treasure

    i am 11 years old. my family keeps telling me i am gaunt and too thin. i think
    i am fat -– way fat. from my point of view, i have an enormous stomach, big legs,

    the letters about the doctors who had themselves paged repeatedly to advertise
    themselves reminded me of my student days when i worked part time in a health
    clinic. every morning, i would hear a "dr. duncan" being asked to report to the
    lobby. i had never heard of a doctor by that name working there. i finally found
    out that "dr. duncan" was clinic "code" to let everyone who had time to take a
    break know that the snack truck had arrived at the back entrance. that explained
    why coffee and doughnuts would suddenly appear all over the building after the

    why is it that men can be so insensitive toward recent widows? some of them hit
    on us within a month of the death of our loved one, while we''re still in shock.
    who are these culprits? co-workers whom i thought were good friends and my church
    council president, to name a few. once, while i was having coffee in a restaurant
    with a friend, a male acquaintance stopped by our table and -- as calmly as ordering
    a hamburger -- told me his wife was in the hospital and he "needed some lovin''"!
    don''t these clods have any idea how demeaning and vulgar their behavior is? a
    longtime friend of mine just lost her husband. she didn''t believe me when i told
    her about my experience. abby, within a month, she had her own stories to tell!
    what''s astonishing is that 90 percent of these men are married. when my husband
    was alive, i had great respect for men. for that, i credit my husband, who was
    an honorable and loving family man. now, however, i''m whistling a different tune.

    "regretful" could have stepped up and asked todd, the shy guy, out for a cup of
    coffee. (how simple!) this somewhat current -- in the scope of modern history
    -- mostly american habit of women playing coy rarely works out well. i believe
    that a woman waiting for her knight on a white horse is a stupid fantasy that
    has been sold to us by the entertainment industry for the last 75 years. someone
    once said: "where are all the nice men? well, they''re usually standing right
    next to you." i have talked to many senior citizens, in particular senior women.
    i always asked them the same question: "did you court or somehow ''go after''
    your husband"? about 75 percent of these women admitted they had made the first
    move to get their man''s attention -- dropping by the pond where they fished,
    or asking them about their job or family. abby, i have had two women tell me they
    had a crush on me in high school, and yet these same two women dated only popular
    athletes. i don''t remember either of those beautiful girls looking my way. if
    women want to miss out on the "shy guy" and continue to date the wolves out there,

    that mack has given me a sexually transmitted disease (std) that can cause cancer.

    his std, mack was adamant about not wanting to discuss it. the following morning

    everything i knew about the situation. lois told me mack had said nothing to her
    about any stds, and told me she would ask him about it. later that night, i got
    a call from mack. he was madder than a wet hen! i feel i did the right thing by
    telling lois because he didn''t sound like he would. after all, he never told

    then went behind my back and asked janet to co-sign for an apartment for her and
    one of her girlfriends. without consulting me, janet agreed. well, heather and
    her friend got evicted, owing their landlord $2,400. janet called me and told
    me i should pay her for heather''s portion of the rent. i told her, "sorry, i
    can''t help you." janet became very upset and now refuses to have anything to
    do with me. heather enlisted in the army and is out of the country. janet still
    calls and threatens me. i feel bad about this because she was a good friend. what
    do i do? -- a mother in fresno, calif.'

    i work in the office of a trucking company. one of my four co-workers is a married
    man. i''ll call him tom. the rest of us are females. a divorced female truck driver
    comes into the office and can''t keep her hands off tom. every chance she gets,
    she rubs his neck, shoulders or back while he sits there looking embarrassed.
    she also tells him dirty jokes. the other women and i think her behavior is inappropriate.
    when tom''s wife found out about this gal, she told him to put a stop to it because
    it shows a lack of respect for their marriage. he has asked me and the other women

    the letters about children learning the facts of life reminded me of this old
    story: a country doctor went to deliver a baby. the expectant mother''s 5-year-old
    son was with her and the delivery was imminent. the house had no electricity,
    so the doctor brought out his lantern. he instructed the little fellow to hold
    the lantern while he delivered the baby. after the baby was born, the doctor spanked
    it and it began to cry. turning to the little boy, the doctor asked, "well, son,
    what do you think of your baby brother?" "hit him again," the boy replied. "he
    ought not to have climbed up there in the first place." -- rowena in kansas city,

    two years ago my 2-year-old son died tragically. his death was a great shock to

    took, but i was helpless to stop. even more disturbing, i stole from people i
    love and am very close to. this began soon after the death of my son and stopped
    a few months ago. the death of my son and the terrible guilt i felt over stealing
    nearly drove me to suicide twice. i want very much to return the items i took
    and apologize to the owners. however, i am afraid they will probably say they
    "understand," but they''ll never trust me in their homes again. please don''t
    tell me to seek professional help because my compulsion to steal seems to have
    left me as quickly as it came. i need some answers. i''ve never stolen anything

    was at her friend''s house. she said they both did. it has been bothering me ever

    outright would make her angry or might result in her lying to me, since she knows

    how do you chew out someone whose heart is in the right place? during the cold

    a flag flying from a car at high speed takes a beating. please replace it before
    it turns into a rag. i have seen some so far gone that only half the flag remains.
    i even saw a pair of flags hanging horizontally from a car trunk. they looked
    like mud flaps. if you display a flag at your home, please keep it hanging free.
    if there has been a strong wind, unwind it. if it has caught on the shrubbery,
    please untangle it. finally, a request to the business world: if you use the flag
    in your ads, please don''t alter it. one of our local radio stations went so far
    as to replace the blue field of stars with its own logo. when people get old and

    the "are you an alcoholic?" test you printed listing 12 questions was good as
    far as it went -- but it didn''t go far enough. i''m sure that anyone who was

    read it. where were these questions: when you take one or two drinks, can you
    stop and walk away? have you ever embarrassed yourself or someone else when drinking?
    do you drink every day? how many times in the last month have you awakened with
    a hangover? do you spend money you don''t have on alcohol? has this affected your
    sleeping habits? (do you pass out, get a drink in the middle of the night, or

    i consider myself a happily married woman, and have been since 1988. my husband

    i''m writing concerning the letter about ethnic stereotyping. comedian red skelton
    used to tell a story that perfectly ridiculed such stereotyping: a man was seated
    next to a chinese gentleman at a banquet. attempting to make conversation, the
    man said in chinese pidgin, "you likee food?" just then his table partner was
    introduced to the crowd. he walked to the dais and delivered a beautiful speech
    in perfect english. when he returned to the table, he turned to his seat partner
    and said, "you likee speech?" -- jack runninger, rome, ga.'

    my boss, "adam," is 43. i am 50. we are both divorced. we have become very close
    during the three years we have worked together. i have two adult children. he
    has none. adam and i spend a great deal of time together -- at work and socially
    -- but always on a platonic basis. the problem is, i have fallen in love with
    him. i realize that an on-the-job romance -- especially between a boss and a subordinate
    -- would be a big mistake. however, i know he cares a great deal for me, although
    he does not share my romantic feelings. abby, i am having a hard time hiding my

    i am responding to the letter from "lost mother in the midwest," who suddenly
    left her family because she was overwhelmed with personal problems and felt unneeded
    and alone. i know what it''s like to be one of the children left behind, and i
    cannot be silent. following are some suggestions i would like to offer for "lost
    mother": first, get professional counseling so you understand what led you to
    do such a thing. everyone has problems -- that''s part of life. however, you must
    have the courage to face up to what you''ve done so you can forgive yourself.
    second, when you''re stable enough, contact your children to let them know that
    you''re ok and that you realize you mishandled the situation. they need to know
    that you are seeking help and that you love them. they will be angry, but they
    are entitled to their feelings. it will begin the healing process. no matter how
    painful it may be, it is easier than carrying around a lifetime of guilt and pain.
    third, give your family time to sort out their feelings. at first, they may be
    reluctant to reconcile with you. it will take time and understanding, and may
    not produce the kind of relationship you are immediately hoping for. last, don''t
    delay! your doubts and fears might cause you to chicken out. you left your family,
    so it''s your responsibility to make the first move. every day you wait causes
    more pain and suffering. life is too short to prolong this separation. it will
    be worth it in the end. i wish you and your children well. i speak from experience.
    our mom left us when we were very young. it has been 30 years since we''ve had
    any contact with her. we''ve done everything we know to find her, with no luck.
    if i could somehow communicate a message to our mom, it would be this: everyone
    makes mistakes, but we can try to make up for them. love and forgiveness can go
    a long way. the few memories and mementos we have of you suggest that you were
    a very loving mother. your children are well-adjusted, happy people, and we hope
    this will bring you some comfort. we have forgiven you and want you to know we
    love you. we still live in the same state where you left us. life is getting shorter,
    and we would love to have the opportunity to spend the rest of it with you. so
    what do you say, mom? it''s your move. -- the second of three in south carolina'

    my wife died two years ago. since then, i have had health problems that make it

    i was intrigued by the letter from the spry 81-year-old woman with one equally
    healthy sister, at 90, and one sister with lung disease due to smoking. her daughters
    -- both nurses -- want to make posters for all the junior and senior high schools,
    with pictures of the two "good" sisters climbing mountains or parasailing, and
    the "bad" sister in her wheelchair, complete with oxygen tank. they think it would
    be a great visual aid for their anti-smoking campaign. why stop there? why not
    gather up the pathetic creature in her wheelchair and drag her and her oxygen
    tank around the junior and senior high schools in person? her sisters could do
    cartwheels while she was being exhibited. maybe they could also provide stones
    to throw at the evil one. i''ve seen letters in your column suggesting that when
    someone dies of lung disease, the obituary should make that known, and should
    mention that the dear departed was a smoker (preferably "heavy smoker"). yet so
    far i haven''t noticed any calls for obituaries noting that "jane died of a heart
    attack. she was obese because she ate everything that didn''t bite back." or,
    "henry died of liver disease because he drank like a fish." there''s no end to
    the pleasure we could take in looking down our noses at those people who are not
    as virtuous as we are. my mother died of emphysema. i wish she had lived longer,
    but i thank god for letting me have the kind of mother she was. she was kind,
    compassionate, and never judged anyone harshly, except for people who hurt others.
    she was the opposite of your smug, sanctimonious, holier-than-thou anti-smoking
    zealot and her sisters. to me, anti-smoking fanatics are among the most self-righteous,
    contemptible, vicious people infesting the world today. -- fed up with cold-hearted

    my husband, "john," and i are in our mid-20s. we have been married for over a
    year. during this time his younger sister, "caitlin," has made numerous trips

    i''m not crazy about. john and i live in a one-bedroom apartment, and she has
    only the den couch to sleep on. while this provides her no privacy, she still
    prefers sleeping in the buff. when she undresses for bed, it makes no difference
    if john is present or not. when she wakes up in the morning, she''ll stroll into
    the kitchen "as is" for coffee while on her way to take a shower. if john and
    i are in the kitchen, too, she''s not shy about standing around in her birthday
    suit, chit-chatting with us as she sips her coffee. i''ve always maintained a
    casual attitude about this, but actually, i would prefer not to see her walking
    around in the nude. i realize that females are not required to cover themselves
    around males in their own family. i wasn''t that modest around my brother, either.

    i was physically and emotionally abused by my parents. mother left home when i
    was 11. when i was in my early 20s, i was attacked and raped by a stranger. i
    have been through many abusive relationships and several failed marriages. my
    last two boyfriends were sexually abusive. now i''m afraid of men, and especially
    afraid of sex. about a month ago, i met a man who seemed nice. he gave me his
    number. a week later when i lost my job, i called him to see if he knew of any
    openings. he invited me over to look at my resume, and i went. we began a deep
    friendship. i told him things about my past that gave me low self-esteem. he told
    me he had studied counseling and asked if he could work with me. i agreed. his
    help has brought back many painful memories, and we are dealing with them together.
    he says things to improve my self-esteem. he believes in me and wants me to have
    a better future. he even hinted he''d like to be part of that future. his tenderness
    is incredible, and i find myself melting into his arms. now for the bad part:
    he told me that he spent 25 years in prison. although he is no longer the same
    person who committed those crimes, he was incarcerated once for rape and two years
    later for sexual assault. he now has erectile dysfunction, so i know he couldn''t
    do it again, even if he wanted to. i am starting to care for him a lot, but at
    the same time i''m scared of him. i don''t believe he would ever harm me, but
    ever since he told me the truth, i''ve been having nightmares about someone chasing
    me and trying to hurt me. should i stop seeing him? he does everything he can
    to reassure me that he won''t hurt me, and i want to believe him. please help.

    "kirk" and i have been together for more than three years, and last year he asked
    me to marry him. we have yet to set a date because we don''t want to rush into
    anything. i am 25; he''s 24. ninety-five percent of the time, we are happy. he
    calls out of the blue just to say he loves me. i write him love letters. he blows
    me kisses from across the room. my only concern is, we have had two fights that
    became mildly physical, and i''m afraid of repeating my parents'' mistakes. when
    i was a child, dad hit mom more than once. (my brother and i would hide in our
    rooms and hear her scream for us.) they finally divorced when i was in high school.
    my last fight with kirk was over a pregnancy scare. i had missed a couple of birth
    control pills, so i got the "morning-after" pill and took it. kirk refused to
    believe i had taken it. at the breakfast table, he became furious and smashed
    the tv remote control. it''s not the first time he''s thrown a temper tantrum.
    when he does, i always cringe. then he gets over it and i clean up the mess. but
    this time, i was mad, too, so i smashed my cereal bowl on the floor. well, it
    bounced and landed on his head! blood poured everywhere. he was so frightened
    he called 911. they wanted to arrest me, but kirk told them it was an accident.
    i didn''t mean to hit him, although my mom says maybe i did. kirk took all his
    things with him when he went to the hospital for stitches, then went to stay at
    his brother''s. the next day when i saw him, he hugged me and said, "you have
    a sick baby to take care of." he said he had been in so much pain he hadn''t had
    time to get mad. i feel terrible. if he''d done this to me, i would never see
    him again. (although once he did hit my head against the car window while he was
    driving.) in my heart i know i didn''t mean to hurt him, but nobody believes me.
    i should not have lost my temper. i know if i control myself and don''t get mad
    over petty things, he will also be ok. if he decides we should keep seeing each
    other, do you think it will work? -- lost my temper in chula vista'

    i''m a 27-year-old guy, and i''m involved with an older woman i''ll call carmen.
    carmen has three daughters from previous relationships. i have no authority over
    them, and they show me no respect. even though they talk rudely to me, i''m supposed
    to accept it. carmen demands everything be done her way, and i have no voice in
    anything that happens in my home. carmen''s youngest daughter, "talia," recently
    got a kitten. we agreed it would not be kept in the house because i am allergic
    to cats. i make my living as a singer, and if i can''t breathe, i can''t earn
    money to support us. i''ve explained this to all the girls, but no one seems to
    care as long as they get what they want. talia whines, and the cat is inside.
    what should i do? -- desperate in indiana'

    i broke my engagement to my fiancee, "shirley," recently. i am sad, but i know
    it''s better to have ended it now, rather than have a divorce down the road. the
    engagement ring and wedding bands are back in my possession, and i would like
    to "dispose" of them because they are painful reminders of our failed relationship.
    how can i salvage some of my investment? it is no longer possible to return them
    to the jeweler, and a pawn shop will never give me their full value. any suggestions?

    my husband and i have been married almost three years. like every marriage, we''ve
    had our ups and downs. my husband constantly accuses me of having an affair. i''ve
    never given him any reason not to trust me, nor have i been with anybody else
    since we married. he constantly asks, "where did you go? who did you go with?
    what time did you go? how long were you there?" i stay home all day so he won''t
    give me the third degree. on fridays when he gets paid, he picks a fight so he
    can leave. he doesn''t return until sunday, and then half his cash is gone. during
    the week, he stays up until the wee hours of the morning, even though he has to
    get up at 5 a.m. for work. also, i have found pieces of burnt foil in his belongings,
    along with a straw. once i even found drugs. i pack my husband a good lunch every
    day. i''m loving and have his dinner ready when he comes home. i don''t go anywhere

    my daughter, "jessica," is a terrific teenager. she works hard in school and has
    a nice group of friends. she and her friends have never been involved with alcohol
    or drugs, largely because they have stayed away from the crowd that uses them.
    next year, jessica is going off to college where beer and pot will be everywhere.
    i am concerned because, unbeknownst to jessica, there is alcoholism in our family.
    my father started drinking heavily after we kids were grown and gone. he was never
    abusive or falling-down drunk, but he was alcohol-dependent. he''d fall asleep
    in his chair by 7 every night. mother finally confronted him, and although he
    never sought professional help, he managed to get his problem under control. i''m
    not proud our family wasn''t more up-front about dad''s drinking. mom and dad
    both wanted to cope with it privately, and although mom confided in my brothers
    and me, it has remained a family secret. i know alcoholism may be genetic, and
    i am torn about disclosing my father''s history to jessica. i want her to know
    she may have reason to be particularly careful about drinking, but i don''t want
    to spoil her relationship with, or her respect for, her grandfather. what should
    i do? -- worried mom, oakland, calif.'

    my 13-year-old daughter, "karen," met a boy on the internet. i guess she felt
    she needed to talk to him because she called him on the telephone. unfortunately,
    he lives in spain, and she ran up an $1,100 phone bill. karen had no idea it cost
    that much to call him, and of course she didn''t ask for my permission. i grounded
    karen until she works off the debt, which will probably take six months. i also
    took away her phone and internet privileges and made her quit the school volleyball
    team. karen has adhd, so we''ve had some problems with her in the past. i don''t
    want to overreact and make her rebel or run away like i did when i was her age.

    my husband took his own life nearly 30 years ago. i have been in individual and
    group therapy for 20 years and in 12-step recovery for 15. not surprisingly, my
    problems affected my kids when they were young. they both live far away now. my
    daughter, "margie," is in therapy and recovery. my son is in denial. five years
    ago, margie asked her brother and me not to contact her for a while. she said
    she needed time and space to work on specific issues independently. i have friends
    who have done this with good long-term results, so it made sense to me. recently
    a few friends have urged me to write margie and tell her i miss her. others, including
    my aa friends, praise my respect for her process and say they wish they had received
    similar support from their families. i regard contacting her as disrespectful,

    i am a part-time server at a nice restaurant. recently a woman came in to have
    lunch with "vic," the owner. vic paid for the woman''s lunch and tipped me before

    she handed me a small tip. i hesitated but felt she''d be offended if i refused.
    two weeks later, this woman saw me at my other job and said vic told her he had
    tipped me. she then demanded her money back. i was horrified. i didn''t have cash
    on me so i told her to stop by the restaurant later in the week. i said i would
    apologize to vic, but she said she didn''t want him to know. i feel awful about
