    i''m a 22-year-old woman. when i was 11, my parents divorced. because mom was
    an alcoholic and a drug addict, my brother and i lived with our dad. i know a
    16-year-old boy named "sam" who is experiencing the same thing. his parents are
    divorced and he lives with his mother. she, her boyfriend and his friends smoke
    a lot of weed in the home and are stoned most of the time. sam has tried to talk
    to her about it, but she only yells that he can''t tell her what to do because
    he''s the kid, not the mother. he wants to move out, but his brother is only 9,
    and sam can''t support them both. sam has thought about telling his father what
    his mother is doing, but he''s afraid his mother will never forgive him. abby,

    my husband, "ted," and i have been happily married for five years. he gets along
    well with my family, but refuses to have contact with his own mother. ted''s mother
    is an alcoholic and generally abusive because of it. (she even hit me once.) she
    has stolen money from his savings account, and once we had to bail her out of
    jail. she is also a pathological liar and has caused the whole family a lot of
    grief. ted''s father left her, remarried, and is doing well. now and then, ted''s
    mother writes him and sends little gifts to show she''s thinking about him. she
    says she has changed. ted doesn''t want to give her the chance to hurt him again,

    when we were in our 20s, my best friend "debbie" was an actress in several movies
    and television shows. then she married, started a family and retired to be a stay-at-home
    mom. however, when she was just starting out and was desperate for work, she had
    a nude role in a movie. it wasn''t pornography, but it was graphic. her sons are
    now in high school and college. last week, i was searching for her new e-mail
    address and did a web search on the internet. i found several pictures of her
    that had been taken on the movie set -- and those pictures could definitely be
    called pornographic. i doubt if debbie knows they exist, much less have been posted
    on the internet. she is not much of a net surfer, but her sons are. should i tell

    my husband passed away four years ago. about two years ago, a dear friend, "hugh,"
    lost his wife. hugh and i went on two dates and hit it off. he told me he loved
    me and always had. i have a deep affection for him. nine months after his wife
    passed away, we moved in together and have been living together ever since. hugh
    and i are happy, but i would like to be married. at first, he asked me to give
    him time to deal with his loss. a year ago, he confessed that he had made a deathbed
    promise to his late wife that he would not marry again. he wants to see her in
    the afterlife. christianity says there is no marriage in heaven. even though we
    may see loved ones there, we wouldn''t be married. hugh says he''s working on
    getting past this, but i am beginning to think he may never let go of the baggage
    he''s carrying. i want a life with hugh. i am trying to be patient, but i feel
    he has let me down. have you any advice for a forlorn person? -- growing impatient

    "grossed out in florida" asked where older men "get the idea" they can date much
    younger women. for the answer to that question one need only look at the nearest
    movie theater marquee: harrison ford (61) with michelle pfeiffer (45), kristin
    scott thomas (43) or anne heche (34) -- a 16- to 27-year age gap. michael douglas
    (59) with famke janssen (38), frances mcdormand (46) or gwyneth paltrow (31) --
    a 13- to 28-year age gap. steve martin (58) with bonnie hunt (39), jean smart
    (44) or helena bonham carter (37) -- a 14- to 21-year age gap. all of these relationships
    are presented as perfectly normal. also, consider the fuss that was made about
    jack nicholson and diane keaton in "something''s gotta give." how nice it was
    to see contemporaries as a love interest! in reality, diane is nine years younger
    than jack. it''s no wonder these men think that young girls will be interested
    because, hey, if it can happen in the movies, it can happen in real life, right?

    i applaud "sad and disgusted in virginia" for being proactive about protecting
    children from verbal and physical abuse. i was slapped often by my mother in grocery
    stores and parking lots. plenty of people witnessed her tirades; no one would
    intervene. what they couldn''t see was what went on at home behind closed doors.
    she hit me with her high-heeled shoes, pots and pans, even a violin, which shattered
    when it struck my head. no one ever questioned me about my bruises. i was too
    weak, scared and under my abuser''s control to do anything about my situation.
    i endured her beatings until i was 21. they stopped only because i moved to another
    state to attend graduate school. i no longer have a relationship with my mother.
    i have often blamed myself for not speaking up about my own abuse. i remember

    twenty years ago -- at the age of 3 -- my son was diagnosed with kidney disease.
    his illness worsened, his kidneys failed, he endured dialysis. then he received
    a kidney transplant -- the miracle of life. my son''s first transplant was at
    age 6, and it gave him three great years. his second transplant was at 9. both
    donors were deceased. the second kidney took him all the way through high school.
    he started dialysis again when he entered college, and the wait began for another
    kidney. no one in our family could donate because we all had the wrong blood type.
    then, one day, science and research came through for us again. a technique was
    perfected that allows a person to donate an organ of a different blood type from
    the recipient. my son was one of the first to benefit from the technique. we were
    able to use my wife''s kidney, a near-perfect match except for her blood type.
    it worked! that was three years ago. my son is healthier than he has been in 20
    years and has just graduated from college. how can we ever thank the two families
    who gave my son the gift of life that allowed him to survive long enough for my
    wife''s kidney to be used? we will celebrate my son''s life with thousands of
    other transplant recipients at the national kidney foundation u.s. transplant
    games this summer. together we will pay tribute to the doctors and donors who
    made this happen as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of transplantation, a
    therapy that has saved more than 100,000 lives. -- alan mittleman, national kidney

    of me taken when i was about 15. at the time, i was trying to look sexy: tight
    jeans, unbuttoned shirt, come-hither look -- but now it''s just embarrassing.
    i laughed with him at the silly photo and forgot about it. this week, ben brought
    home a "surprise" -- a life-sized painting of me based on that old photo. now
    he wants to hang it in our home. i told him i didn''t find it flattering and would
    be uncomfortable having that slutty painting of me displayed anywhere. he said
    i''m too sensitive, and no one will know it''s me. (what an insult!) then ben
    played his trump card: he bought the painting for himself, not for me, and thus
    it''s his decision whether (and where) he chooses to hang it in his house. i am

    easter is coming. many families still purchase live rabbits as pets for their

    what they are getting themselves into. as a result, too many of these poor creatures
    end up in animal shelters, and children learn that pets are disposable. before
    getting rabbits, people should consider: (1) are they willing to make a 7- to
    10-year commitment? that is the average lifespan of a rabbit. (2) what will happen

    in their house for a rabbit cage? (4) are they willing to pay to get it spayed/neutered
    and provide vet care? (5) do they know that most rabbits hate to be held? will
    their child accept that? (6) are they willing to ensure that children under 7
    won''t pick up the rabbit without supervision? rabbits are fragile; their legs
    or spine will break if accidentally dropped. (7) can they provide three hours

    want the rabbit, too? a rabbit should be a family pet. if people have questions

    my friends and i are in eighth grade. this is our last year together. we''ll be
    going to different high schools in the fall. "allie," "betty," "carol," "diane,"
    "emma," "fran," "gail," "hannah," "ivy" and i sit together at lunch. the table
    is pretty crowded, so we took a vote that two people should leave the circle.
    allie and betty had to move to another table. after lunch, carol said she didn''t
    think it was fair to vote friends out of the circle. i realized she was right,
    so i passed a note to diane about not wanting to break up the circle and what
    carol had said. i said we should all sit at the same table again. diane said ok.
    the next day, we all got together at our regular table, but emma and fran got
    into a fight. no one liked anyone anymore. the circle was officially broken. now
    four of the girls sit at the original table; the rest of us sit at a picnic table.
    i''m the only one who''s friends with everybody from the circle. it hurts me to
    see my friends separated at lunch time. will you please print this letter and
    let them know it was wrong to break up the circle? i want my friends to reconsider:

    my husband and i are having a disagreement about something and would like you
    to settle it. when i''m home alone, he sneaks into the house and tiptoes up behind
    me. he has even done it while i''m in the shower, suddenly appearing out of nowhere.
    when i tell him this frightens me, he says i am overly nervous. i say it''s not
    a matter of being nervous. i was raised to be courteous and announce my presence.

    a year ago, my stepdaughter got married and asked my daughter to be in her wedding.

    couldn''t travel there to be fitted for her gown, it was shipped to us. we asked
    if we could go to a national chain store and get the same gown here to make sure
    the size was right. the bride refused. when the gown arrived, it was the wrong
    size. we had to pay for the extensive alterations, as well as the gown. now my

    several months ago i lost my mother to cancer. i am still trying to comfort myself.
    my four children were close to their grandmother, especially my 6-year-old daughter,
    "vicki." vicki comes to me crying and says she misses grandma. when she does,
    i comfort her as best i can, but it''s hard because i haven''t let go and allowed
    myself to have a really good cry. is it ok for vicki to see me cry? i''m afraid
    i won''t be able to stop once i start. and if that happens, how can i comfort
    my daughter? every week, i take fresh flowers to the cemetery. vicki always wants
    to go with me, but i''ve taken her only twice. do you think it might help her
    to go with me? i''m worried that taking her to the cemetery will only reopen the
    wound of losing her grandma. -- wanting to grieve'

    my children attend a local elementary school here in dallas. they are in kindergarten
    and second grade. other parents have told me about a practice that occurs in third
    grade at our school. if a child''s desk is not properly organized (to the teacher''s
    specifications), the teacher does a "desk dump" in front of the class and orders
    the child to put the items back using the "proper organization." i don''t think
    public humiliation is an appropriate teaching technique. and i seriously doubt
    that the children learn anything more than fear of their teacher. fortunately,

    the evening with me -- having dinner, planning, doing homework, etc. occasionally

    know his plans. she constantly tries to make us feel guilty about not spending

    in our office we often send cards and gifts as a group to anyone who has a birthday,
    new baby, etc. usually everyone signs the cards. we are a big department, so there
    are a lot of names. what is the etiquette on group sympathy cards? should everyone
    sign it, or is that too flippant? should it read, "your friends in the department?"?

    my best friend, "sheila," was recently married, and i was a bridesmaid. about
    two months before the wedding, sheila called to say that the junior bridesmaid
    dress she had selected for one of her attendants was too small –- size 8 for a
    girl who was size 12. sheila asked if there was anything i could do to make the
    dress fit because it was too late to order another one. after a lot of work and
    many long hours over a four-week period, i finished the alterations. neither sheila
    nor the junior bridesmaid paid me for the work, and i thought that was because
    i said i''d do it as a favor to sheila. a few days before the wedding, i was still
    deciding what to give her as a wedding gift, but everyone i asked said that altering
    the dress should be enough. well, sheila didn''t see it that way. on her wedding
    night, she called me several times demanding a gift of money! she said i had been
    disrespectful by not giving her a gift. even after her honeymoon, she called again
    to talk about the money. was i wrong not to give her a separate wedding gift?

    my 80-year-old mother lives alone in a small apartment and maintains a fairly
    independent lifestyle with the help of public assistance. i live across the country,

    have a great relationship with him and his adoptive parents. i''ve never regretted

    asks questions, much deeper than one would expect from a 5-year-old, and expresses
    some confusion. he understands that he came from my tummy but that he has his
    own parents. he knows that he is part of my family as well as his own, and when
    he met my mom, he chose to call her "grandma." what billy doesn''t understand
    is why all his friends came from their mommy''s tummies and he couldn''t come
    from his adoptive mom''s tummy. he also often expresses a desire for a brother
    or sister. i am now engaged to be married to a wonderful man. we just found out
    that i am pregnant. i''d like billy to be the ring bearer at my wedding, but i
    don''t want to mislead anyone by introducing him and his family as "close friends

    married to another woman i''ll call sherene. he has not lived with or slept with
    sherene for 30 years. when i bring up the subject of marriage, edgar always says
    he is going to get a divorce. after 22 years with me, it hasn''t happened. abby,
    if edgar dropped dead tomorrow, sherene would be recognized as his wife -– not

    i have been living with "neal" for three years. neal works from home for only
    a few hours a day. he pays all the bills, so i don''t have a problem with his
    choice of work. what bothers me is i have no time to myself because he''s always
    there. neal demands so much attention from me that i can''t even read a recipe
    without him interrupting. i am not a wimp, but neal has the more dominant personality
    and controls what we do with our time. at least it feels that way to me. but according
    to neal, i don''t give him enough time. since i moved in, i have not achieved
    any personal goals or even given as much love and attention to others as i used
    to. i rarely pursue interests of my own and almost never spend time doing things
    i want to do. i feel like i''m losing my individuality. i love neal, and i''m
    not even sure he is the problem. i think i need to be more assertive about where
    my life is going. is there a book or support group for someone like me? am i just
    depressed? obviously i don''t have the drive to pursue my own interests. i will

    appears to be headed for many brief relationships if he has the preconception

    i left my husband after 20 years of marriage, asked for a divorce and got it.
    my ex was very upset, but did not fight it. our two older children are in college.
    the youngest is 16 and a high school senior. she was very upset at the time we
    separated. although i was the one who wanted the divorce, i realized later that
    it had not been a wise decision, and i asked my ex to come back. he agreed. the
    problem is our 16-year-old. she does not think it''s a good idea. she doesn''t
    say why, just that she "feels that way." she had a good relationship with both
    of us, but she does not want us to get back together. she doesn''t come to church
    with us, and she doesn''t like to see us together. i don''t know how to deal with
    this. any advice? -- confused in maryland'

    my boyfriend of nine months, "brent," was killed in a car accident. i have been
    a mess ever since. i dropped out of school and have no job. i do not live with
    my parents, and i no longer have the love of my life. one of brent''s best friends,
    "doug," and i recently spent two intimate nights together. it was special and
    felt right. doug has had a girlfriend for almost two years. they are expecting
    a baby any day now. he has told me he wants to break up with her and move away
    with me because he feels he should look after me. another of brent''s good friends,
    "brian," is a player. brian doesn''t respect women, but since he and i became
    close after the accident, he respects and watches out for me, too. one thing led
    to another with brian, too, and we have done the deed many times. i have feelings
    for both doug and brian, even though they don''t come close to what i felt for

    i am upset about what my mother-in-law did at my wedding last saturday. this is
    my second marriage and my husband, "sherman''s," first. instead of eloping, we
    chose to have a wedding with family, close friends and only my children, who are
    8 and 11. no other children were invited. we made arrangements at a hotel to provide
    supervised activities and snacks for the children. one of my brothers refused
    to attend because he was unwilling to leave his son with someone he didn''t know.
    my other brother went to great lengths to find a sitter of his own choosing. my
    mother-in-law informed us before the wedding that she wanted to bring her daughter''s
    3- and 4-year-old children. we clearly stated that no children other than my own
    were invited and offered to include her grandchildren at the hotel with the other
    children. she declined the offer and assured us that the little ones would be
    taken care of by a friend of their father''s. fifteen minutes before the ceremony,
    those little ones were out of control, waving plastic machine guns and running
    wild through the church. i asked that they be driven to the hotel immediately.
    they disappeared, and i assumed that''s where they went. when the ceremony began,
    they were in the second row with sherman''s parents. during the 30-minute service,
    they sat on various people''s laps, kicked the back of the pew in front of them,
    shrieked, and loudly asked questions about what was going on. they turned an intimate,
    private affair into a circus. now my two brothers and sisters-in-law won''t speak
    to me because they think i favored sherman''s family over my own. other guests
    with older and better-behaved children are also upset because i told them only
    my children would be there. i haven''t slept a full night since because of this.
    today sherman confronted his mother. she said her grandchildren are family, and
    she wasn''t about to exclude them, and if my brothers were upset, they should
    have brought their children, too. i am at my wit''s end. sherman fully supports
    me in this. i don''t want a fractured relationship with sherman''s mother, but
    i have never had anyone disregard my wishes with such effortless aplomb in my
    life. i no longer want to visit her, spend holidays with her or do anything with
    her at all. it bothers me that she has set a precedent of what she says, goes.
    what can i reasonably do other than pack up my family and move to another state
    or country? -- mad as a hornet in n.c.'

    "shot in the heart''s" story is a familiar one. let me tell you what happened
    to my sister-in-law''s nephew, "nicky." when nicky was 17, his girlfriend, "andi,"
    was 15. andi''s parents liked nicky and were fully aware of her sexual relationship
    with him. andi was still 15 when nicky turned 18. then andi got pregnant. when
    she told her parents the news (she felt she had very cool parents and could tell
    them anything), they filed charges against nicky because he was now an adult.
    the outcome? the ruling of the court was that for the rest of nicky''s life, no
    matter where he moves, he will be required by law to register as a sex offender.
    (he is also forbidden to have any contact with andi, whose parents made her get
    an abortion.) the law enforcement agency that nicky registers with is legally
    required to send out fliers letting nicky''s new neighbors know that a sex offender
    has moved into their area. this will follow nicky for the rest of his life. everywhere
    he goes, people will regard him as a sick and evil person. they won''t bother
    to find out the specifics of what occurred. "shot in the heart" needs to consider

    my dad died two years ago, leaving my mother alone after 49 years of a wonderful
    marriage. my sister and i helped mom move into an assisted-living facility where
    she has adjusted as well as can be expected. my dad worked hard, saved well, and
    left mom with no financial concerns. our dilemma is that mom, a very trusting
    person, has now befriended a man who is a known con artist. this man has been
    in severe financial trouble for more than 20 years and has asked mom for a large
    sum of money, which she agreed to give him. he also informed her that this sum
    of money may not be enough to resolve his problems. abby, this man has been caught
    in several lies, but mom insists she''s doing the right thing. we are certain
    he intends to drain mom of 50 years of hard work and savings. how can we help
    her? we need to help her understand this man''s true motives. we both love her
    dearly. -- worried sick in alabama'

    for years now, my dad''s health has slowly deteriorated. he has good days when
    he kind of knows what''s going on, and bad days when his whole world is off balance.
    recently he suffered some mini-strokes, and last september the doctor diagnosed
    him with alzheimer''s. i was there when dad was diagnosed. you could see the look
    of relief on his face to finally have a name for what was going on inside him.
    he told the doctor, "well, at least now i know i''m not going crazy" because it
    was a medical condition he could comprehend. the problem is his siblings. they
    get angry at mom when she tells the doctor how dad is at home and accuse her of
    exaggerating. they get upset with us for not letting dad drive, even though he
    doesn''t see well and has been known to get lost. they have even gone behind our
    backs and told dad he does not have alzheimer''s, which only compounds the problem.
    some of dad''s siblings see him only once a week at church. they all insist he
    is "fine" and blame mom for his lack of "spirit." one aunt, in particular, is
    cold and nasty toward mom. poor mom has a hard enough time being caregiver to
    a man who doesn''t always recognize us and can''t remember names. there are times
    when dad runs to the neighbors saying, "people are in the house trying to steal
    things." mom, who has always been a strong woman, cries almost daily. she does
    not deserve nor need the aggravation that dad''s siblings are causing. she loves
    dad and wants, as we do, only the best for him. how can i handle this? mom wanted
    to include dad''s family in what is going on with him, but all it''s done is bring
    heartache and sadness. -- they''re not helping'

    my boyfriend, "andy," is a marine. when he was fighting in iraq, he sent me e-mails
    saying how much he missed me and couldn''t wait to be with me. when andy came
    home, he was a completely different person! we got pregnant soon after, and he
    seemed ok with it at first. then he was sent back to iraq. he started fighting
    with me long-distance and telling me to get an abortion, but he said he still
    loved me. about two months ago, he stopped telling me he loves me. he never talks
    about our baby that''s due soon. he has never helped financially. andy is now
    back from iraq, and he says he loves me but has "a lot to work out." he''s so
    distant now. what should i do? please help. -- in love and hurting'

    i work for a major airline and saw something today that was very disturbing but
    more common than you might think. a relative of an 87-year-old lady with alzheimer''s
    disease put her on a plane with a card pinned to her clothes with her name and
    information written on it. it was not a nonstop flight, and we were asked to make
    sure she didn''t get off the plane before her final destination. the traveler
    obviously had no idea where she was going or what to do. abby, as you know, things
    can happen when people fly. weather and mechanical problems can leave passengers
    stranded away from home or their destination. can you imagine how that would affect
    an already scared and confused lady? airline personnel are not baby sitters. people
    with this mental capacity should be escorted when traveling. between elderly travelers

    i am a junior in high school and have participated in the souper bowl of caring
    since it started at spring valley presbyterian church in columbia, s.c. from putting
    $1 in the big soup pot at church when i was 3, to taking calls from other young
    people reporting their group''s collections on super bowl sunday, i have seen
    firsthand that young people can make a difference. would you please ask your readers
    to join this youth-led effort to help the less fortunate? the movement got a huge
    boost when you spread the word a few years ago. to participate, people simply
    give $1 each for the needy as they leave worship the weekend of the feb. 1 game.
    youth group members holding large soup pots stand at sanctuary exits to receive
    the donations. best of all, each group (schools do it, too) sends every dollar
    it collects directly to a local charity it chooses. even though the money collected
    is sent directly to each charity, we ask participating groups to report their
    totals on game day so the national impact can be measured. access www.souperbowl.org
    or call (800) 358-7687 for instructions, to request free posters and to report
    totals. (we would love for the total to be announced during the game, but we need
    help to make that happen!) abby, an aggregate of more than $20 million has been
    collected to help needy people since the souper bowl of caring began in our church
    youth group. this year 28 pro coaches have signed on. thank you for encouraging
    young people, and all people, to make a difference. god bless. -- shelley long,

    has said hurtful things from time to time, like, "our marriage is over," "i want
    a divorce," etc. he also refuses to do household repairs. (he moved into my house.)

    buy a new house. abby, i am terrified of going further into debt with him. we''ve
    been to marriage counseling. we were told the worst thing we could do is to buy
    another house together. we would only move our problems to a new location. yesterday
    was the last straw. he said, "you may look young, but you''re old. no one is ever
    going to want you for anything except what they can get out of you!" i have not
    confided this to a single soul. i''m too ashamed that the man i married could
    think something so cruel -- let alone say it. jerry always apologizes, but i can''t
    seem to get past this. when i think about what he said, i start to cry. (he can''t
    understand why i''m not able to "get over it" and jump into bed.) abby, i look

    my husband and i have worked long and hard on our yard to make it a beautiful,
    peaceful retreat. last year, we had it landscaped and added a lovely pond with
    koi fish and a small waterfall. we both work and time is limited, so we enjoy
    it mostly in the mornings with our coffee. the problem is since we added the pond,
    our yard has become a "public park"! almost every day we go outside and find people
    in our yard -- even strangers -- asking questions about the cost of the renovation.
    we finally put up a fence, but folks have climbed it to look at the waterfall
    they could hear from the front walk. how can we stop this? i want to put up a
    sign that says, "if you weren''t invited, you''re not welcome." the clincher came
    yesterday, when i went out early with my coffee to find a neighbor occupying my

    and a girl -- ages 8 and 11. burt works in sales. i am a designer and run my business
    out of our home, so that i can be here when the children come home from school.
    for the last couple of years, burt has complained that the "spice" has gone out
    of our marriage. he did some internet research and found a swingers group in our
    community. at first, he only did some chatting online, but now he wants us to
    go to one of their parties. i told him i''m against it, but he insists. the idea
    of exposing myself to strangers is mortifying. but the more i tell him no, the
    more insistent he becomes. should i agree to it to save our marriage? -- wavering

    my mother is suffering from an alzheimer''s-like dementia, and her personality
    has changed greatly. mother has gone from being a conscientious and polite woman
    -- most of my high school friends called her "june cleaver" -- to losing the checks
    and balances that prevent her from saying whatever comes to mind. specifically,
    my mother can be very unpredictable in restaurants. she has, several times, while
    the hostess has been walking up to the table, demanded in a loud voice that they
    "turn off the damn music!" no matter what we say to her, she does not understand
    that this behavior isn''t acceptable. what can we say to people in a situation

    my daughter is a tall, thin, blond-haired, blue-eyed bully. she calls other girls
    at school fat and ugly to the point of bringing them to tears. the mothers complain
    to the teacher, who calls me and her father. today her teacher told me that a
    schoolmate asked my daughter for a piece of candy, and she replied, "you don''t
    need it. you''re fat enough already." the kicker, abby -- my daughter is only
    5! i don''t know where she learns these things. we have always taught our children
    never to call names or pick on others because they are different. she has certainly
    never heard things like that at home. her older brother is a sweet, well-mannered
    child who has never given us a moment''s trouble. before this, i always thought
    that bullies were from homes where they were neglected or abused in some way,
    so they took it out on other kids. but my daughter comes from a happy, loving
    family, and i can''t for the life of me figure out how she can be so mean-spirited
    at such a young age. i didn''t think kids that age were even aware of their appearance,
    but my daughter will tell you in a heartbeat that she''s "beautiful" or "skinny."

    in my years of work answering a company telephone, i have discovered that saying,

    to relay the information to the call recipient. "may i ask who is calling" has
    a note of nosiness to it, and does not imply that the need to know is just to
    relay the name. before i learned this trick, people would sometimes take offense

    about 40 years ago, a grand old new york department store opened a suburban branch

    suggesting counseling. of course, herbert will have none of that. he says we can''t

    a few years ago, at christmas time, i helped santa claus by filling in for him
    at a small shopping mall. instead of the usual long lines of children who are
    processed on and off santa''s lap like an assembly line in large shopping malls,
    i was able to enjoy spontaneous visits with teenagers and adults as well as tots
    bearing lists of toys. a pair of teenage boys ran up, gave me a hug and a grin,
    and asked me to bring them motorcycles. after a brief chat, they walked away chuckling
    -- pleased with their visit with st. nick. a bright and happy 3 1/2-year-old girl
    sat on my lap and chattered constantly, asking questions and answering mine. finally,
    she looked me in the eye and said, "i thought you were fake. you''re real!" her
    doubts removed, i''m sure she had a magical christmas. a young father, all alone,
    paid the elf photographer for one picture and said, "i don''t have custody of
    my children, but want to show them a picture of you and me shaking hands." when
    he received the finished photo, he looked at it and mouthed, "thank you," and
    departed. however, my most emotional visit was with three teenage girls. the first
    one giggled and asked me for a sports car. the second topped her by asking for
    a mansion. the last girl whispered in my ear, "i''d like a job for my father."
    as they walked away, the last one refused to answer her friends'' question, "what
    did you ask santa for?" her profound request was between her and santa, who was
    overcome with emotion. i truly believe that her father found a job because, you

    don''t most of us enjoy stories from our parents'' and grandparents'' past? during
    the last few years of my mother''s life, she was confined to her home and then
    to a nursing home. i urged her to write her memories of childhood in a lined notebook
    that i provided. on one hand, those stories needed to be preserved for my children,
    and on the other, it gave my mother a project to work on and keep her mind active.
    she enjoyed it and filled about 20 pages. she described her childhood days, then
    continued through courtship, marriage, my birth, struggles through the great depression,
    and the building of a new home. it gave us a clear view of times gone by -- a
    family treasure in her handwriting. my reason for writing this is to remind your
    readers to ask those old-timers to write their memories before those treasured
    stories pass into oblivion. -- robert h., badin, n.c.'

    were useless to her. she has tried "hinting" that she doesn''t need things like
    that, but they refuse to listen. it would be so much more helpful if they would
    instead cook a meal for mama, or stop by a restaurant and bring her a meal when
    they visit. she isn''t up to cooking, and a gift like that would not wind up packed
    away for the next generation. when they visit, they usually stop by a restaurant
    and eat, but they never stop to consider that mama would love a meal, too. i try
    to cook for her as often as i can, but i have a disabled child at home who is
    in and out of the hospital. when i do cook, i package meals for her that she can
    microwave and enjoy. what a help it would be if my siblings would do this. why
    don''t people stop and take into consideration how a person lives and what his
    or her needs are before buying a gift? thanks for letting me vent. -- christine

    i''ve been dating a wonderful man for several months. we have a great relationship,
    and i know i''m fortunate to have him. his family is very kind and warm. they
    have always welcomed me into their home by inviting me to family events, holidays,
    etc. the challenge is, his family is from eastern europe. he came to the united
    states at a relatively young age, and his english is perfect. however, his parents
    and grandparents do not speak or understand english very well. i want so much
    to sit down and have a conversation with his mom, but i can''t. i''m trying to
    learn their language, but their alphabet is different from ours. also, i am dyslexic.
    while i will not give up on learning their language, it will certainly not happen
    overnight. i can''t afford classes to get professional help in learning the language,
    and my boyfriend can''t always be right by my side to translate. i''m dying to
    be able to tell his mother that the dinner was good, or her blouse is pretty.

    until now, i had a perfect life with a wonderful husband and a great 16-year-old

    always treated him as if he were. my ex-husband remarried and now has three daughters.
    i never hid this from my son. but now, my ex-husband''s daughters have "found"

    actually talked to his birth father on a couple of occasions. mike now treats

    with his "sisters," but i did not know about the conversations with his father.

    my father went to prison five years ago, and my mother has been taking care of

    some shocking information. mom has been going on dates with a clergy member who
    has been sending her text messages saying things like "i can''t stop thinking
    about you," etc. i also found out she has a profile on a couple of internet dating
    sites and has been coming home later than usual after going out "for drinks with
    friends" after work. when i confronted her, she first denied it, then got caught
    in a lie. she refuses to accept responsibility, insisting "it wasn''t a date,"
    although this man expressed romantic feelings for her. my father knows nothing
    about this while he languishes in a cell for what could be another five or six
    years. should i tell him? i also do not know if i should confront this clergyman
    because i find his actions despicable. how can i explain to my mother that what
    she''s doing is wrong? when i try to talk to her in a mature way, she says things

    about a year ago, my fiance, "dave," and i befriended a neighbor of his i''ll
    call jane. we didn''t know her very well. i tried to talk with her once when she
    joined us outside, but her focus was solely on her husband. not long afterward
    they separated, and jane was devastated. their marriage had been filled with financial,
    emotional and infidelity problems, but she loved him. jane gravitated to dave
    and me for emotional support. she needed cash, so i hired her to watch my girls
    twice a week so dave and i could go out. things were fine for a while, but then
    she began showing up all the time. on nights that i worked, jane would hang out
    at dave''s. finally, we both told her it made me uncomfortable, and she seemed
    to get the message. she found another part-time job, became involved with church,
    and began reading books about boundaries, emotional strength and spirituality.
    i was happy for her. then jane began confiding in dave. she''d tell him about
    the men she was meeting at work, exposing herself to them for money, sex for money,
    intimate relations with married men, wanting to get tattoos in places i won''t
    mention. when dave told me, he made me promise not to say anything to jane because
    he didn''t want problems in the neighborhood. i ended my social relationship with
    her. she still baby-sits for me because it''s hard finding help for my disabled
    girls. but our relationship is strictly business. i would like to tell jane how
    angry i am that she discussed her sexual behavior with my fiance while pretending
    to be my friend. then again, i have the situation at home and i do need time off.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    the holiday season has begun and most people have started planning for family
    feasts, gifts, home decorating and travel. not everyone, however, will be able
    to leave home, enjoy a holiday trip, or be with family and friends. for many people
    who are frail, elderly, sick and have disabilities, the holidays mean staying
    home without the festivities enjoyed by others. may i offer some simple suggestions
    to brighten the holidays for our homebound neighbors? 1. one way to literally
    make the holidays brighter is to help replace burned-out lightbulbs inside and
    outside their homes. this can be extremely helpful for someone who has difficulty
    standing or turning bulbs in light sockets. (the same is also true for replacing
    batteries in smoke detectors.) 2. help with holiday decorations. because putting
    up decorations can be difficult for frail elderly people, a little assistance
    with lights and ornaments that usually remain in boxes could brighten their holidays.
    3. give a holiday gift of nonperishable food items. for elderly individuals on
    fixed incomes, a special gift of jam, instant hot cereals, fruit or a selection
    of teas or coffee could be a "luxury." 4. check to see if the heat inside the
    home is adequate and that precautions have been taken to ensure that faucets are
    working during sub-zero temperatures. 5. a lap robe or quilt can be a welcomed
    gift for someone whose home is not well-insulated or heated when the temperature
    falls. many elderly people find it difficult to ask for something, valuing their
    self-reliance and independence, even if it means ignoring a need. if you think
    a homebound neighbor could use assistance or a special gift, please reach out
    and make the effort to help. -- linda mason, visiting nurse association of texas'

    what is the official dear abby position on screaming children in restaurants?
    my husband took my mother and me to a family restaurant to celebrate our birthdays,
    and two children from different families were screaming their lungs out. one of
    them, a child about 3, alternately screamed, begged, whined and threw tantrums
    the whole time. the other child was much younger, but seemed to be keying off
    the other child. abby, it was horrible! our server could hardly hear us to take
    our order -- and i''m not exaggerating. we could not enjoy our dinner because
    of the piercing shrieks coming from both sides of the restaurant. had i done that
    when i was little, my mother would have taken me outside, if only to make the
    atmosphere more pleasant for the other diners. the family with the older child
    ignored his behavior. this seems to happen more and more often, i''ve noticed.
    the family finally left, but both my husband and i had splitting headaches from
    the noise. what, if anything, could we have done? the other diners were as uncomfortable
    as we were. -- wish i''d had earplugs, decatur, ala.'

    she doesn''t want to quit is she read somewhere that quitting "cold turkey" increases
    your chance of complications from smoking. she refuses to believe she''s hurting
    anyone. would you please tell her that not only is it inconsiderate and selfish

    my husband, "kirk," accompanied me overseas for an extended military tour. he
    has been an excellent care provider for my two children, ages 2 and 7. he does
    all kinds of activities with them that i cannot because of my work schedule. i
    recently found out that kirk has been having an affair and stealing from me to
    fund his activities. initially, he lied about the whole thing in counseling, but
    when cornered he confessed. kirk has since promised to end the affair, and i have
    taken precautions with my finances. we have agreed to stay together until we get
    back to the states (about six months), and then we will file for divorce. my friends
    think that i''m crazy to keep him around, but there is no better person here to
    take care of our children -- and changing my hours is not an option. we never

    this year it''s our turn to have thanksgiving dinner for my parents, my two brothers
    and their families at our home. my parents and brothers all live in the same city,
    about three hours from my family. my father recently had major surgery. he''s
    recovering at home and can''t drive. my mother can drive. however, she drinks
    a little, although she has never caused an accident. abby, i''d still like to
    host thanksgiving dinner at our home. we don''t have a spare bedroom, but i don''t
    think it would be a problem to make sleeping arrangements for my parents, my brothers
    and their families. all together, there would only be eight adults, a preschooler,
    a 6-year-old, 8-year-old twins and two teenagers in our house -– and it would
    be only for two nights. (members of our families always stay with relatives when
    they travel, so a motel is out.) my wife thinks it would make more sense (even
    though she enjoys cooking) if we stayed in a motel close to my parents'' home
    this year and treated everyone to thanksgiving dinner in a restaurant close by.
    how can i convince her that my plan to have everyone at our home will work? --

    i have a friend, "stacy," who has a mental illness and is on public assistance.
    i try to help her out by giving her rides to various places. yesterday i gave
    her a ride to the store. she knew i was low on diapers, so she shoplifted some
    for me. i didn''t know what to do because stacy is emotionally unstable and can
    get verbally abusive when confronted, and i had the baby with me so i accepted
    the diapers and drove her home. i am uncomfortable using the diapers and would
    like to return them, but i don''t know how to go about doing so without getting
    stacy into trouble, because she doesn''t know that what she is doing is wrong.

    my widowed father recently married a woman i''ll call "millie." the wedding was
    held at millie''s home. of the 20 or so guests in attendance, the only single
    adult was my younger sister, "kim." the ceremony was beautiful, the food was delicious,
    and everyone seemed to be enjoyed themselves when, out of nowhere, three of millie''s
    friends asked for everyone''s attention. they then announced that instead of the
    bride tossing her bouquet, they had decided to just present it to kim! most of
    the guests laughed, and kim played along, but i could tell she was upset. these
    friends went on to say something like, "don''t worry, kim, you won''t be single
    forever -- your turn will come someday!" abby, my sister is a brilliant, beautiful,
    very successful attorney in a well-known law firm in a large city. but because
    she doesn''t have a man in her life, she was "singled" out and teased in front
    of a group comprised mostly of strangers. she held it together through the party,
    but wept openly to me afterward. she felt humiliated, and worse than that, like
    some kind of failure. as it turns out, it was millie''s idea to give kim the bouquet
    and make it a "funny" display. kim was incredibly hurt and no longer wants much
    to do with our new stepmother. i don''t want to get in the middle, but i feel

    my 22-year-old niece, "brittany," married her boyfriend of many years last month
    in a lavish production of a wedding financed entirely by her father (my brother).
    on the invitations, it was mentioned that their home was fully furnished, so in
    lieu of gifts, they''d appreciate money for their honeymoon to the dominican republic.
    most family members generously complied and chipped in $300 to $500 each. my widowed
    grandmother, who lived on a fixed income, even sent them $50. four days after
    their return from the honeymoon, brittany threw her husband of two weeks out of
    the house and moved in with her new boyfriend, whom she''d first met when he "entertained"
    at her bachelorette party three weeks prior. to say we are all surprised is putting
    it mildly. no one has heard from brittany since, and no explanation was offered.
    my mother recently got her on the phone, and brittany quickly ended the conversation
    by claiming that all the money had been "spent" and that her now ex-husband had
    any funds that remained. (we know this can''t be true because the distraught groom
    recently approached my brother and asked him to pay for the annulment.) doesn''t
    etiquette dictate that brittany return all gifts -- including cash -- as the marriage
    ended just days after the checks cleared the bank? is this why there''s a 12-month

    my parents called me a worthless daughter. they even went so far as to inform
    me i was no longer welcome in their home. after that, i became depressed and made

    my older sister, "katie," has three children -- an adopted son, a foster son and
    a biological son -- all under the age of 3. katie and her husband took in their
    foster son, "richie," only because he''s the biological brother of their adopted
    son. they didn''t know if they''d get to keep richie or not, so katie closed herself
    off to him emotionally. during the year and a half that she has had richie, he
    has become, in essence, an "invisible" child. she shows him no kindness, no positive
    attention and certainly no love. i love richie. it makes my heart ache to see
    him emotionally neglected. it also causes me distress to see that katie seems
    blind to the way she behaves toward him. the rest of our family sees what''s happening,
    but no one seems to know how to handle the situation. my husband and i have been
    unable to have children of our own, and we currently keep richie every weekend.
    we have considered taking him in ourselves, and if possible, adopting him. he
    loves us as much as we love him. my question is, should we (our family) stand
    together and try to convince katie to open her eyes and change her ways, or would

    he said he wants to be in the film industry. i asked what he planned to do if
    it didn''t work out. he responded, "go into the family business." i asked what
    business justin''s family was in. he responded that his family didn''t have a
    business, that he had meant our family business. then he said, by the way, he
    would change how we were running it to produce more cash by slowing down our expansion
    plans. i was speechless. my daughter told us later that she and justin had never
    discussed it before. my wife and i are in our 40s. we don''t plan on retiring
    soon, or letting any of our own kids take over running the business. my wife says

    i am a 35-year-old lesbian. i have a wonderful partner and we have an amazing
    10-year-old son. my problem is, we seem to offend people when we refer to ourselves
    as a "family." i have had people correct me, sometimes even suggesting that i
    refer to my family as "my friend and my son" or "my friend and her son" (depending
    on who they think is the biological mother). abby, this woman is more than my
    friend. she''s my partner, my life mate, my support and my co-parent. we try to
    be sensitive to people''s beliefs and not call each other "wife" or refer to our
    union as a "marriage," but how far do we have to take this? we are a family. our
    son calls us both "mom." we aren''t "in your face" with our lifestyle, but to
    deny our partnership is to deny our son his family. we generally refer to each
    other as "my partner," which i think is an inoffensive term, but even that can
    send some people into a snit. how should we handle people who want to redefine
    us? why is it so hard for them to acknowledge that, untraditional though we may
    be, we are a family? -- trying not to offend in texas'

    my grandson, "curtis," will be 5 this year. i have promised him since he was old
    enough to walk and talk that i''d take him to disney world for his fifth birthday.
    it has always been taken for granted that we''d include my youngest daughter and
    her best friend, "trish." at the time we discussed the trip, trish''s parents
    had good jobs. however, fast-forward several years and things have changed. both
    of them have lost their jobs. their home was foreclosed on, and they now live
    in a rental house and struggle to make ends meet. i am also having a hard time
    financially, but i have been diligent in saving what i can to take curtis to that
    magical place he has always dreamed of. we plan to fly there and stay on the grounds,
    which can be quite expensive. would it be rude to ask that trish''s parents at
    least pay for her ticket into the theme park? we never discussed who would be
    paying. my family thinks it would be rude, and would jeopardize trish''s chances
    of coming with us. when people invite my kids anywhere, i have always offered
    to repay the family for the expenses involved. i don''t want to hurt or offend

    today was my son''s fourth birthday. i gave him a party. some of the children
    who came were dropped off by their parents. one of the boys started grabbing my
    son''s gifts and opening them. but the real trouble began when my mother grabbed
    him by the arm and pulled him roughly away. this happened twice before my husband
    could make it across the room and tell mother to stop it immediately. i am very
    worried about my mother. she''s 64 and seems to be losing her mind. her displays
    of nervous and strange behavior are increasing. her mother, my grandmother, was
    a paranoid schizophrenic, and i have often believed my mother might have some
    type of psychiatric condition. how do i tell her she needs to talk to someone
    before this escalates further? i allow her to baby-sit my son for short stints
    only, and now i''m questioning any further "alone time" at all for them. she calls
    me constantly, insisting that she wants to see him. is there an easy way to tell
    your own mother that you think she is close to "losing it"? if i''m going to gear

    my husband, "george," and i have been married 22 years. we have four teenagers.
    five years ago, we decided to leave the west coast and move back east to be closer
    to family. george moved first. the children and i stayed behind until our house
    was sold and the school year had ended. we commuted as often as possible, but
    commuter marriages are never easy. during our separation, george had an affair
    with a woman, and she became pregnant. a paternity test confirmed that he is the
    father. george was very remorseful, and we decided to save our marriage. he promised
    he would never see the woman again, nor would he have a relationship with the
    child, who is now 4. (he pays child support through the woman''s attorney.) recently,
    she has begun breaking her part of the agreement by sending photos of the boy,
    with occasional letters about his progress. abby, if our marriage is to survive

    i have been reading your column for many years, but i have never before been tempted
    to write to you until now. about a year ago we moved into a new home in a nice
    neighborhood. one of the last homes sold happens to be on our street. yesterday,
    a flier was stuck in our mailbox. i don''t know how many of them were distributed,
    but there are 200 homes in our subdivision. the flier announced an open house.
    it listed all the usual stuff -- time and place -- with the following statement:
    "if you would like to bless us with a gift, we would greatly appreciate a gift
    card from one of the following stores: home depot, wal-mart, lowe''s, best buy,
    sears or jcpenney." we were flabbergasted to get such an "invitation" from someone
    we don''t even know. what do you think about it, and how would you handle this?

    i got the surprise of my life three years ago when my husband of 28 years asked
    for a divorce. not long after the divorce became final, i ran into "tim," an old
    high school classmate, and fell head over heels for him. he stays at my house
    every weekend and is on his own during the week. last week i used tim''s e-mail
    account to send an e-mail. when i pulled up the account, i discovered that for
    the past three years, the man i''m in love with has been seeing five other women!
    he reminded me that he has been a bachelor for 20 years and has many female acquaintances.
    he sees nothing wrong with going out with them, and sees one of them once a week.
    i am extremely uncomfortable knowing that tim has been seeing other women and
    wasn''t up-front with me about it. i was under the impression that we had an exclusive
    relationship. are my feelings unreasonable? -- shocked in ohio'

    please settle a disagreement my wife, "angela," and i are having. we heard from
    some friends that angela''s nephew was being married. angela saw her nephew on
    a couple of occasions, and he never once mentioned that he was even engaged. the
    wedding was held in july. we did not receive an invitation. now an announcement
    has arrived in the mail stating that they are married. angela has heard through
    the grapevine that the bride is registered for wedding gifts at a local department
    store. i say we should send them a card since we were neither notified of the
    engagement nor invited to the wedding. angela is very upset over this because

    at a friend''s wedding last weekend, my best friend''s husband propositioned me.

    like that. i told him it would never happen, but if i ever considered it, it certainly
    wouldn''t be with my best friend''s husband. he said that that''s why i was the

    over the last 25 years, americans have done a great deal to prevent fires in their
    homes. home fire fatalities in the united states have dropped 50 percent since
    the 1970s, thanks in part to public awareness and education. technology such as
    smoke alarms has helped, too -- by alerting home occupants when fires start and
    giving them time to escape. however, while most categories of fire continue to
    decline, one category is on the upswing: candle fires. that is why this year,
    during fire prevention week, the national fire protection association is focusing
    its efforts on offering important candle safety information to dear abby readers.
    some facts to consider about candle fires: more candles are now being sold, and
    the result has been more fires. candles have become such popular decorative accessories
    that during the last decade in the u.s., fires caused by candles have tripled
    in number to 18,000 per year. forty percent of these fires begin in the bedroom,
    causing one-quarter of the deaths associated with candles! (december has almost
    twice the number of home candle fires as any other month.) how can you safely
    enjoy candles at home? extinguish them when leaving the room or before going to
    sleep. make sure all candles are placed in sturdy holders, large enough to collect
    dripping wax. keep them out of reach of children or pets. and use a flashlight
    -- not a candle -- for emergency lighting. thank you, abby, for reminding your
    readers to be responsible when using candles. i hope everyone who reads this will
    take the necessary steps to guard against fire in their homes. -- james m. shannon,
    president, national fire protection association'

    another name, that there is no such person -- she no longer exists. wouldn''t
    his ex-wife still be a co-owner of the account since it is a joint account? obviously,

    change after marriage. this has become a giant bone of contention, and it hurts

    understand." i say, open up a new account and start over with me. he becomes angry
    every time i mention it and says it makes him more determined to keep the account!
    frankly, eric is starting to make me feel like i''m crazy for caring. am i being
    unreasonable? or is the writing on the wall telling me he still enjoys seeing
    their names together? -- hurt in bloomington, ind.'

    i was married to "richard," the father of my child, 12 years ago. i was pregnant
    and having severe mood swings when i left him, and eventually we divorced. we
    had no further contact until a couple of months ago. our son told him some things
    about the way we now live, and the way my current husband has treated us. richard
    was not pleased, to say the least. he offered his second home in another state
    to us, because he rarely uses it. he also gave me the impression that he still
    has feelings for me. our son, like any child, wants his parents to be back together.

    an hour -- i saw not one sign of verbal or visual contact between them. the reason?
    the younger woman was on a hands-free cell phone, talking office talk from the
    moment their orders were placed. the older woman sat eating her meal, clearly
    with little interest and no animation. when they were finished eating, the younger
    one paid the server, and then gestured "let''s leave" by pointing toward the exit.
    she got up quickly, motioning for her mother to hurry. i found the episode upsetting,
    and i hope she reads this: life is so short. take your mom to lunch whenever you
    can, but talk with her, laugh with her, connect with her. show her the respect

    i live in the northeast and don''t get to see them as often as we''d like. a year
    before dad got sick, my parents seemed to go through a positive mid-life crisis.
    they lost weight, found new friends, partied every night. they rarely saw us or
    talked with us because they were busy. they seemed to be enjoying the next stage
    of their life together. if i complained, they said they were "having a life now"
    because raising kids had taken all their time. my brother recently confided to
    me my parents were sowing their wild oats then because dad knew he was getting
    sick. he knew he was on borrowed time and he''d have to sell his business and
    give up driving. he told no one but mother. i am extremely upset with my parents.
    while they were going out every night, we could have shared some time with him
    before it was too late. although i cry every time i see dad, i feel i maybe don''t
    have as much sympathy as i should. knowing he kept a secret like that has altered
    our relationship. when mom calls and complains that she has no life and has to
    do everything by herself, i want to say she did it to herself. my siblings and
    i are not selfish. we would have done everything for our father. please tell me
    if i''m being overly emotional. didn''t i have the right to know? am i entitled
    to be angry, or should i let it go? -- confused daughter in philly'

    i am married, have a daughter i love and a fulfilling job as a teacher. but when
    it comes to socializing at parties and small gatherings, i have a problem. my
    husband loves to socialize, which is good because his job is in sales. i''m the
    opposite. i have a hard time making small talk and become very uncomfortable in
    social situations. i guess you could call me an introvert. i sense that people
    pick up on my discomfort, which makes them uncomfortable, too. sometimes i simply
    have nothing at all to say to these people. abby, i''m tired of feeling like an
    odd duck at these kinds of events. i know i owe it to my husband to be supportive
    when he has to entertain. a while back, you offered a booklet i think might help
    me, but for the life of me, i can''t find that column. how can i get the booklet?

    i live upstairs in a fourplex. my across-the-hall neighbor is a pleasant single
    woman who loves animals. she has two cats and two ferrets. the problem, to put
    it bluntly, is they stink. i don''t think she keeps up with their hygiene needs.
    the stench drifts from inside her unit into our common hallway, and too often,
    into my apartment -- even with the door closed. i roll up a large towel and place
    it at the bottom of my front door to help with the smell while i''m home. but
    when i leave in the mornings to go to work, obviously i can''t do that. when i
    return home at night, the smell has crept under my door. it''s very embarrassing
    when i have guests. i''m forever burning incense, but it doesn''t help. it only
    makes the air thicker, especially in the hall, which has no air conditioning.
    i have tolerated this for a couple of years and i don''t know if i should speak
    with her or the landlord. how can i broach the subject and still keep harmony

    my wife insists on baking chocolate chip cookies as a "thank you" for an older
    couple next door who have been very nice to us -– giving gifts to our 2-year-old
    daughter and generally being great neighbors. the husband is overweight and diabetic.
    i say it''s insensitive -– even cruel -– to give food like that to someone we
    assume is trying –- or should be trying –- to stay away from it. i say we should
    just send a thank-you note instead. my wife insists it''s the "thought" that counts,
    and that they sometimes entertain grandkids who can eat them, or they can give
    the cookies away if they don''t want them. this question has come up before with

    we moved into a very quiet neighborhood a year ago. then our neighbor, a divorced
    father of a 3-year-old boy, reconciled with his wife and they moved back in. when
    the father had visitation we allowed our son to go over there once while my husband
    and i got some chores done. nothing bad happened. however, now that the boy -–
    who is the same age as our son -– is a full-time resident, we have become aware
    of some not-nice behavior on his part. he has tried to get our son to eat dog
    doo-doo, and has told our boy to be mean to our dogs, which of course, our son
    would never do. he is always looking through our chain link fence and teasing
    our son. i get a bad vibe from him. we are people who don''t like conflict. is
    there anything you can suggest so that we can go out into our back yard and again

    i have a close friend i''ll call "june," who was married to a man named "jeff"
    who lied to her. he was an elder in the church for several years and is retired
    from the military. it all started when jeff had a stroke. he told june he needed
    to set up a bank account for her in case he had another one, but he kept putting
    it off. so june went on the internet to research some information to make it happen,
    and got the shock of her life. she learned that jeff is still married to his previous
    wife. she contacted the pastor and they confronted him; jeff denied everything.
    (june has since gotten an annulment.) the house belongs to june, but jeff refuses
    to leave. he stalks her. everywhere she goes, he shows up. he keeps telling her
    she''s going to have him in her life whether she likes it or not. she tries to
    ignore him, but he constantly approaches and confronts her. now the pastor is
    trying to get them back together. when she says she wants nothing to do with him,
    the pastor tells him she''s being "uncooperative." june took the legal route.
    a judge has ordered jeff to pay off june''s student loans, which he hasn''t done.
    he still hasn''t moved out of the house, and his boss thinks they''re still married.

    there is this woman, "lucy," he claims is only a friend, who lives about 70 miles
    from us. i started getting suspicious when she called him one night when the two
    of us were in bed. (he immediately hung up the phone.) he gets up after i go to
    sleep to talk to her via the internet. i caught them once doing things they shouldn''t
    have been doing. when i confronted them and threatened to leave, duncan begged
    me not to go and said their friendship was "harmless." i forgave him, but now
    lucy calls him at 3:30 every morning, and he gets out of bed to talk. i heard
    him tell her that he''d be taking a business trip in a few days and would call
    her back. now, abby, i warned my husband i would leave if i found out they had
    any more contact. he doesn''t know i know about her calling and that he''s going
    to contact her. should i listen to my intuition? how should i handle this? --

    my sister needs help. her husband, "dale," who has been in the reserve for 15
    years, is being deployed to kuwait next month, and she''s a mess. she went to
    the emergency room this morning because she thought she was having a heart attack.
    it was an anxiety attack. one minute she''s distraught because he''s leaving;
    the next she wants to divorce him. "andrea" was always proud of dale''s service.
    she has happily bragged that she''s an officer''s wife, about the pay, the retirement
    that will come their way, and the travel deals they have enjoyed staying at army
    properties all over the country. until now, she has supported the action in iraq
    and afghanistan. now, however, she has kicked dale out of the house because she
    believes he has chosen the army over their family. she says he won''t be allowed
    to call or e-mail her or their two kids while he''s on active duty. andrea refuses
    any suggestion of support services through the army because she doesn''t think
    the session will be kept confidential. although i want to support her, i believe
    she''s denying dale the support he deserves. it infuriates me that she has been
    in favor of the military action as long as it involved other people''s families
    and not her own. andrea and dale have been married 20 years. she has never lived
    alone, nor does she have the means to support herself. she has been seeing a therapist
    for the past few months for depression, but her next session isn''t for a few
    weeks. how can i help? what can anyone else do to help? -- concerned sister'

    my husband gave me a beautiful diamond and sapphire ring for our anniversary.
    because it was too large, i took it to a jeweler who has worked on many pieces
    for me. after looking at the ring, he asked me where it came from. i told him
    it was a gift from my husband. when i asked the jeweler why he asked, he informed
    me that the sapphire was synthetic and the "diamonds" were, in fact, cubic zirconia.
    i was shocked, and now i don''t know what to do. i''m not certain whether or not
    to tell my husband. i don''t want him to think i don''t like the ring, in case
    he knew what he was purchasing. it is beautiful, and i will love wearing it regardless.

    over the past few years, i have noticed an increased number of restaurants putting

    i am a physician and mother who goes to substantial lengths to avoid subjecting
    my 6-year-old son, "brandon," to secondhand smoke. my husband and i feel so strongly
    about it that we let our nanny, "edith," go because she persisted in smoking around
    brandon. (she had stated on her employment application that she was a nonsmoker.)
    brandon recently returned from a week-long visit with my in-laws, "connie" and
    "fred," out of state. they are both aware of my concerns regarding secondhand
    smoke. when they visit us, connie smokes outside or sneaks smokes in the bathroom.
    before we sent brandon to visit, i explicitly asked connie not to smoke indoors
    during his visit, and she agreed. when brandon got home, i was shocked to hear
    that while he was there -- and without conferring with my husband or me -- connie
    and fred had invited our ex-nanny to spend part of the week with them. according
    to brandon, edith and connie smoked in the kitchen and living room in his presence.
    i am hurt that my in-laws refused to take our health concerns to heart. my husband
    wants to keep the peace, but suggests we not allow brandon any more unsupervised
    visits with his grandparents. i feel my husband should discuss their lack of candor
    in agreeing not to expose brandon to cigarette smoke, and not following through.
    it also seems odd that they''d invite an employee we had terminated to visit without
    clearing it with my husband or me. what do you think? -- smoking mad in illinois'

    my mother has a family heirloom that has been handed down several generations
    within my deceased father''s family. over the years, she has apparently told each
    family member he or she could have it upon her passing -- or so they say. about
    four years ago, i was talking to mom long-distance, and she asked what i''d like
    to have upon her passing. i replied, "nothing, except some of the things i have
    given you over the years -- and i wouldn''t mind having the heirloom." she said
    everyone wanted it, but because i had always shown an interest in family history
    and no one else in the family had, i should be the one to have it. she said dad
    would have liked that. i said, "if you want me to have it, please write my name
    on it, because i won''t get it otherwise." she said she didn''t feel that our
    family was "that way." some time later, i was visiting and noticed my name was
    permanently and discreetly written on the heirloom. mom now says that the family
    is in an uproar, and she does not remember writing my name! the family is claiming
    i either wrote my name on the heirloom myself, or coerced her into doing it. (not
    true!) mother has serious health problems, one being memory-related. she refuses
    to tell other family members that she made up her mind long ago and wrote the
    name herself. i think she knows she wrote it, but wants to avoid family strife,
    and that''s why she won''t acknowledge her actions -- which means i''m taking
    the brunt of this. i feel mom was of sound mind when she made her decision, so
    what''s the problem? i''m not a dishonest person, and it upsets me immensely to
    be falsely accused when i''m guilty of nothing more than saying i wanted the heirloom.

    if "hurt" allows those co-workers of hers to get away with what they said to her,
    she can be sure they''ll do it again to some other woman. although the writer
    feels she would have "nothing to gain" by confronting them, i do not agree. i
    was raped at 15, and finally -- at age 50 -- i was able to say to the person what
    i needed to say. i have felt a whole lot better ever since that day. in my opinion,
    she should go to her supervisor and tell him or her that she would like to have
    a meeting with everyone who was involved. she should ask that the supervisor be
    present. the following issues should be presented: (1) the question she was asked
    was rude, and embarrassed both her and her fiance that night. (2) how would they
    have felt if she had made a comment concerning their anatomy in public and in
    such a manner? (3) if they were in her situation, how would they have felt if
    their wives, mothers or sisters were treated in the same way? they need to be
    told that what was said was not cute or clever, not a joke, and above all, will
    not be tolerated by her again. in reality it was sexual harassment, and will be
    handled as such if it recurs. there are courts of law that take care of such situations.
    and those clowns need to know that she will go to one if they pull that stunt
    again. -- free at last, austin, texas'

    i recently received a modest inheritance. my husband and i are about 10 years
    from retiring. the money is just enough to put away for a secure retirement, not
    enough for a lavish lifestyle. the problem is my mother-in-law, "vera." she is
    70, healthy and active. she manages very well in her paid-for home. vera has now
    begun looking at assisted-living communities that, for a hefty monthly rent, provide
    chef-prepared meals in a dining room, activities and transportation. she''s assuming
    that my husband and i will pay this rent, since we are now "wealthy" in her estimation.
    abby, if we take on this responsibility, the money will be spent by the time we
    retire, and vera will still need to pay her rent. i never discussed this inheritance
    with my mother-in-law. it came from my side of the family and is really not her
    business. we didn''t brag or start making showy purchases. my husband feels as
    i do about putting it aside for retirement, but we''re both stumped about how
    to handle his mom. have you any suggestions? -- "the heiress" in upstate n.y.'

    a few years ago, i lost a treasured stuffed animal from my childhood. i told my
    husband about it, and how sad it made me. being the caring, thoughtful person
    he is, he went on ebay to see if he could find one like it. he thought he had
    located it, but wanted to be absolutely sure, so he sent my mom the link. she
    informed him it wasn''t the same bear and convinced him not to buy it, but still
    he told me about it. the next time we went to visit my mother, she said she had
    a "surprise" for me. as we were packing to go home, she presented the surprise:
    the same teddy bear my husband had shown her. he was very upset, but did not confront
    her. my husband has also mentioned that he feels my mother doesn''t like him.
    would it be ok to ask her why she bought the bear after talking him out of it?

    needed medication. the meds were complicated and had to be administered twice
    a day. the cats vomited profusely several times, and went to the bathroom every

    and even consulted the vet at one point. when my neighbors returned, they paid
    the boy $30 for the four days he worked and didn''t offer me one nickel. worse,
    they paid him in front of me! i badly needed the money, but even if i didn''t,

    "had discussed it." when i asked him to put it on paper, he agreed. his attorney
    drafted a document for him to sign. after it had laid around the house for more

    to call the attorney myself. well, you guessed it. i was told the papers had been
    executed. when i confronted girard he admitted he had lied and promised to have
    the will done over. when i looked at the document he had signed, i saw that girard
    was giving me 90 days to get out of the house after his death. i was upset, so

    my son "vince''s" mother-in-law, "dotty," has never had a driver''s license because
    she never learned how to parallel park. she only has a learner''s permit. after
    vince married her daughter, "lynn," dotty was stopped by the police for a traffic
    violation. she gave them her daughter''s name and address and told them she had
    "forgotten her wallet." the point went on lynn''s record and her car insurance
    shot up $150. during the latest incident, someone hit dotty''s car in a parking
    lot. dotty again pretended she was lynn. the police were summoned and demanded
    dotty''s driver''s license. when she handed them her learner''s permit, her car
    was hauled away and now she has to appear in court for driving without a license
    with no licensed driver in the car. when vince was contacted by the insurance
    company, he told them the whole story. dotty thought lynn would just forget the
    incident and she''d be home free. she still drives her car every day. to get even
    with vince for ratting her out, dotty refused to give my grandson his medicine
    while she baby-sat him. how should my daughter-in-law deal with this nasty woman?

    our loving, compassionate daughter was stricken with a mental illness in her sophomore
    year of college. my husband and i have experienced much pain -- but not nearly
    as much as our daughter has. she is much improved due to medication and her incredible
    bravery, but she is never free from the delusions and hallucinations. it is such
    a cruel disease because the thoughts and senses you have come to trust in your
    first 20 years of life suddenly play tricks on you. while it is no longer politically
    correct to joke about gender, race, sexual orientation and intelligence, we still
    encounter people regularly who refer to someone in conversation as "crazy," "certifiable,"
    "retarded" or "schizo." this happens even with people who know what we''ve been
    through. i don''t want to be rude, but i want people to know that mental problems

    my 44-year-old brother-in-law, "bryce," still lives at home. he has never dated,
    nor has he had any kind of adult relationship in his life. he is extremely affectionate
    toward children, especially males. he buys gifts for the neighborhood kids, and
    they all think the world of him. my in-laws say bryce is just a big kid and harmless.
    i think his behavior is abnormal. last week, i came home early from work. when
    i came through the door, i surprised bryce saying goodbye to my 10-year-old son.
    bryce was rubbing his hands up and down my son''s arms and saying, "goodbye, sweetheart.
    i love you." when he saw me, bryce immediately stopped. he seemed caught off guard
    and embarrassed, and left quickly. my husband was in another part of the house
    and didn''t see or hear his brother and our son by the back door. i expressed
    my concern to my husband later, after our son had gone to bed. i told him i was
    uncomfortable about the idea of his brother being alone with our son. my husband
    dismissed the whole thing, saying bryce is harmless. my gut tells me otherwise.

    my parents have always assumed that if anything happened to me and my husband,
    they would be named guardians of our two children, ages 7 and 4 months. we have,
    however, decided to name our best friends, "gabrielle" and "frank." when we asked
    them to be guardians, they said they would be honored. gabby and frank have two
    kids, 7 and 11 months. we rarely differ on parenting techniques, and they have
    always treated our children like their own. we chose to go outside the family
    because half our siblings live far away and we don''t want the children moved.
    the siblings who have remained in our hometown all have problems with drugs and/or
    alcohol. mother is a wonderful grandmother, but she suffers from frequent migraines
    and has a touch of emphysema. a weekend with both grandchildren completely exhausts
    her. dad loves the kids but has little patience with them. he also drinks too
    much, and that''s not the environment i want my kids raised in. because we''re
    going outside the family, we will include strict visitation rights for my parents.
    mom will be very upset when we tell her she won''t get custody and will probably
    stop speaking to me. would it be ok not to tell her and let her find out if and
    when the will is read? if not, how can i tell her without destroying our relationship?

    my boyfriend, "arnold," and i have lived together two years. during the four years
    that we''ve known each other, we have had only five or six really bad, screaming,
    door-slamming, crying fights about relatively important subjects like children
    and money. arnold told me yesterday morning that he would be playing soccer with
    friends after work, and to expect him home a little later than usual. well, when
    he wasn''t home by 10:30 p.m., i panicked because he''s usually home from games
    by 7. his cell phone was turned off, so i called a co-worker to try to locate
    him. ten minutes later arnold walked in the door. when he heard i had called a
    co-worker trying to locate him, he got very angry. he raised his voice, called
    me "psycho," and said i had no right to know where he was every minute. abby,
    we live in a bad neighborhood where innocent people getting shot, run over and
    killed isn''t unusual. i am very upset because i have no idea why he got so angry.
    we have since made up, but i''m still hurting and feel his reaction was undeserved.
