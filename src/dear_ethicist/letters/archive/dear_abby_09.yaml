    when i first heard about topless swimsuits for girls, i thought it was just a
    lot of talk, but yesterday i actually saw one for sale in a store! if women would
    consider wearing a topless swimsuit in public, we have reached a new low in our
    civilization -- even lower than the decadence that preceded the fall of the roman
    empire. topless swimsuits? have we lost all sense of decency? who cares if we

    my husband says that i snore, but i know i don''t. one thing i know for certain

    my problem is a husband who thinks he''s funny. i had a very nice dinner party
    at home the other night and was especially proud of the way everything turned
    out. well, when the guests were leaving, my husband said, "come back soon because
    the only time i get a decent meal around here is when we have company." everybody
    laughed, but i wanted to crawl into a hole. he said that once before and it got
    a big laugh, so he pulled it again. in the first place, abby, it''s not true.
    i pride myself on always feeding my family very well. i told him later i didn''t

    4. scorch the beans (use an expendable pot). 5. burn the potatoes. 6. intrude
    on their private talks. 7. bone up on some polite (?), classical insults, including
    references to moochers and deadbeats. 8. get rough bathroom tissue. 9. put out
    a short supply of cheap (very cheap) towels and washrags. 10. lock the good sheets
    and towels away or "store" at a good friend''s for a few days. 11. don''t wash
    the dishes; next mealtime exclaim, "oh my, the dishes aren''t washed. you ladies
    will have to help me do them!" 12. have the tvs out for repair. 13. don''t pay
    to put those sorry bums up at a motel -- let them rent their own rooms. if these
    steps don''t get rid of them -- fumigate! -- a mean old ex-farmer from kansas'

    can you stand one more letter about crazy wedding nights? my mother and dad have
    repeated this story often. dad had relied on close friends to reserve the bridal
    suite in the mallory -- a lovely old residential hotel in portland, ore. as it
    turned out, the friends didn''t think it was necessary to make reservations, so
    they didn''t bother. well, as luck would have it, there was a plumbers'' convention
    in town that week and, needless to say, every hotel was filled to capacity. the
    manager of the mallory was gracious enough to find them a place to sleep for the
    night. the first "room" they were offered was a closet under the stairs with no
    ventilation. the second option was the women''s lounge located on the main floor
    of the hotel right off the lobby. they chose the lounge. the management brought
    in two roll-away beds and hung a "closed" sign on the door. dad said he unscrewed
    hundreds of light bulbs from around the vanity mirrors because he couldn''t find
    the light switch to turn them off. my folks said there were about eight toilets
    in the room, and they never used the same one twice. all night long women were
    knocking on their door -- trying to get in to use the restroom. they didn''t get
    much sleep, but they had a lot of laughs and made the best of the situation. their
    union produced five children, and lasted until mother''s death six months ago
    -- one month short of their 44th anniversary. dad''s name is leo kacena. mother''s
    name was june. i''m their daughter. -- joy springer, bellflower, calif.'

    to answer that question. i hope someone who has will write and let me know. the
    answer would be helpful to many readers -- as well as to this columnist." i was
    not prepared for the volume of mail i received. some excerpts: from ashland, ky.:
    "don''t say, ''oh, my god! what happened to your child''s face?'' brace yourself,
    then find something positive to say about the baby''s bright eyes, lovely head
    of hair or the outfit the child is wearing. but don''t mention the child''s abnormality."
    from lake jackson, texas: "do not ignore the child. a child with a deformity can
    see, hear and feel. bend down and say, "hi ya, little fella -- what''s your name?''
    ask his mother if you may pick him up and hold him. the child will feel accepted
    and the mother will bless you a hundred times in her prayers." from yakima, wash.:
    "don''t try to comfort his mother with the ''news'' that they are doing remarkable
    things with reconstructive surgery these days. be assured that the parents are
    well aware of what can be done; they also know that it must be done in stages
    as the child grows. and the child has probably had many surgeries already." from
    shelby, ohio: "treat him as you would treat a normal 2-year-old -- not ignoring
    the deformity, but not making an issue of it, either. this is not hypocritical;
    neither is it acceptance of it. it puts it in its proper perspective. forget the
    ''i''m so sorry'' stuff. the mother knows you''re sorry -- and so is she!" from
    east hartford, conn.: "look behind the disfigurement and see the child beneath
    still too young to know that he is different. (he will learn all too soon.) treat
    him as you would treat any other 2-year-old. what you say to the mother doesn''t
    matter. if she wants to bring up the subject of the child''s problem, she will,
    but she would much rather have him treated as a human being than discussed as
    a medical problem. his disfigurement probably can be cured in time, but the damage
    to him personally from being treated as less than human may not be." from dallas:
    "god gives these special children something that others will never develop in
    a lifetime. we''ve suffered more from prejudice and ignorant remarks than the
    difficulty of coping with our child''s multiple handicaps. one stranger actually
    said, ''how brave of you to take him out in public instead of putting him away
    in some institution with people of his own kind.''" from long island: "thank you,

    letters. the public needs to be educated."'

    when i read the letter in your column about calling 35- and 44-year-olds "our
    children," i had to smile. our children are 26, 27, 29, 30 and 34, and we still
    call them "the kids." my husband is 59 and i am 50, and his parents always refer
    to us as "the kids." but what really strikes me as being funny is hearing the
    grandparents who are 76 and 75 years old call my in-laws "the kids." don''t you
    just love it, abby? it sounds so loving and youthful. -- marjorie gellat'

    four years ago our son, "al," got his girlfriend, "tara," pregnant. tara was 15
    and al was 18 at the time. a week after our grandson was born, tara''s parents
    kicked her out of their house, so we took her and the baby into our home where
    we lived happily as a family. as time went on, tara got pregnant again -- also
    from our son -- and when she became of age to marry without her parents'' consent,
    she and al selected a date in september (1990). al was a college student living
    at our home with tara and the babies. one month before the wedding, al was killed
    in an auto accident. during his funeral, we treated tara as his widow. tara has
    since reconciled with her parents, and she and her children have moved back with
    them. she is now 19, but she doesn''t date yet because she''s still grieving for
    al. we hope that one day she will have a normal life, but she is not interested
    yet. she attends all of our family functions, birthdays, weddings, christmas,
    easter, mother''s day, etc., just as though she were al''s widow. abby, we feel
    that it may be an embarrassment to her when we introduce her as "tara, the mother
    of our grandchildren." since she and al were never married, she is not technically
    our daughter-in-law. so, how should she be introduced? -- al''s father in georgia'

    my heart went out to "guilty in antigo, wis." -- the smoker who was made to feel
    like a leper by society because she smokes. i am not a smoker, but my mother was.
    i have inhaled my share of secondhand smoke, which, in turn, may have made me
    more tolerant of smokers today, but non-smokers should check their own bad habits
    before looking down their noses at smokers. put me next to a smoker anytime on
    an airplane, in a restaurant or theater, before you put me next to a squawling
    baby or a loud, obnoxious person! most of my friends who smoke go outside to do
    so out of consideration for non-smokers, but how many people do you see actually
    leaving a restaurant or a theater when their child acts up? what i''m saying is,
    we all have habits and/or actions that may annoy others. if smoking is the only
    bad habit "guilty in antigo" has, i''d love to have her over for coffee and a
    cigarette sometime. if she can handle my nail-biting and gossiping, i can handle
    her cigarette-smoking. -- not perfect in westminster, calif.'

    when i was 11, my parents divorced and my mother moved to another state and took

    even on my birthday.) he is now remarried and living a comfortable life with his
    second wife and two stepchildren. how can a father ignore his own blood child?
    i have tried over and over to build some kind of relationship with him, but it
    hasn''t taken hold. i admit, i''ve had some problems growing up. i dropped out
    of high school, and every time i called him he mentioned it, saying i didn''t
    live up to his expectations, so i finally quit calling him. i haven''t called
    him in two years. i am 21 now. should i give up or keep trying? it probably shouldn''t

    my husband and i are taking a two-month vacation, so we advertised in our church

    a female. she works full-time and goes to night classes at our community college.

    wanted $50 a month from us. she was the best choice we had, so we agreed. yesterday
    wanda came over with her parents, and as they were leaving, her mother dropped
    this bomb: "wanda has applied for food stamps -- but you will have to sign a paper

    my problem is my grandmother. (my father''s mother.) every now and then she says

    and thelma''s children. well, anyway, they are thelma''s, but i''m not sure if
    they are wilbur''s or not." my mother has asked my father about his mother''s
    insulting introduction, and he just shrugged it off as if it was nothing. i feel
    that my father should talk to his mother about this slur on our mother''s good
    name since he has no reason to believe that he is not our father. he refuses to
    say anything, because according to him, grandma just means it as a joke. this

    this is a message to those men and women who try to prevent women from entering

    signed up to adopt a child? if not, why not? is it because you don''t want one,
    can''t afford one, or don''t have the time, patience or desire to raise a child?
    what if a woman who was about to enter a family-planning clinic saw your sign,
    then decided not to have an abortion but chose instead to give her baby to you?
    would you accept it? what if the mother belonged to a minority group -- or was
    addicted to drugs, or tested positive for aids? why are you spending your time
    carrying a sign? why aren''t you volunteering to baby-sit a child born to a single
    mother so she can work? why haven''t you opened your door to a pregnant teen-ager
    whose parents have kicked her out when she took your advice and decided not to
    have an abortion? as for the taxpayers who resent paying for abortions, who do
    you think pays for foster care, welfare, social workers and juvenile delinquency?
    the taxpayers. let''s talk about something money can''t buy: love. have you ever

    think anyone has the right to tell others not to have one unless he or she has
    done the things i have mentioned above. so, to those carrying those signs and

    for quite a long time now, when certain situations arise, i ask myself, "what
    would dear abby say?" i would like to address this situation: before i was married,
    i visited my parents (they live nearby) several times a week. now i am married
    -- with new friends, wanting to spend time with my husband and also visit my other
    siblings. this means that my husband and i don''t visit my parents as much. the
    problem? i feel guilty for not spending more time with them. my mother makes comments
    like, "oh, we haven''t seen you for months!" (not true, abby; we see them at least
    twice a month.) i know that we are only as guilty as we make ourselves feel, but
    i would like to know, in dear abby''s opinion, how often is often enough to visit
    parents? they don''t seem to understand that there are other people in my life
    now, and working every day makes me tired at the end of the day and weekends are
    precious. any comments? -- feeling guilty'

    my brother''s son is getting married soon in chicago. the number of family on
    the groom''s side will be limited, as none of us live in chicago. we will have
    to fly in the night before in order to attend the wedding, which is scheduled
    for 2 p.m. we will not be able to leave for home the day of the wedding because
    there are no evening flights. so -- after the airfare, hotel for two nights, meals,
    car rental, etc. -- the wedding will cost each of us well over $700, not including
    the gift. i have just found out that the groom''s family will not be invited to
    the rehearsal dinner, even though we are all from out of town. (there will be
    only six or eight of us.) we are very hurt to think that we will be left alone
    in a hotel in a strange city after all of the effort and expense we will go through
    to attend this wedding. don''t tell us it is our choice to go or not. we know
    that, but his wife would never forgive us if we didn''t come, and besides, we
    really want to be there to see this nephew married. please try to explain why
    my brother and his wife are excluding us from the rehearsal dinner. it can''t
    be the cost -- they can well afford a few more dinners. what do the etiquette

    when is it proper to play cupid? my best friend, "marsha," lost her husband a
    few months ago. he had a massive heart attack with no warning whatsoever. he was
    healthy and athletic. a few years ago, marsha and my cousin, "marc," met at my
    daughter''s christening. it was obvious that there was a strong mutual attraction
    between them, but they were both seeing other people at the time, so nothing came
    of it, and they both eventually married other people. i just learned that marc
    and his wife have split. being a matchmaker is not something i do regularly, but
    i just know that marsha and marc would make a great team. how can i get them together?
    and when would be the proper time? i don''t want marsha to think i''m insensitive,
    but they are both very attractive people, and i don''t want to chance either one
    of them getting involved with someone else before they have a chance to get together.

    and give her away in marriage, and the stepfather has the privilege of dancing
    the first dance with the bride. is this the proper arrangement? i don''t want

    raising nicky to be bilingual. i speak to him in greek, and thus far that''s the
    only language he speaks. he is sure to pick up english from playmates and other

    you recently published a letter signed "''real'' adoptive parent" from a mother
    who was upset by insensitive questions. my wife and i are the parents of three
    girls: one, an adopted korean-born child; another, a biracial child; and one who
    is our daughter by birth. we belong to a local adoptive-parent support group where
    we have heard every imaginable story about encounters with prejudice and insensitivity.
    we have also learned how to handle such questions. when asked what seems to be
    an impertinent question, it is best to assume that there was no harm intended.
    for example, one woman asked if my korean daughter was "mine." when i responded,
    "yes," she asked, "how much did she cost?" when asked, "what happened to her ''real''
    mother?" a good response would be, "i have been married to her for more than 20
    years." when asked, "are they your natural children?" i say, "we don''t use any
    preservatives or artificial ingredients." by answering good-naturedly, and with
    a little humor, parents can communicate two very important lessons to their children:
    how they can one day handle such questions, should the need arise; and at the
    same time demonstrate that since the parents are not embarrassed by their family,
    neither should the chidren be. -- robert klahn, president, rainbow families, toledo,

    this concerns "illinois victim," who was being beaten by a man in her yard, and
    the neighbor who didn''t even call the police. his comment ("i didn''t want to
    get involved") interested me. some time ago, i saw a driver who appeared to be
    drunk cause a serious accident. i immediately called the police to tell them i
    had seen an accident; no one even wanted to take my name or telephone number.
    after 10 calls, one hour later, someone grudgingly took my name and phone number,
    saying, "someone will call you." nobody called until six months later, when i
    got a subpoena through the mail demanding that i appear in court. in large letters
    was this threat: "if you fail to appear in court a warrant will be issued for
    your arrest." abby, in the school where i teach, if a teacher takes a day off,
    the teacher must pay the substitute. i got a substitute for the day of the trial,
    only to be called that morning at 8:30 a.m. and told that the case had been postponed!
    it was too late to cancel the substitute, so i lost that day''s pay. yesterday,
    i got a notice for the next court date, which means i will have to hire another
    substitute. now do you wonder why no one wants to "get involved"? i am being treated
    more like a criminal than a witness! after six months, i hardly remember what
    happened, and because i wanted to be a good citizen, i am now being penalized.

    in any trouble since then. i have noticed that on job applications certain questions
    are asked about "any arrests." i don''t want to lie on a job application and risk
    being caught and later being fired -- or even being sent to jail because of lying
    on the application. so, my question is this: since my arrest was so long ago,
    is there a way for me to have it sealed so that i can put that part of my life
    behind me and not worry about it following me for the rest of my life? please
    don''t print my name or address. -- going straight'

    readers: "rowena l. (brown) edelbrock passed away on june 12, 1991. she left us
    with these thoughts: "''when i quit this mortal shore "''and mosey ''round this
    earth no more "''don''t weep, don''t sigh, don''t grieve, don''t sob; "''i may
    have struck a better job. "''don''t go and buy a large bouquet "''for which you''ll
    find it hard to pay. "''don''t stand around me looking blue; "''i may be better

    it is time to remind your readers that if they wish to display the american flag,
    it must be done with respect. the war is over, but many of the hastily displayed
    flags (by, i''ll call them, born-again patriots) are still outside 24 hours a
    day, all tangled up, wrapped around roof gutters and downspouts, being torn to
    shreds in the wind and rain. you don''t have to be a former boy scout or be knowledgeable
    of the flag code passed by congress in 1942 to understand respect. the american
    flag is to be displayed out of doors from sunrise to sunset "in good weather."
    the flag is displayed at night for special occasions, and preferably spotlighted
    for honor and respect. to me, it seems disrespectful to see flags that were hastily
    mounted in all manner of ways -- even stapled to old mop handles -- still out
    there and forgotten. improvised display of old glory might be dramatic and acceptable
    on the emotion-filled battlefield, but not on permanent homes and businesses.
    abby, can you check out the protocol for displaying the american flag? -- not
    a flag- waver, but i love old glory'

    your "now i''ve heard everything" file: as i was driving along a twin cities freeway,
    i passed a man on a motorcycle doing no less than 60 miles an hour. abby, he had
    a full-grown black labrador dog perched behind him on the passenger seat of the
    motorcycle! the poor animal looked paralyzed with fear. when i called the minnesota

    because the guy wasn''t breaking any laws. abby, how about cruelty to animals?
    that terrified dog could jump or fall from the motorcycle and shatter all four
    legs on the concrete! or, startled motorists could swerve out of control or be
    rear-ended slamming on their brakes, with a dog that size rolling down the pavement.

    i fully agree with your response to the woman of good character in anchorage,
    alaska, who had bought a secondhand car and found $42 in the glove compartment.
    her husband said that inasmuch as they had purchased the car "as is," she should
    keep the $42. you told her to return it. your advice was similar to the story
    told by rabbi simeon, whose students bought a donkey from a merchant to assist
    their teacher in his livelihood of selling flax. his students found a costly pearl
    attached to the neck of the donkey, and they said, "rabbi, you will not have to
    labor any more -- we found this precious gem on the donkey!" rabbi simeon responded,
    "does the seller know of this pearl?" they answered, "no." the sage then said,
    "i bought a donkey, not a pearl." the jewel was returned. as a rabbi concerned
    that people don''t simply tell themselves, "business is business," i am pleased
    you chose to print that woman''s letter. the great writer macaulay wrote: "the

    i have been happily and faithfully married to my husband for 14 years. the problem
    is with our family doctor. recently, my husband thought he had a bladder infection,
    so he went to our doctor, who ran one urine test that turned out negative. then
    the doctor informed my husband that he had a sexually transmitted disease! my
    husband asked if it was possible to have had this "sexually transmitted disease"
    for 14 years -- or was there some other way of getting it? also, wouldn''t it
    be wise to run another test just to make sure? the doctor insisted that his diagnosis
    was correct, then with a smirk he added, "i''m not suggesting that you run home
    and beat your wife, but you obviously got it from her." abby, no wife could be
    more faithful than i. i never even looked at another man in more than 14 years.
    my husband says he believes me, yet he''s been having bad dreams ever since. i
    know i''d be accused of "protesting too much" if i confronted the doctor. this
    is a small town, and it could make matters even worse. besides, i hear that this
    doctor thinks all non-churchgoers (like my husband and myself) are pretty much
    "scum" anyway. what can i do? i''m not taking this lightly. -- bristling in arizona'

    this letter is in response to the letter from "illinois victim," the girl who
    -- while being beaten by her boyfriend at a trailer park -- yelled loudly for
    help from her neighbors, to no avail. a young man also living in a trailer park
    in illinois heard a muffled cry for help. he went outside and saw a man on top
    of a woman with his hands around her neck. he yelled, and the assailant tried
    to escape on a bicycle. but the young man chased him for almost a mile over gravel
    terrain in his bare feet. the man who was caught was wanted by the police for
    previous rapes. when the police asked the young man who caught the alleged rapist
    what his motivation was, he replied (with bruised and bloodied feet), "what if
    that girl had been my sister? i would hope someone else would do the same thing!"
    so, have faith, abby. good people are still out there. he even returned to illinois

    my friend and i read your column and discuss the letters and your replies. we
    usually agree with your answers. now we have a question for you: let''s say that
    "mary" was shopping and ran into a young woman she had known in college -- we''ll
    call her beatrice. beatrice had her 2-year-old son in a stroller, and when mary
    looked at the little boy, she wasn''t prepared for the shock she got. the child''s
    face was terribly deformed and disfigured! what should mary have said -- if anything?
    my friend said, "i would have ignored the abnormality and said something like,
    ''my, what a sweet child. how old is he?''" i said, "i would have been more honest
    and said something like, ''i''m sorry about your baby, but i hear they are able
    to do amazing reconstructive surgery now.''" abby, what do you think a parent
    of a facially disfigured child would want to hear? my friend and i are hoping
    you will respond in your column. it would be helpful to many readers. -- no name

    the heartwarming letters you have published about people doing kind deeds impulsively

    cream cones. the same young girl always waited on bob while i sat in the car --
    a ''66 t-bird. one night, with no warning whatsoever, my husband died of a heart
    attack. although we had been married for 45 years, i was devastated. about two
    months after my husband''s death, i stopped by baskin-robbins for an ice-cream
    cone. the young girl remembered me because of the car, and said, "i''ve missed
    you. where is your nice husband?" i told her that he had died suddenly. "oh, i''m
    very sorry," she said. "please, wait a minute." then she hurriedly packed a quart
    of our favorite flavor and handed it to me. "no charge," she said softly. "your
    husband was such a fine gentleman." i was so touched, i cried. -- virginia dare

    sex for seniors? why not? that''s right up my alley. i''m age 85, with a 71-year-old
    third wife, and we make love frequently. i lost my first two wives to cancer after
    almost 20 years with each. i met my present wife when i was 79 and she was 64.
    she had been with the only man in her life -- her husband of 37 years -- so i
    should not have been surprised at her obvious lack of experience. being "made
    love to" was new to her, as opposed to being an outlet for a man''s desires. once
    we got in tune with each other, we made love 10 times in nine days -- once every
    day, and twice on sunday. i kid you not. we have slowed down somewhat since i
    was hospitalized for a month after surgery to remove a cancerous colon. it was
    a month after that before we could resume our lovemaking. notice, i said "lovemaking,"
    not having sex. there is a difference. by the way, i met my third wife in church.
    after our relationship became serious, we toured europe together. different names
    on passports don''t bother hotel clerks or anyone else when two people travel
    as a couple. after living out of a suitcase for six weeks, we knew we''d either
    love each other or hate each other''s guts. we married as soon as our property
    sales were completed. my secret for a successful marriage? take your time. sex
    is a quick roll in the hay. making love is like an ocean voyage; half the fun
    is getting there. -- older but not too old'

    please say something about the widespread use of pacifiers. they are used mostly
    to pacify the parents who stick it in the child''s mouth to keep it quiet. putting
    a plug in a child''s mouth, whether it''s a genuine plug or a bottle (when used
    as a pacifier), causes the child to associate comfort and relief of stress with
    oral satisfaction, which may lead later in life to smoking, overeating or alcoholism.
    the child''s instinct to suck is usually satisfied by breast or bottle when the
    child is hungry. and don''t you hate to see a child who is old enough to walk

    and cleaning house for the two of them, and i resent it. i have enough retirement
    income to support myself comfortably and take a few trips, but i shouldn''t have
    to support jenny and junior, much less have them live with me so i can''t feel
    comfortable having an overnight guest or a dip in my pool "au naturel." so, my
    question is, how do i get rid of them? i think i''ve paid my dues, and now it''s
    my turn. what do you think? -- had it in sunny california'

    "today is my third trip to this city, totaling 240 miles. at a mere 20 cents per

    eight hours spent in travel and preparation." last month i was asked to conduct
    a funeral service for a non-church member who lived in our community. i received
    an honorarium of $100, which was greatly appreciated and set aside for a future

    from what my daughter tells me, there have been other similar incidents. their
    year-old daughter is in my care almost on a daily basis. she falls asleep in a

    i''ve heard of a device that is worn on the head of the driver. it sounds an alert
    if the driver should suddenly fall asleep. could you help me locate such a device?

    we got a good chuckle out of "very disappointed" who spent her wedding night on
    a fold-out couch in a fancy hotel. your advice to double-check reservations was
    very good, but it doesn''t always work. here''s our story: we had arranged the
    "honeymoon package" at the then brand-new hilton in erie, pa. we arrived late
    on our wedding night and were warmly welcomed at the front desk. when we got to
    our room, we found the promised bottle of champagne and a very lovely large room
    -- but no bed! it seems one of the couches was a fold-out bed with one pillow
    and a set of sheets (no blanket)! when we telephoned downstairs, we were informed
    that the hotel was full and "housekeeping" was closed for the night, so we were
    out of luck. when we folded out the bed and sat on it -- it collapsed! but what
    the heck? we''ve had many laughs over that story through the years. we''ve often
    said that a couple without a sense of humor could have broken up over such a series
    of incidents. let''s hope the honeymoon couple in that classy dallas hotel survived
    their disappointment. as for us, 13 years later, we''re ... still laughing in

    about 12 years ago, i gave a beautiful handmade quilt to my nephew and his wife
    as their wedding gift. i made it myself, and everyone who saw it said it was a
    work of art. i did not deliver it myself. another relative carried it to my nephew''s
    home. i got a thank-you for the gift, but it was not said that the gift was a
    handmade quilt. to make a long story short, a few months ago i was at this nephew''s
    home and i saw the quilt hanging on a quilt stand in their bedroom. i asked who
    made the stand and my nephew''s wife said, "my brother made the stand, and my
    grandmother made the quilt." i asked, "where is the one i gave you?" she said,
    "this is the only one we have." now, the grandmother has lived with that lie on
    her conscience all these years -- letting people believe that she made it when

    i plan to be tested very soon. the problem is: should i discuss this with my husband?
    if i tell him, it could destroy what is left of our marriage, especially if the
    test is negative. on the other hand, he has a right to know that the risk is there.

    i have a telephone answering machine. it is very handy, but sometimes it''s a

    station." well, i do not have a daughter named judy, so i called the suburban
    police station and suggested that they call judy''s parents and dial carefully
    next time. last week, an elderly woman left the following message: "doctor, i''m
    sorry i have to cancel my appointment ..." then she went on and on, describing
    all her symptoms and medications until my entire tape ran out. i also got this
    message from a young man in a hurry: "hi, joe, dis is pete. we''re gonna have
    football practice at baldwin park. call da udder guys and tell em!" last night
    i received the following message: "hi, gloria! we''re leaving right now. please

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have recently seen two letters in your column regarding the use of medicines
    by older people and the problems that medicines may cause, especially in the elderly.
    people should consider themselves "consumers," not "patients," when it comes to
    health care, particularly when it comes to the use of medications. many older
    people believe that "m.d." stands for minor deity, and they don''t ask questions
    of their doctors (or pharmacists) when they should! asking questions means taking
    some responsibility for one''s own health care. it helps to know what to expect
    from a medicine. for example, ask: 1. exactly what is this medication being used
    for? 2. how will i feel after i start taking it? 3. how will i know if the medicine
    is working? 4. what are the most common side effects i can expect? 5. can i do
    anything to prevent any of these side effects? 6. how long will i have to keep
    taking this medicine? 7. will this medicine be very expensive? about how much?
    you are doing a major service to older adults and their care-givers by calling
    attention to this issue, abby. i hope this letter is helpful to your readers.

    i was so infuriated by the letter from the woman (i won''t call her a lady) who
    couldn''t stand having workmen using her bathroom facilities, that i had to cool
    off for a couple of weeks before i could even respond. my husband is a carpenter.
    his work clothes may be stained (they get that way in his business), but they
    are clean. he showers every night to wash off the dirt -- sometimes filth -- he
    gets while he works. one cannot be stupid and be a good carpenter, plumber or
    electrician. if he''s self-employed, as my husband is, he must also be a good
    businessman. he works hard without such benefits as company-provided health insurance,
    paid vacations and pension plans. if he''s injured on the job, we''d better have
    money in the bank to live on because the state doesn''t have workmen''s compensation
    for us. and if business is slow, he can''t file for unemployment. these are some
    of the reasons why good carpenters, cabinetmakers, plumbers, etc., are becoming
    an endangered species. people like her are usually very grateful to have a workman
    show up when they have a problem -- sometimes in the bathroom she''s so stingy
    with. maybe somebody should remind her that jesus was a carpenter. would she begrudge
    him the use of her facilities? -- furious in fort wayne'

    when my husband and i go to a restaurant, we are served such large portions that
    we either have to ask for a doggie bag to take home what we can''t eat, or we
    leave it on our plates to be thrown out. at times we have ordered only one meal
    and an extra plate so we can split the dinner. this isn''t always convenient because
    we both don''t always want to eat the same thing. the few restaurants that offer
    "lighter fare" serve diet foods. why can''t these restaurant owners realize that
    all people don''t eat like harvest hands? i sometimes wonder if they realize how
    much food is wasted. how can we get the restaurant owners to offer only half-portions?

    now that you have come to the defense of school bus drivers who complained that,

    teachers, who also get no respect? we are expected to maintain order and promote
    learning in a different classroom every day with different kids who are accustomed
    to different rules. but the hardest part of our job is the abuse we have to take
    from some of the students. most kids figure that a substitute teacher is fair
    game, so they push us as far as they can to see how much they can get away with.
    if we get fed up with rotten behavior and send the troublemakers to the principal''s

    your correspondent signed "cherished memories," who is presently attending a catholic
    university and would give anything for a relationship with her philosophy professor
    who happens to be a priest, wrote: "priests are only human, after all, and they
    probably don''t relish the celibacy part of their commitment." unfortunately,
    some priests do not relish their celibacy and consider it a denial of their sexuality.
    sad to say, many laypersons take this same negative approach. rightly understood,
    however, celibacy is not a denial, but a positive attitude that gives celibacy
    the aspect of a "treasured gift" offered to god through jesus christ. it is the
    "giving of one''s self" in much the same way as the "giving" of a woman and man
    to each other in marriage. what greater gift can one give than the gift of one''s
    self? celibacy is a positive choice, and a priest who approaches his commitment
    in this light is happy in his calling. -- father x in wisconsin'

    to like this guy and she indicated that she and chuck would be back regularly
    for weekend visits! she also suggested that we take a vacation trip with them.

    as a teacher, i appreciate the way you often use your column to educate the public.
    i felt i had to respond to "proud parents of a real child," who struggle with

    proud parents of three children from korea. (we are both caucasian.) our two older
    children happen to be birth siblings. they arrived together at the ages of 7 and
    11, when our youngest son was 3. although unkind comments have been extremely
    rare, this question is often heard: "are your older children ''real'' brother
    and sister?" the question it makes me want to ask is, "why is that important to
    you?" many families are formed by birth; ours was formed by adoption. from the
    moment we accepted our children as ours, we became their real parents and they
    became real brothers and sisters. adoption is the basis for that reality, not
    blood ties. i think i speak for many other adoptive parents. maybe you can think

    i hope that by printing this letter it will make other parents do some serious
    thinking about their relationships with their teens. my neighbor''s 17-year-old
    daughter and the daughter''s 16-year-old girlfriend spent two hours talking to
    me about boys and sex. the 17-year-old is thinking about having sex with her boyfriend.
    while i certainly did not encourage it, i did talk openly about safe-sex practices
    and birth control. i also explained why it would be better if she waited until
    she is older and more mature. what bothers me the most is, why aren''t these girls
    talking to their own mothers? the girls are friends of my teen-aged sons -- that

    i am writing to you for advice about a dilemma that i never thought would happen
    to me. several months ago, i asked a girl to attend the high school prom with
    me. she didn''t say yes, but she didn''t say no either. a couple of weeks later,
    i asked her again, and she was very evasive. tired of her games, i asked another
    girl and she said yes right away. when the first girl found out that i had asked
    someone else to the prom, she became moody and distant. then i found out through
    the grapevine that she had bought a prom dress on the assumption that she was
    going with me. i have no sympathy for her. her indefinite replies left me second-guessing,
    so i asked somebody else. now several people seem to think that i am at fault.
    the way i see it, since i asked her twice without getting a definite response,
    i think i should be allowed to ask somebody else. am i right? -- self-defense'

    i am in a dilemma that i have been wrestling with for all of 1990. i have a good
    friend (i''ll call her tillie) who has three lovely little boys. when the first
    boy was born, i gave him a very nice gift on his birthday and another for christmas.
    when the second child arrived, i wanted to do the same, but i wasn''t financially
    able to give the same quality gifts as i gave the first child. now, the third
    child has arrived, and i cannot afford to give any gifts. even a lovely card strains
    my budget. the problem is that tillie is very sensitive to the fact that her second
    and third children have not received the same treatment in the gift department
    that her first child did. i know this, as she has told me so on several occasions.
    abby, how can i tactfully stop what i have started without leaving hurt feelings
    and a damaged friendship in my tracks? sweating it out'

    i recently saw a letter in your column signed "lonesome caretaker." well, abby,
    my longtime companion and i take exception to the term "caretaker" when it''s
    used to identify one who looks after the daily needs of another. the term "caregiver"
    seems kinder and much more loving and personal. i have a terminal illness, and
    my longtime companion has now become my very loving caregiver. he does not take;
    he gives. after all, what do caretakers actually do? trim your shrubs? paint your
    house? fix your faucet? they maintain objects or property, or look after cemeteries.
    regardless of how the dictionary defines caretaker, i would like to see the word
    "caregiver" used when referring to one who lovingly cares for another. abby, you
    can do a great deal toward making people aware of the difference and set a precedent
    for change. gary in cactusland'

    this is my first letter to you. it concerns my daughter and her husband. my wife

    have rented it out for double what we charged them.) my daughter had her first
    child near the end of the two-year term, and they asked for a six-month extension,
    which we granted. her husband was fired a year ago and refuses to look for another
    job. he baby-sits while my daughter supports him. they haven''t paid us a penny
    in the last six months. i suggested they hire a baby sitter to come into their
    home. they told us they do not trust anyone else with their baby. i have contacted
    them three times asking for a plan by which they will pay us in the future and
    give us a moving date, so we can sell our home! nothing is forthcoming except
    excuses. they say we are "harassing" them and are only concerned with receiving

    the letter from john zuckerman who witnessed charles lindbergh''s landing in paris
    recalled memories of my own exciting encounter with lindbergh. it took place in
    the back pasture of my father''s farm near canton, miss., soon after lindbergh''s
    famous flight. i was 17 at the time. lindbergh did not relish the publicity following
    his notable flight from new york to paris, so he always tried to land in out-of-the-way
    places. late one afternoon, i was on an errand for my mother to a nearby neighbor''s
    farm, and, as i was riding my horse across the field, i was fascinated to see
    a small plane circling over our back pasture. as i rode closer, i watched the
    little plane dip down behind the trees, then land. as i approached, i saw a tall,
    lanky man tying down his biplane. then he pitched a small pup tent under the wing.
    the plane sat in a small area surrounded by pines. three other local fellows arrived
    on the scene about the same time. one gentleman, mr. mead, asked, "aren''t you
    charles lindbergh?" he received no answer, but col. lindbergh handed mr. mead''s
    grandson, william, a pamphlet describing the flight of the spirit of st. louis.
    lindbergh refused an offer to take supper and spend the night at the meads'',
    saying he had to stay with his plane. mr. mead later took some supper to the plane.
    during the night, we had a bad thunderstorm, causing the field to become very
    muddy. at daylight, i heard the plane''s engine start as i was hurrying my horse
    to reach the spot. my family did not believe it could be mr. lindbergh in the
    field, but nothing could have kept me from going back to the plane. when i arrived,
    william and his grandfather and three other men were there watching lindbergh
    prepare to take off. the mud created a problem, so he showed us all how to hang
    on tightly to both wings while he revved up the engine. we were instructed to
    let loose when he waved his hand. the plane shook mightily until, at his wave,
    we released our hold, and away it went, barely skimming the treetops as it took
    flight. when i reported at school that day that lindbergh had spent the night
    in our pasture, no one believed me. but the following day, the jackson daily news
    reported lindbergh''s landing in meridian, miss., at 8 a.m. the previous day for
    refueling. he did not reveal where he had spent the night; he just said he''d
    flown in from the west. what a great day i had showing the paper to everybody
    at school! many years later, while i was a marine aircraft mechanic in world war
    ii, col. lindbergh came to our base as an adviser in converting our f-4u-1 aircraft
    engines to water-injection systems. i was appointed to receive his instructions,
    during which time i had an opportunity to ask him if he remembered that night
    in the mississippi pasture. he said he remembered the boy on the white horse,
    that terrible rainstorm, and the millions of ferocious mosquitoes that bombarded
    him during what he called the "worst night of my life." i, too, will never forget
    that memorable night. i met lindbergh! rea gilpin, pine bluff, ark. ----------

    i just read something in the bradenton (fla.) herald, and i can''t get it out
    of my mind. a man was found guilty of raping his three daughters over a period
    of nine years. they are now 17, 20 and 23 years old. he was sentenced to 30 years
    in prison. his wife got 15 years because she was aware of what was going on at
    the time. while her children were screaming and trying to fight their father off,
    she turned her face to the wall, pretending to be asleep! the daughters were impregnated
    a total of 10 times, and their mother took them for abortions. can you believe
    this? and now this animal and his wife will be living at the expense of the taxpayers.
    please print this, abby. the public needs to know what''s going on. hurting heart'

    are things so slow around your office that you decided to give an incredibly stupid
    answer just to see if we, your faithful readers, were paying attention, or were
    you typing with your eyes (and mind) closed that day? i''m referring to your response
    to "on the fence," the bride-to-be who wanted to "disinvite" one of her bridesmaids
    who was rumored to be involved with a married man. this sent poor "on the fence"
    into a tizzy-after all, it would be a "slap in the face to the institution of
    marriage" to have such a person in her wedding party. your advice was to disinvite
    her as a bridesmaid, but permit her to attend as a guest-wearing a scarlet "a"
    on her chest, i presume. at least you tempered your advice by suggesting she give
    the woman a chance to confirm or deny the rumor, but the abby i had grown to love
    would not have said, "get off the fence"; she would have said, "get off your high
    horse, sister." what makes "fence" so sure that all her other bridesmaids live
    up to her moral code? besides, i thought bridesmaids were selected on the basis
    of friendship, not because they were sin-free. as for the risk of having the institution
    of marriage slapped in the face by the presence of one wayward bridesmaid, the
    only people who can wound that institution are the two who are entering it. atlanta'

    i am troubled with something a reader wrote: "what right do we mortals have to
    demand an explanation from god?" abby, that writer has never known the gut-wrenching
    pain of losing a child. in 1988, my beautiful 22-year-old daughter was killed
    by a drunk driver. at first, i screamed, "he not only killed her, he killed me,
    too-only i can''t die!" i then got on my knees and begged god: "you can do anything.
    you can perform miracles. you can bring my daughter back to life. please, god,
    let me trade places with her-please let me lie in that coffin, and let her out
    to live her life. she is only 22, god. she has never been married or experienced
    the miracle of being a mother. i am old. i have lived. i''ve had my chance at
    life, but she hasn''t. please, please, let me trade places with her. you can do
    it. you can make it so that all the people who thought she died won''t be surprised
    that it''s me in the coffin and not her. please, god, let her have a chance to
    live. she didn''t deserve to die!" as you can see, abby, i''m still here-and not
    because i want to be, either. mostly because i didn''t have the guts to pull the
    trigger or take the pills to get me out of the terrible pain and loss i live with
    every minute of my life. god didn''t see fit to bargain with me. god doesn''t
    plea-bargain like men do. the drunk who killed my precious daughter (and me, too)
    spent less than six months behind bars. today, he walks in the sun while my little
    girl is in a dark grave-with no sun. god didn''t answer my prayers, and i resent
    being told that i have no right to question god. if there is a god, and if i ever
    get to meet him face to face, you can bet your life i will have plenty of whys
    for him to answer. i want to know why my little girl died and that drunk was allowed
    to live. i love her more than my life, and i miss her so. i am mad that i am having
    to live in a world where she no longer lives, and i want to know why. why shouldn''t
    i have the right to ask god? aren''t we supposedly created in his image? if so,
    surely he has a heart and soul that are capable of hurting just as i hurt. why
    would he not expect to be questioned if he has anything to do with miracles? i
    don''t fear the lord. and i don''t fear hell, either. i know what hell is like.
    i''ve already been there since the day my precious daughter was killed. please
    sign me: a bereaved mother p.s. compassionate friends has helped me more than
    anyone or anything.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    q-we are a small condo with 50 apartments. when, in the future, we need to refurbish
    the hallways, floors, elevators and fixtures, would it not be equitable to have
    all units pay equally for the improvements, since they are used and enjoyed equally
    by the owners of one- and two-bedroom units? a-i agree that it might seem equitable
    the way you put it, but the law reads that each unit owner must pay in accordance
    with the percentage of ownership he or she has in the entire condominium, or as
    has been set forth in your declaration of condominium. i find that some documents
    of older condos require such costs to be divided equally among unit owners, while
    almost all of the more recent (in the past 20 years) require the costs to be pro-rated
    based on apartment size. q-if a condo is owned by two people, and one is living
    in the condo but the other is not, how are the expenses divided? my partner in
    this agreement claims that since i am living in it i should pay all of the taxes,
    condo fees and utilities, and half of the mortgage. he, in turn, will pay half
    the mortgage and own half the equity. is that fair? a-fair is whatever you two
    agree to in writing. i would suggest you include that he pay half of any payments
    to reserve funds and for any special assessments imposed by the association. but
    this is not really a condo question. try dear abby. q-at our condo board meetings,
    the president does not permit open discussion by residents in attendance before
    the directors vote on an issue. after conducting their business and decisions
    have been made, the directors allow discussion. i think many people do not attend
    the meetings because they do not get to participate. what is the correct procedure?
    a-there is no set or established way to handle, promote or control audience participation
    at the meetings of condo boards of directors. a community association is run by
    a system of representative government, and probably should make its decisions
    based on: putting an issue on the table at one meeting, talking to advisers and
    other residents between meetings, and voting on the issue at the next meeting.
    making each meeting an emotional "town hall" usually doesn''t produce any positive
    input; the board still has to do its homework between meetings. i prefer the procedure
    of publishing the agenda ahead of the meeting and the entire board holding an
    input/feedback meeting with any or all unit owners for 30 to 60 minutes immediately
    preceding the official meeting. the regular meeting should not turn into a floor
    fight of firebrands. q-i live in a condo of 100 units with a nice dock on the
    water. the dock contains 10 boat slips complete with electric outlets and water
    for each boat. the boat slips are all filled, of course, and many others would
    like to use them. some of the boats are only used about once a month and some
    have not been moved in four or five. those of us who do not have boats are concerned
    that we have to pay for these private toys of the few. do you think the association
    should have a monthly dock charge? a-yes, of course there should be a charge.
    this is a private use of a common element. for that privilege, at the exclusion
    of other unit owners, there should be an equitable fee based upon the overall
    footage required by each boat. i would be surprised if your development''s declaration
    of condominium or bylaws doesn''t already set forth the procedure that should
    be followed. ---------- have a question about condominiums? send it to condo line,
    the miami herald, 1 herald plaza, miami, fla. 33101. questions of general interest

    what do people get out of key-scratching a nice car? i drive a red mercedes, which
    i keep in my garage. but when i leave it in a parking lot at the mall or on the
    street for a short time, i return to find scratches on the door-put there deliberately.
    the same thing has happened to my father, sister and to friends who also drive
    nice cars. i would like to know why anyone would want to deliberately scratch
    a nice car this way. seeing red in texas'

    i just read that the san mateo county (calif.) board of supervisors passed the
    nation''s first law requiring the owners of dogs and cats to buy a breeding license
    or get their pets sterilized. the article stated that the humane society said
    it was "fed up" with putting to death more than 10,000 unwanted dogs and cats
    each year-and in order to coerce the voters, they published photographs of trash
    barrels filled with dead cats they had picked up throughout the bay area. the
    society then held a public pet execution at the press conference, injecting five
    cats and three dogs with poison from a bottle marked "fatal plus" as the camera
    whirred and reporters jotted notes. abby, now anyone in san mateo county owning
    a cat or dog that has not been spayed or neutered must produce a "breeding license"
    or face a fine of $500! does this sound "humane" to you? please state your opinion.

    i couldn''t afford $39.95, but could i send a smaller donation to help the child?

    the letter signed "one plus seven" caught my eye. it was from a woman with seven
    children whose philandering husband kept telling her, "you can''t leave me-who''d
    want a woman with seven kids?" it certainly hit home with me. in 1963 my father
    died, leaving my mother with seven children younger than 15 (i''m the eldest).
    mom then adopted two war-wounded paraplegic vietnamese boys. then there were nine.
    in 1970, mom married the handsome bob debolt, who had a daughter from a previous
    marriage. then there were 10. mom and bob then adopted 10 more children; most
    were multihandicapped. then there were 20. all have been raised to be totally
    self-sufficient. but that''s not the end of the story. mom and dad also founded
    and still head a national non-profit adoption program called aask america(aid
    to adoption of special kids), which places so-called unadoptable children with
    loving permanent families and charges the parents no fees! thus, many drug-addicted
    children, fetal alcohol syndrome infants, children with aids, and scores of older
    abused, abandoned children throughout this country were able to celebrate the
    christmas holidays with their forever families. the "one-plus-seven" beginnings
    of our family have resulted in approximately "one plus 7,000" adoptions of children
    with special needs. our family received national publicity in 1978 through the
    oscar-winning documentary, "who are the debolts?" we have been honored in countless
    ways, but nothing would honor us more than to hear from people who want to adopt
    "special kids" and, i hope, from those whose generosity can continue to make this
    happen. thank you, abby, and god bless you. michele atwood, aask america, 657

    the college girl who usually sits with my 11-month-old baby was unavailable on

  body: 'dear readers: did you know there is an international forgiveness week? well,
    neither did i until three years ago when alice parenti of fresno, calif., wrote
    to tell me about it. and this is the week. if you are a card-carrying member of
    the human race, there is at least one person in your life who needs your forgiveness.
    or perhaps it''s you who needs to be forgiven, so hop aboard the mea culpa bandwagon,
    let go of those grudges and give your ulcer a chance to heal. robert muller, former
    secretary general of the united nations, wrote this lovely piece especially for
    international forgiveness week: decide to forgive decide to forgive for resentment
    is negative resentment is poisonous resentment diminishes and devours the self.
    be the first to forgive, to smile and to take the first step. and you will see
    happiness bloom on the face of your human brother or sister. be always the first
    do not wait for others to forgive for by forgiving you become the master of fate
    the fashioner of life the doer of miracles. to forgive is the highest, most beautiful
    form of love. in return you will receive untold peace and happiness. here is the
    program for achieving a truly forgiving heart: sunday: forgive yourself. monday:
    forgive your family. tuesday: forgive your friends and associates. wednesday:
    forgive across economic lines within your own nation thursday: forgive across
    cultural lines within your own nation. friday: forgive across political lines
    within your own nation. saturday: forgive other nations. only the brave know how
    to forgive. a coward never forgives. it is not in his nature. now, dear readers,
    if you will forgive me for repeating a portion of the lovely poem titled "forgiveness,"
    by george roemisch, here it is: "forgiveness is the fragrance of the violet that
    clings fast to the heel that crushed it." so, if perchance you are the "heel"
    that crushed a violet, this is the week to seek forgiveness. ---------- everything

    today i attended the funeral of a friend who had been killed in an auto accident.
    i had not seen him in several years, and was dismayed to learn that the family
    had decided to have a closed casket. at first, i assumed that the body was not
    in condition for viewing, but then i learned that this was not the case; nor was
    his family carrying out his wish-they simply decided it would be easier this way.
    abby, my heart goes out to those people, but i feel that they made two mistakes
    (easy enough to do in their grief, i realize): 1. they presumed that no one besides
    them needed to see the loved one for a visual farewell, denying others the opportunity
    to cope better with reality. (to make matters worse, this man was an educator
    who had influenced the lives of many young people. the young people had no focus
    for their grief. if i can think, "maybe it''s all a mistake; i never saw him,"
    what about kids?) 2. the family showed a lack of acknowledgment for the needs
    of dear friends, some of whom were far closer to the deceased than his kin. i
    know that nothing can change this experience for me since i was denied my farewell,
    but i hope my writing can make a difference to another decision and others'' grief.

    last december, we invited some out-of-town friends to spend the holidays with
    us. they have children and two dogs, which they take everywhere. we are not very
    fond of having animals in our house, but we really wanted to see them, so we told
    them to come and bring their dogs on the condition that the dogs be put out on
    the patio while we ate our meals. (if you don''t, the dogs are under your feet
    at the table.) well, the dogs were put out only during the christmas meal-otherwise
    they were under our feet during breakfast, lunch and dinner. they also got up
    on the furniture, and even slept in bed with our friends! i do not dislike animals,
    but i had a couple of childhood incidents with dogs that left me uncomfortable
    around them. i didn''t say anything to my guests at the time, but we would like
    them to visit again-without their dogs. how can i get them to understand our feelings?

    how humans could learn a lot from animals because they don''t start forest fires,
    kill for money or take drugs. what idiocy! they don''t build museums, preach sermons
    or work as red cross volunteers either. animals do: fight (sometimes to the death)
    for territory, females and food; kill for sport; eat their young; mate unwilling
    females; kill the offspring of conquered males; banish their weak and old. they
    kill without any regard for the terror or pain of their victims, and may calmly
    start feeding while their dinner still struggles. given the opportunity, they
    will indulge in alcohol and drugs to the point of death. respect animals, yes;
    worship them, no! they are not saints. now a question for those who believe animals
    are superior to humans: how many children do you have or plan to have? this planet
    has finite sources. every human baby requires space, food and resources. have

    just a short time ago, a little 6-year-old vancouver, wash., boy lost his life
    because he got off his school bus on a windy day with his papers in one hand.
    as he stepped off the bus, his papers blew in front of the bus, and when he went
    to retrieve them the bus ran over him, killing him instantly! i know this isn''t
    the first time something like this has happened, and it''s not going to be the
    last, unless parents and teachers work together to correct the problem. i realize
    that children are already being taught about bus safety-but what about prevention?
    i think it should be mandatory for all schoolchildren from kindergarten through
    3rd grade to have a backpack, and at the end of the day, their teachers should
    "remind" them to put all their papers into their backpacks and zip them securely.
    if that were standard practice, i doubt if there would be so many young lives
    lost. i hope this letter encourages parents of young students to buy backpacks
    for them so that they can enjoy those "very important papers" their children worked
    so hard on. those backpacks will prevent the papers from being lost-and they will
    also ensure that fewer parents will be making those dreadful funeral arrangements.

    abuse not thy body with excessive food, tobacco or drink, that thy days may be
    many and healthful in the presence of thy loved ones. permit neither thy business
    nor thy hobby to make of thee a stranger to thy children, for the most precious
    gift a parent giveth his or her family is time. forget not the virtue of cleanliness.
    make not thy mate a beggar, but willingly share with thy mate thy worldly goods.
    forget not to say, "i love you." for even though thy love may be constant, thy
    mate doth yearn to hear those words. remember that the approval of thy mate is
    worth more than the admiring glances of a hundred strangers, so cleave unto thy
    mate, and forsake all others. keep thy home in good repair, for out of it cometh
    the joys of old age. forgive with grace. for who among us does not need to be

    it is mine. some excerpts: from minnesota: i was a varsity wrestler in college.
    my best friend was getting married on the same day we were scheduled to wrestle
    an out-of-state team. my coach said if i went to the wedding, i''d never wrestle
    on his team again. i buckled under and wrestled. not only did i lose the match,
    i nearly lost my best friend too. winston-salem, n.c.: you lost your bet. i, too,
    am the coach of my 8-year-old son''s soccer team. i love soccer, but no game at
    that level should take precedence over a family wedding. this isn''t the world
    cup! the real issue here is the overemphasis on sports at such a young age. good
    for you for injecting common sense into an arena where grown men often seek lost
    youth through their son''s games. foster city, calif.: i am a female soccer coach,
    and i say the coach should go to the wedding, and so should the boy. birmingham,
    ala.: i say the boy should go to the wedding, but the coach should coach the game.
    my wife says let the kid play soccer. a wedding isn''t that big a deal. cedar
    rapids, iowa: whichever commitment was made first should be honored. allentown:
    the ringbearer thing obviously is not something the boy volunteered for. kids
    hate that stuff. i vote for soccer. massachusetts: wake up! you bet all the men
    would vote in favor of the game. i took a poll of the men where i work, and they
    all chose the wedding. get with it, ab. stereotypes are out! milwaukee: both my
    sons gave up playing in their state championship track finals to be ushers at
    their cousin''s wedding. bad choice. she was divorced three years later. denver:
    you blew it! playing in a soccer championship game is the stuff a kid''s dreams
    are made of. my 9-year-old son plays soccer, and i vote for soccer. minneapolis:
    what makes you so sure all the women will say you''re right and the men will say
    you''re wrong? i''m a woman, and i say you''re 100 percent wrong. now, get this:
    my husband has been a teacher and coach for 20 years, and he agrees with you!

    a writer signed "from the tall corn state" asked, "are there any other children
    who want to thank their parents for splitting up?" count me in. when my father
    moved out of the house, it was the biggest favor he could have done our family.
    he should have done it a lot sooner. i was a teen-ager when dad moved out. he
    and mom never got along. after he and mom divorced, believe it or not, they became
    good friends. they both met other people and eventually married. their only regret
    was waiting so long to end a marriage that was all wrong from the beginning. so

    when my daughter was 16 1/2, she met what we thought at the time was a nice young
    man, 18. he was her first real boyfriend. he came over a lot; we met his parents.
    we thought it was odd that all of a sudden he decided to transfer to college out
    of state. we found out the weekend after he left that our daughter was pregnant!
    i went to his folks and told them. that next weekend, they had their son come
    home from college and they all came over. they said that they would like to help
    out financially, but couldn''t because they had two kids in college. they bought
    their son a sports car and a motorcycle. my daughter asked him to pay $8 for half
    her vitamins. he refused. she got a few letters from him, then a phone call saying
    he had a new girlfriend, and she should just find someone else (when she is seven
    months pregnant?). my daughter was planning on going through adoption; her boyfriend''s
    parents said they sure didn''t believe in abortion. well, the adoption didn''t
    go through. she kept the baby. since she lives at home, she doesn''t qualify for
    support other than medical care for the baby. we have expenses for formulas, diapers,
    etc. she wants to finish her senior year in high school. i only hope this letter
    will help some teen-ager realize she is too young to listen to the boy she thinks
    is the greatest. my daughter thought he could do no wrong, but found out differently.

    your correspondent, "unfinished business," attended a friend''s funeral and was
    "dismayed to learn that the family had decided to have a closed-coffin burial,"
    thereby denying a visual farewell and the opportunity to better cope with reality.
    as you rightly pointed out, the next-of-kin have the final say in such matters.
    a word of amplification: the open-casket funeral is unique to the united states
    and canada. in no other country is the bizarre ritual of "viewing" the deceased
    a part of any funeral service. in the 1920s, a public relations spokesman for
    the funeral industry coined the phrase "beautiful memory picture" to describe
    the embalmed and prettified cadaver in a suitably costly casket. the funeral industry
    has long tried to convince the public that "viewing" is essential to what they
    are pleased to call "grief therapy," swallowed whole by the likes of "unfinished
    business." if that is so, how come it isn''t practiced in england, france, germany,
    etc.? to the contrary, an english jurist wrote that a public exhibition of an
    embalmed body, as that of lenin in moscow, would in england be considered a revolting
    spectacle and therefore a public nuisance. readers looking for a simple and inexpensive
    funeral should write to the continental association of funeral and memorial societies,
    an educational non-profit organization with affiliates in most major cities. the
    organization can provide information on dignified low-cost funerals. the address:

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i agree with the letter stating that pizza deliverers should receive tips just
    as good servers in restaurants do. however, i am puzzled as to who else is entitled
    to tips. recently, my husband and i had professional movers transport our furniture
    from a townhouse to a new house 10 miles away. we had a lot of furniture, so it
    wasn''t cheap. when they finished the job, i was presented with a bill on which
    was written, "tips are optional, but are appreciated." i was dumbfounded, as i
    had never tipped movers before. i told them i had no cash, so one man said, "oh,
    checks are fine!" i felt a little intimidated, but i wrote a check for the move
    itself, and made out another check for the movers for roughly 10 percent.now i''m
    wondering who else is going to hit me up for tips. can you give me some guidelines?
    my husband and i are generous when it comes to tipping food servers, hairdressers,
    barbers, bellmen, etc., but frankly, we''d go broke if we tipped every delivery/service
    person who came to the house, especially when we''re already paying for the service
    itself. but if we are expected to tip these people, what percentage is appropriate?

    our family has a problem that most families will eventually have to face. at what
    point do you sell the property, house and car of an elderly relative who is in
    a nursing home and will probably never get out? my father-in-law had a stroke
    a year ago and has been in a nursing home ever since. meanwhile, his house sits
    vacant and his car sits idle. none of his children live close enough to maintain
    the house and care for his car and they think both should be sold. my husband,
    acting as power of attorney, has been paying all the bills and says his father''s
    small life savings is being depleted. when his father was asked if his property,
    house and car should be sold, the answer was an emphatic, "no, let them sit!"
    my husband does not want his father to give up all hope for recovery and feels
    that if the assets are sold, his father will give up. we need an outside opinion.
    please rush your answer, abby, as this is causing serious dissension among family
    members. a daughter-in-law'

    there is a man i work with who always needs a ride somewhere. he owns a car, but
    it doesn''t run. he bums rides to work, to the bank, to lunch, to the mall after
    work-and these rides are not along the way; they''re sometimes 15 or 20 minutes
    out of the way. it''s not just me he hitches rides from. it seems like it''s just
    me who minds. there are two co-workers who pick him up every morning for work.
    he doesn''t have a phone, so when he decides he''s not going to work, they have
    to drive the whole way to find out. while giving him a ride, i had to stop for
    gas and discovered i had no cash with me, so he gave me $3, which i assumed was
    a gift in return for all the free rides i had given him. three days later, he
    asked me if i had forgotten about the $3 i owed him! i reluctantly gave him $3,
    but it really burned me up. after that i was so mad, i decided he would never
    get a ride from me again. now, i find myself hiding when it''s quitting time and
    making up stupid excuses to get out of giving him a ride. i don''t know what is
    more annoying: the rides, or this. how can i get out of this mess? hates freeloaders'

    i am hurting more right now than i ever have in my whole life. my beloved younger
    sister died nine months ago. i still can''t believe i will never be able to call
    her on the phone again to gossip and giggle as only sisters do. god, how i miss
    her! i asked her doctor what actually killed her, and without batting an eye,
    he said, "cigarettes!" now i feel so guilty because i, her older sister, smoked.
    thank god, i was able to quit in time. she tried to quit, but it was too late
    for her. her husband and children are inconsolable. i have learned a lot from
    this terrible experience. a smoker has a lot more to worry about than dying. my
    sister''s stay in the hospital with lung cancer wiped out her family financially.
    abby, why do advertisers make cigarette ads so attractive? instead, they should
    run a before-and-after picture of a once-beautiful woman vomiting and bald from

    may i tell you about my wonderful birthday gift? several years ago, i told my

    the community, their church, etc. we explained that we already have everything
    we need or want. our daughter, who is a single working parent, and her daughters,
    kelly, 10, and jenny, 7, decided to give me a concert at their home in honor of
    my 72nd birthday. they made tickets that were collected at the door. they even
    made programs for the evening''s entertainment. first, kelly opened with "happy
    birthday" on the trumpet. then she played the theme from "top gun" on the piano.
    next, jenny sang "memories" from "cats," and for the big finish, our daughter
    played "rhapsody in blue" on the piano, and believe me, it sounded as good as
    oscar levant with the paul whiteman orchestra. in these times when you hear only
    negative things about children, i thought you might enjoy something happy and

    i related to the letter about the husband who was a pack rat because i''m one,
    too. after years of bachelorhood, i married a woman who''d throw out the newspaper
    while i was still reading it. in the fourth year of our marriage i was sent overseas,
    leaving my wife pregnant. when i completed that tour, i was reassigned to the
    pentagon, and my wife had the thankless task of selling our home and packing and
    moving us to the washington, d.c., area. she handled all of this like a real pro.
    a year later we were entertaining guests, and i told the story of our move, bragging
    about how well my wife had handled everything alone. she casually remarked, "yes,
    and it gave me the opportunity to throw out all the junk bill had been carrying
    around all these years." i was shocked to hear her say this, as she''d never mentioned
    it before, so i asked, "and just what did you throw out?" she calmly replied,
    "what are you missing?" try as i did, i couldn''t identify a single item i missed.
    then she said, "you tell me what you''re missing, and i''ll tell you whether or
    not i threw it out." everyone (including me) had a good laugh at my expense, but
    it certainly proved her point. so, all you pack rats, clean out your closets and

    i just read the letter in your column from a minister who is "flat broke" and
    doesn''t think it''s fair that he has to pay college tuition for his two children
    who live with his ex-wife. abby, you should have checked with the missouri bar
    association before you told him that "nowhere is it written that a parent who
    is flat broke must pay to put his children through college." no doubt my ex-husband,
    on reading your reply, will be on the phone with his attorney, quoting you. please
    be assured that it is written somewhere. my ex would do anything he thought he
    could get away with to avoid supporting his children. he presently works in a
    job paying one-third of his former annual income so he could "poor-mouth" to the
    judge when it came time for the court to order him to pay support. the judge can''t
    force him to get a job at the salary he is capable of earning as long as he''s
    employed somewhere full time. guess who loses in this situation? in missouri,
    the non-custodial parent who pays child support must pay the equivalent of half
    the total cost of state university for four years-tuition, room and board, books-no
    matter where the student matriculates. st. louis woman'

    one of my best friends, "julia," has moved far away, and we keep in touch by telephone.
    my problem: julia has a 3-year-old son, and every time we talk, she puts "kenny"
    on the phone to say hello and chat a while. she does this so the rest of the time
    he will be quiet and hopefully we can talk without his whining. kenny is a very
    bright boy, but once he''s on the phone he doesn''t want to get off, and i find
    this very irritating. this has annoyed me for over a year now, so i finally wrote
    to julia asking her not to put kenny on the phone every time we talk. she was
    highly offended and said i didn''t understand her life or i wouldn''t have made
    such an insensitive request. abby, my children are grown now, but when they were
    young, i never put them on the phone to talk unless my friends requested it. i''d
    like to add that all during julia''s conversations with me, kenny keeps interrupting
    to get his mother''s attention-and when she sends him away and asks him to please
    be quiet, he makes all kinds of disruptive noises just to bug her. abby, was i
    out of line to request this courtesy? julia''s friend'

    i was shocked to read about the woman who wants to start a sperm-donor registry,

    insemination. my husband and i had three wonderful children with this method,
    so i know something about it. most people who become parents through artificial
    insemination never tell their children how they were conceived. and why should
    they? after all, their mothers were pregnant just like all the other women who
    experienced childbirth. in my case, i flew to a distant city for the insemination
    procedure to ensure absolute confidentiality. we should also consider how a sperm-donor
    registry would affect the fathers should the information be leaked-and even though
    the records are supposed to be confidential, leaks are always possible. a man''s
    sterility is nobody''s business but his own. yes, i suppose there are couples
    who are very open about having used this method of conception, but what a can
    of worms it could open for their children! ordinarily, i am one of the most honest
    and open people around, but the way our children were conceived is one family
    secret my husband and i intend to take to our graves. we have been married for
    nearly 20 years and are ever so grateful for the miracle of science that enabled
    us to have a family. i hope i never see the day when sperm donors are listed in

    i admire honest people who find valuable items and go to great lengths to return
    them. many are not rewarded. my story is somewhat different. my 9-year-old poodle
    got out of the yard by accident. she had never been loose before, and because
    she''s partially blind, she just wandered around until she lost her way. we searched
    all that day, called the pound every hour, called the local vets and went door-to-door
    to every house within three blocks of ours. the next day, we did the same thing
    until finally i placed a large sign stating "reward" at our corner grocery store.
    within an hour, our little dog was returned by a woman who lives eight houses
    from us! (we did not know her.) we later learned that this woman had found our
    dog the day before and made no effort to find the owner until the reward sign
    went up. she asked for the reward, which i gladly gave her, but i found out later
    from my son that he had knocked on her door twice during that two-day period when
    our dog was missing and was told that she had not seen the dog. what do you think

    do?" my dad was an electrician, and he said he would never ask to use a customer''s
    bathroom. when he would drive to a new customer''s house, he would look the area
    over and locate the nearest gas station, and if he needed to use the facilities
    while working, he would tell the customer he had to return to the shop to pick
    up a tool or something, but he wouldn''t charge them for the time he was gone.
    maybe employers should tell their people to follow that example. how would you

    i am writing to plead with you to change your answer to a recent letter concerning
    dead-bolt locks. the writer reported that the homes of several invalids that he
    had made deliveries to were equipped with dead-bolt locks requiring a key to exit
    the homes. he also said the windows were secured with iron bars. he suggested
    that the occupants should wear the key around their neck to facilitate their exit
    in case of an emergency, such as a fire. you said he had an excellent idea. please,
    please change your answer. tell everyone that you can reach that they should never,
    under any circumstances, install double dead-bolt locks on their home or apartment
    doors! the double dead-bolt lock turns an ordinary home into a tomb in the event
    of a fire. smoke conditions found in an ordinary house fire could make it impossible
    for even the most alert, physically fit person to exit the home under these conditions.
    (it is impossible to see or even take a full breath when you''re gagging from
    smoke-and terrified.) i have seen an entire family lying just inside the front
    door, which was locked from the inside with a double dead-bolt lock. the key was
    there, but the door was still locked. unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.
    window bars also prevent firefighters from rescuing trapped occupants in time
    to save their lives. how much of a chance would an invalid have in a similar circumstance?
    besides, what good would a double dead-bolt lock do for an invalid in the event
    that an intruder gained entry to the home and wanted the key to unlock the door
    from the inside to get out? i simply cannot imagine what the advantage of such
    a lock is under any circumstances. what possible reason could people have to lock
    themselves inside a building? locking people out makes sense, but locking people
    in does not. although i expect that my chances of seeing this in print are very
    slim, i implore you to consider running it in the best interest of your readers.
    fire officials across this country have been advocating the elimination of double
    dead-bolt locks for many years, to little avail, and we need help. they are prohibited
    in dwelling units in the state of michigan and, in our opinion, their sale should
    also be against the law. william h. crouch, president, southeastern michigan fire

    i recently attended a wedding, a company dinner and a commemorative dinner. at
    all three events, professional and amateur video camera users were present. at
    the company dinner, those who were called up to receive their bonus checks were
    hidden by camera holders. at the commemorative dinner, a tripod was set up directly
    in front of our table; when i asked the cameraman to kindly move, he refused and
    suggested that i move my chair. where? we all had assigned seats, and there were
    no empty seats. the wedding was a "production" produced to make the video to preserve
    for posterity. the wedding party and the guests were ordered around by the cameraman
    who was paid to get a video of the ceremony from start to finish. there were also
    amateur camera holders, and even flashbulbs going off! it was a farce. abby, why
    must the magic of the present be sacrificed in an effort to preserve "memories"?
    please comment. these camera and video enthusiasts should not be permitted to
    run (and ruin) everything. old-fashioned'

    my fiancee and i are both energetic, productive citizens who work overtime seven
    days a week to provide a better life for our children. we are a middle-aged, upper-income
    couple with maximum debt (due to our former marriages), in love, engaged and want
    to get married. the problem is we can''t afford to because our federal and state
    income tax could increase $11,000 and $5,000, respectively. this means we would
    have to earn an additional $25,000 in taxable income in order to meet this obligation,
    and we simply can''t do that. the tax code is obviously unfair when a couple can''t
    afford to get married because of additional taxes, and i won''t ask even dear
    abby to rectify that problem. but, do you know of any place or any way we can
    be married in a christian ceremony, without having to declare our marriage for
    federal and/or state income tax purposes? overtaxed in the u.s.a.'

    i am a 24-year-old guy who recently faced a big decision. two years ago, i decided

    most fun time of my whole life-dating, parties and the general good time that
    comes from living with friends. well, things started to change shortly after i
    moved. i was not really prepared financially at the time i moved out. i went deeper
    and deeper into debt. i will not give you the exact amount except to tell you
    that it went well above $10,000, not including my car loan. i asked myself over
    and over again, "how did i let this happen?" there were no answers. it was plain
    stupidity. i considered bankruptcy because i couldn''t pay all of my bills with
    my salary, and it seemed like a good way out. my parents wanted me to move back
    home with them and pay my bills back. abby, bankruptcy seems so simple-an easy
    way out. the bankruptcy lawyers will tell you that it will be on your record for
    only 10 years. but this is not the whole truth. when you fill out a credit application,
    it asks, "have you ever filed bankruptcy?'' if you say, "yes," you really don''t
    have too good a chance. if you say "no," that''s fraud. abby, please help me tell
    other young people that they shouldn''t file chapter vii. tell them, instead,
    to swallow their pride and go back home if they can, because the long-term effect
    on their credit rating is devastating. humbled in san diego'

    a relative has informed my husband and me that from now on, her gifts to us will

    nothing, we wouldn''t love her less. however, i think the idea of giving to charity

    10 percent of our gross income to charity, and when we give a gift, it''s a gift.
    for our wedding many years ago, someone made a donation to charity in our honor,

    in a recent issue of parade magazine, i saw a brief article (enclosed) that disturbed
    me greatly. it details a parent granting permission for his 6-year-old child to
    donate a kidney to a chimpanzee suffering from simian nephritis! the item read,
    "the father of little brandy oxenrider visited the ailing primate in his cage
    at the perkins animal clinic in atlanta, bearing a large bunch of bananas. "`as
    a family, we are 100 percent committed to animal welfare,'' said the father, a
    40-year-old health food store owner, `but sometimes it can be kind of frustrating.
    i heard about a laboratory rat out in california who needs a heart transplant.
    i''d really like to donate mine, but how will it fit into that tiny little chest
    cavity?'' " abby, removing a kidney from a 6-year-old child for donation to a
    chimpanzee is outrageous! it''s one thing for an adult to make an informed decision
    based on facts and potential risks to donate an organ, but this 6-year-old obviously
    does not understand the risks of surgery and going through life with only one
    kidney. unless this child were terminally ill with no hope for recovery, this
    is outright child abuse and should be stopped! if this were the case, there would
    be lots of parents or children on transplant waiting lists who would be disappointed
    and angry to hear of this situation. although i am not an expert on inter-species
    transplants, as a physician who has some knowledge of human-to-human transplants,
    i believe the chances for success are far greater in twins or siblings. even the
    chimp would be better served if it were to receive a donor kidney from another
    chimp-and preferably a blood relative. quite frankly, i am at a loss to understand

    with the increase of foreign adoptions in our country, perhaps it''s time to introduce
    some "adoption etiquette" to the public. my husband and i adopted a beautiful
    child from korea. since she is asian and we are caucasian, it is obvious that
    we are not her natural parents, but we are constantly approached by strangers
    who ask these questions: "is she your real child?" (when our child hears this,
    she may wonder if she''s "real" or "unreal," which could confuse her.) "don''t
    you have any children of your own?" (she may wonder that if she isn''t ours-whose
    child is she?) "how much did she cost?" (this question is very offensive. adopted
    children are not purchased; legal fees for adoption differ vastly.) "how could
    anyone give away such a beautiful child? you must be very special people to take
    in someone else''s child." (when our daughter hears this, she assumes she wasn''t
    wanted, so we took her in.) "bet you get pregnant now!" (if the painful infertility
    issue applies, how rude to bring it up.) "what happened to her `real'' parents?"
    (do these ignorant, insensitive people think we would stand in a supermarket and
    discuss such a personal matter with a stranger?) abby, the list could be much
    longer, but i think you have the idea. well-wishers should confine their comments

    a few years ago, as part of a group of about 100 tourists, i found myself in kiev,
    russia, in a large dining hall. one member of our group, gene, who was a wonderful
    organizer, initiated group singing in the spirit of international friendship.
    he circulated between the long tables and asked for suggestions as to which songs
    could be sung by the largest number of our group. we began with "i''ve been workin''
    on the railroad," and i''ve been amused ever since wondering how any translator
    could explain that song to a foreign audience. a group of jordanians responded
    lustily with a stirring jordanian song. then some other groups, no doubt some
    of them russian, contributed to the entertainment. we couldn''t understand the
    words, but the spirit of nationalistic pride was evident in every measure. when
    our turn came, we sang "america the beautiful," and a few others, which has me

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    after 20 years of what started out as a perfect marriage, my wife and i were divorced
    several years ago. the reason: my wife''s rather open adulterous relationships-there
    were five of them that i know about. the final blow was our teen-age daughter
    walking in on her mother and lover in our bed. my ex has remarried and lives a
    thousand miles away. while the divorce was painful for me, fortunately my own
    life is about back to normal. however, the men involved are walking around unbruised
    from their part in the destruction of our marriage. although my religion teaches
    to forgive trespasses against us, i''m still torn up over it all and feel that
    in order to achieve complete recovery, i should write all five men a letter (signed,
    of course) and let them know what their part in the affairs did to me and my children.

    with all the talk these days about "mercy killing," i have yet to find what i

    when they die? and by the same token, are not those caring for the sick ones (especially
    close relatives) securing for themselves a place in heaven? and regarding putting
    suffering animals out of their misery: how can anyone compare humans to animals?
    an animal has no soul, and for an animal, death is final. but humans have souls,
    and the way we handle life''s challenges-especially incurable illnesses-will decide

    i just read the letter from the married woman signed "gladys," who said she was
    in love with a married man, but neither of them would consider divorce. they meet
    privately and hug and kiss passionately, but no sex. she asked you if this could
    be considered an "affair." it sounded familiar. listen to this: ten years ago
    i suspected my husband was having an affair with a woman at the office. i confronted
    him and he denied any physical affair. he said he just couldn''t get away from
    her - she always needed to "talk." i gave him a choice, her or me. he chose me.
    well, he talked to her, and she came to our home to deny any physical affair and
    to ask if they could just have a bible study at lunch hour together. my reply
    was "no," they couldn''t even do that! shortly afterward, this woman and her family
    moved into our neighborhood and joined our church. three months ago, my husband
    said, "we have to talk. i have been committing adultery for the last 10 years
    with this woman at the office. please forgive me. i promise never to see her again."
    when i finally calmed down, he said, "wait, there''s more." abby, this woman had
    such an attack of conscience that she went to our pastor and confessed everything,
    so the pastor called on me and told me that we could no longer attend his church!

    with the recent hike in postage rates, plus the cost of the thank-you notes themselves

    far too much emphasis is put on the written thank-you note. in most cases, young
    couples are struggling to support themselves, set up housekeeping, pay rent and
    utilities, and many - such as ourselves - are still in college. may i suggest
    the following options to the written thank-you note: 1. a phone call to say thank
    you for the wedding gift. having a chance to visit for a few minutes on the telephone
    would suit me just fine. 2. a warm hug and sincere thanks at the next family,
    church or social gathering would mean much more to me than an expensive, written

    "gladys" claims that her longtime relationship with an older man was ok because
    although there had been intimate touching, passionate kissing and telephone conversations
    two or three times a day, they never had sex. my husband was involved in a similar
    relationship for three years. she was 23 years younger than he, and they, too,
    swore there was never any sex-they were just "good friends." bull! even if you
    believe these two liars are not having sex, the betrayal of the marriage vows
    is clear. i didn''t believe my husband either, but i chose not to divorce him.
    after he found out that i was wise to him, he said he no longer sees "that slut,"
    but his credibility has been so badly damaged, i no longer believe a word he says.
    there are days when i want to throw him out, but then i recall how much i loved
    him before all this happened. my husband''s girlfriend is also married, but her
    husband is mercifully in the dark. sometimes i itch to tell her husband in order
    to shatter her world as she shattered mine; then i think of all the innocent people
    who would be hurt, and i back off. what do you think? should i expose the affair
    and get my revenge? my therapist says i should think only of myself and tell.

    this concerns the elderly gentleman who had been in a nursing home for a year
    after suffering a stroke and whose family asked what to do about his house and
    automobile. when they asked him, he had replied, "let it sit!" they then turned
    to you, abby, for wise counsel, and you agreed with the old man. i think your
    answer was way off base for the following reasons: 1. after a year, he isn''t
    going anywhere. if he were, it would be to a condo or retirement home in the same
    city as a relative. 2. after his life savings are gone, in some states his children
    must pay, and nursing homes are expensive. this is money down the drain that could
    be used for their own retirement or their children''s college education. he lived
    his life; now you live yours, without guilt. 3. think of the neighbors. would
    you want an empty, unkempt home next to yours? 4. the old man''s property will
    go down in value if it is not cared for. 5. he will never agree to selling his
    car-so you do it! you will have to endure his endless griping about it, but you
    will have saved innocent people from harm. get his doctor''s opinion about his
    medication and his ability to drive. chances are, the doctor will tell you he
    shouldn''t drive again. (he''ll probably put up a fight and continue to gripe.)
    6. get him to sign a living will, so he won''t linger in a dreadful condition.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    the continuing abortion controversy is not about killing babies, but about preventing
    them. people opposed to the procedure have been twisting semantics to promote
    their side of the issue. the dictionaries will prove my point, because this is
    where the meaning of words in the english language is explained for everyone to
    read and understand. webster''s describes a baby as "newborn," period! consequently,
    the abortion procedure should more realistically be referred to as preventing
    a baby. the people who project those horrible baby-killing images during a woman''s
    early months of pregnancy are trying to characterize women as murderers. these
    same people claim they are fighting for the "rights of the unborn." webster''s
    also states there is no fetus until after the third month of pregnancy. women
    get fearfully nervous after missing a period for several weeks if they aren''t
    planning a family. if abortion is readily available by competent doctors at a
    reasonable price, the chances are much better the procedure will be performed
    during a rudimentary stage of development when there is no fetus-only an undeveloped
    fertilized egg. no one has ever suggested a compromise in the abortion issue.
    if the procedure were declared legal only during the first three months of pregnancy,
    possibly the pro-life crowd would more willingly accept it. an undeveloped fertilized
    egg doesn''t describe a baby any more than a seed describes a rose bush. using
    the pro-life logic, one could say a vehicle was in existence after a nut and bolt
    were joined at the beginning of an automobile assembly line. what rights does
    a rudimentary ovum or sperm have over a complex, grown woman who has managed to
    survive in this frenzied and tumultuous world? some people would treat pregnant
    women no differently than pregnant cows in the pasture, being concerned only with
    their potential offspring. women who elect to have an abortion only want to take
    charge of their own lives. what woman in this world wants to kill babies, particularly
    her own? not one, unless you, too, fall prey to this continuing semantic malarkey.

    i sympathize with "a touchy ticket taker" who was forced to accept a wet and unsanitary
    portion of a ticket. and who can blame her? i suggest that she have in her hand
    an ordinary wooden clothespin, and when the ticket is presented to her, she should
    grasp the ticket between the prongs of the clothespin and deposit it where she
    wishes. in this way, she will accomplish two things: 1. she will not be forced
    to handle a wet and unsanitary ticket, and . . . 2. the patrons will see the gross
    position in which they have placed the ticket taker, and possibly mend their ways
    without her needing to voice an objection. i would appreciate your thoughts on
    my suggestion. stephen ludovich, brooklyn, n.y.'

    it happened again, and i am angry! i am the administrator of a nursing home. one
    of our residents passed away, after spending the last four years of her life here,
    and i just came from her funeral. the minister said all the right things to her
    family who practically ignored her, but no mention was made of the fact that she
    spent the last four years of her life in a nursing home. we who loved her and
    cared for her during her last years have been denied acknowledgment that we are
    grieving, too. when i watched her family file down the aisle at the funeral, i
    was astonished at the number of relatives she had! there was a son i didn''t even
    know existed, living only 15 miles from here. i counted daughters, sons, cousins,
    grandchildren and great-grandchildren-46 of them. if each one had visited that
    dear lady once a week, she would have had company constantly. but did she? no.
    hardly anyone came to see her. and those who did never stayed more than 30 minutes.
    that dear lady died with all her mental faculties intact. she read her bible every
    day, kept her room neat and dusted, and always had her hair combed before coming
    to the dining room. most families appreciate us, but many do not. perhaps someday
    people will be more attentive to their elderly relatives living in nursing homes.
    this may be too long for your column, and it may offend many, so i will understand
    if you cut some of it out. but if you print only part of my message, i will thank

    or kiss a chicken. how can i make him act better? he thinks he is funny. but i
    think he is stupid to do that. i don''t like it at all. please help me." "dear
    stuck with weirdo," kazi responded. "maybe your brother does that because he wants
    you to laugh," she wrote in her usual unsparing style. "the next time he does
    his weird stuff just give him a serious look or even a dirty look. do that two
    or three times and he will get the message. make sure you don''t laugh. it will
    work." perhaps it will. after three years counseling the troubled and lonely of
    the school yard, kazi has attracted a following big enough to keep three post
    office boxes filled. "kids aren''t immune to problems," says the 9th-grader at
    booker t. washington high school in tulsa. "i want to let them know there is someone
    there, someone they can trust." the making of an adviser before kazi found her
    calling, she rarely read advice columns. "i thought dear abby was not for me,"
    she says. "it was an adult-type thing." one 5th-grade morning, kazi turned the
    advice industry into a kid-type thing. gwen swift, then a teacher at woodward
    elementary school in stillwater, okla., had assigned her 4th-graders the task
    of producing a schoolwide news show. she thought they''d get a charge out of bringing
    on an advice columnist-someone older and wiser, someone savvy about playground
    politics, someone smart and well-spoken, someone like kazi. "she took to it like
    a duck to water," says swift. kazi, grinning through her braces, agrees. "some
    people love to sing, some people love to draw," she said while vacationing in
    chicago last week. "i love giving advice." on the show, kazi fielded 4th-grade
    basics: how to make it through recess intact, coping with your best friend''s
    new best friend, pesky sibling management, tactics for juggling homework and chores
    and play. that spring, the stillwater newspress ran a sample of her work. kazi,
    equally skilled in the arts of public relations and human relations, sent the
    article to johnny carson. a few weeks later, in september 1988, she was advising
    carson on the air. "i couldn''t believe it when i was actually shaking his hand,"
    she says. "when i watched it on tv, it was like a thrill. it was proof it wasn''t
    a dream." returning from dreamy burbank, calif., kazi struck a deal with the stillwater
    newspress to run her column each sunday. dear shabana often bumps up against dear
    abby. last year, kazi and her family moved to tulsa. she added the tulsa tribune
    to her client list in october. answers to go kids-and a few parents and teachers-send
    their troubles to dear shabana in care of the papers or at her own post office
    box, or drop them in the manila envelopes she posts at elementary schools. each
    week, kazi collects the letters. on weekend mornings, she sits in bed or at her
    desk to read, sort and answer. her sister, shaheen, 12, runs the typing department.
    kazi then mails separate versions to the papers. ron wolfe, her editor at the
    tulsa tribune, and janet varnum, her editor at the newspress, occasionally add
    information, such as a hot line phone number, but in honor of the column''s "all
    kid" flavor, rarely change her prose. "the whole point is it''s a kid talking
    to other kids," says wolfe. "she''s tackled some really tough questions. i''m
    not sure i could have answered them as well." kazi''s weekly fee: $10 from each
    paper, which, as dear shabana would surely suggest, she deposits into savings.
    `just natural from the heart'' from a school audience of 450 to a two-city circulation
    of about 80,000, kazi''s message has remained steady: study hard, confide in your
    teachers and parents, try to see your problems from other points of view. and
    for those girls pining after oblivious boys: " ... on a special occasion you could
    write him a love song or poem. i think he should get the message when he reads
    it. find out first if he likes you by striking a general conversation with him
    and then proceed." but the troubles that arrive penned with dubious spelling,
    penciled on blue-lined, three-ring notebook paper have grown more complex. some
    kids still fret over the embarrassment of sleeping with a teddy bear or the humiliation
    of bullies calling them "the stuff between your toes." a lot more worry about
    their parents going through divorce or drinking problems. some complain they get
    hit at home. one boy wondered if he should move in with his father who was about
    to be released from jail. a middle-school student asked for advice on her pregnancy.
    that one was too much even for kazi, who says her advice springs "just natural
    from the heart" without interference from self-help books or research. she consulted
    with a school counselor before advising the girl to break the news to her parents,
    slowly. kazi credits her own family with her success. "in our family, we''re lucky.
    we can talk to each other. we have disagreements once in a while, but we eventually
    talk it out. i understand not everyone can. that''s the reason i am doing the
    advice column. when they have no one else to turn to, they can write to me." caption:

    would you be so kind as to remind your readers about the united nations bill of
    rights for children? the bill states that children should have the following rights:
    - the right to affection, love and understanding. - the right to adequate nutrition
    and medical care. - the right to free education. - the right to full opportunity
    for play and recreation. - the right to a name and nationality. - the right to
    be among the first to receive relief in times of disaster. - the right to learn
    to be a useful member of society and to develop individual abilities. - the right
    to be brought up in a spirit of universal peace and brother/sisterhood. - the
    right to enjoy these rights, regardless of race, color, sex, religion, national
    or social origin. this bill was adopted in 1989 by the u.n. general assembly after
    a decade of discussion. it has been signed by 109 countries and ratified by 40.
    unbelievable as it seems, the united states has done neither. our nation, built
    on the concepts of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, should be leading
    the world nations in the pursuit of their goal of protecting our most valuable

    promiscuous sex seems to be a major topic these days. what should we do about

    army air corps, we were brave young men - normal, healthy and innocent - and we
    were going off to war. the air corps, in its wisdom, showed us very graphic movies
    that explained what could happen to our bodies if we caught what they called in
    those days a "social disease." believe me, it wasn''t pretty. i saw big strapping
    men faint, and some became nauseated and ran from the room while viewing these
    movies. they were always shown on friday afternoon, just before the men took off
    for a big weekend. let me hasten to say that the movies did not kill off our sexual
    desires. what they did was increase the demand for condoms, which were free for
    the asking at the checkout desk. we all know that sex is here to stay. all healthy,
    normal people are interested in sex, and nothing is going to change that. perhaps
    now is the time to start showing those movies again - only this time, they should

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i''m going to go out on a limb here and predict that the next spokeswoman for
    no excuses jeans will be a woman named gennifer flowers, described as a television
    reporter turned nightclub singer. how do you go from being a television reporter
    to being a nightclub singer? and whose idea was it to spell gennifer with a g?
    well, never mind. that''s frivolous and this is serious. it''s a presidential
    election year, and so naturally the nation is learning about sex and taxes. this
    week we''re on the adultery watch with gov. bill clinton of arkansas, a big guy
    with a grin and a small cloud of rumors about his onetime private life that has
    pretty much followed him everywhere since he declared. ms. flowers says they had
    a 12-year just-one-of-those-things, which didn''t stop her from taping a valedictory
    call from clinton in which, it is alleged, he told her to deny their involvement.
    (dating tips for guys: watch those women who have recording devices attached to
    their phones.) ms. flowers told her story to the star, which is that publication
    you can find at the supermarket checkout counter right next to the gum and the
    little things that keep your glasses from hurting your nose. you buy the star
    by hiding it beneath your box of total, pretending it fell onto the conveyor belt.
    the star paid ms. flowers for her story. the governor says the story''s not true.
    let''s pretend for a moment that we''re discussing real life here instead of politics.
    sadly enough, these things happen. they may simply happen more frequently to politicians.
    just as we''ve come to accept that most politicians of a certain age likely smoked
    pot at some time in their past, so we''ve come to accept that, given the combination
    of megalomania and charisma needed to run for office, some candidates may at one
    time have found ego gratification with actress/models or television reporter/nightclub
    singers, the kind of women who, when they go public, tend to have flattering 8-by-10
    glossies readily available. this matters to different people in different degrees,
    from those who think it is unforgivable to those who think it''s inevitable. call
    it character. call it a way of seeing women. call it the sleaze factor. you put
    together "forsaking all others," "i will never lie to you" and "here''s my room
    key," and you''ve got a credibility gap, in real life and in politics too. in
    the last 30 years, we have moved from wondering whether it happens to wondering
    whether it matters. now we care about how it is handled, about getting out of
    a jam with dignity. many will argue that gary hart was toppled not by his indiscretions
    but by the fact that he defied reporters to discover him in flagrante and then
    gave them delicto to spare. (others suggested that any man engaging simultaneously
    in a presidential race and a dalliance was too dumb to ever grapple with the deficit.)
    clinton tried to head this issue off at the pass by meeting with the press some
    months ago to say that his marriage wasn''t perfect but he and his wife had worked
    hard to stay together and that was that. hillary clinton, who is smart and beautiful,
    was with him when he did this and was with him again sunday night when the two
    appeared on "60 minutes." that matters. some women will tell you that what turned
    them against hart was the sorry spectacle of his wife defending a man who had
    publicly humiliated her. you could argue that you should never confuse real life
    and politics or you will begin to believe things that ronald reagan says. but
    the fact is that the man who would be president tries to make himself something
    between a buddy and a boss when he is running, and if we judge him the way we
    would either-or the way we might a husband-it is understandable. the persona has
    become as important as the positions. if this were not so, infidelity would be
    a non-issue and paul tsongas would be the democratic front-runner. if this were
    real life, dear abby would tell you that if you loved bill clinton enough, you
    should accept his story and put all this out of your mind. and that''s probably
    good political advice too. i''m not sure anyone loves clinton that much yet. the
    democrats i talk to have a clear idea of who they want for president: abb. anyone
    but bush. if enough people feel that bill clinton is necessary to his party, his
    alleged indiscretions will become secondary to his absolute indispensability.'

    my wife and i have a big disagreement about women sitting at the bar when tables
    are available to them. she feels that as long as she is with a girlfriend (or
    girlfriends), it is perfectly all right. i disagree. as a male, i have a fairly
    good idea about how most men think. for the most part, when a man walks into a
    bar looking for someone to hit on, if he sees a woman sitting at the bar, he figures
    she''s probably looking for company. how do you vote on this? j. in chicago'

    a couple of years ago, my best friend''s husband (i''ll call him burt) put his
    hand up my dress after an evening out with friends. i froze and went numb. he''d
    had a few drinks, and i later assumed he had mistaken me for his wife who was
    sitting next to me. (i''ll call her gina.) two years have passed and nothing was
    said about the "incident." it took a while to resume any social engagements as
    a couple, but time helped to put the incident in the past. now, after a disagreement
    with my husband that burt found out about, he arrived at my house in the middle
    of the day. he told me he had always been attracted to me, and he''d like our
    friendship to go further. i was shocked, and told him i never meant to lead him
    on and would never jeopardize my marriage by having an affair with him, or anyone
    else. i said i valued my friendship with gina - then asked if he was in the habit
    of fooling around with gina''s friends. he said that he had - but only once -
    then named the woman, and asked me to promise not to say anything to my husband
    or his wife. burt said he felt like a fool, was totally embarrassed, but didn''t
    i feel flattered? i told him no - i felt insulted. then i asked him to leave.

    with your professional friends? (he will, you know.) and how comfortable will

    "on the fence in waukegan" must be thinking with her hormones. this well-educated,
    successful, career woman needs to take a good hard look at the man with whom she''s
    considering spending the rest of her life. she says he''s somewhat immature, is
    still very attached to his buddies, and enjoys the bar scene - then she hastens
    to add, "two beers is his limit." can''t she see the handwriting on the barroom
    wall? she admits that perhaps this man may be "too simple" for her, and she might
    grow bored. abby, i think "on the fence" should have signed herself, "off my rocker."

    i am 70 years old. i''ve been talking to myself since i was 11. i know i talk
    to myself a lot, but i''ve always tried to avoid being caught at it. recently,
    however, a neighbor told me he saw me in my car, talking to myself. once, i saw
    a woman coming down the aisle of the supermarket, totally oblivious of the people
    around her, talking to herself out loud. i could see myself in the future. then
    i read a letter in your column from a man who had bitten his fingernails since
    childhood, until he read a letter in dear abby that he could break the habit by
    wearing a rubber band around his wrist. the moment he realized he was about to
    chew his nail, he would snap the rubber band just hard enough to make a little
    sting, and it would distract him and curb the urge. a month later, i am almost
    cured! i did learn to be careful not to wound myself as i snapped the rubber band.

    - and soon it was followed by a ten commandments for men. then an early feminist,

    that there should be only one set of commandments for both genders. well, ms.
    stillman won - and here they are: ten commandments for a successful marriage 1.
    put your mate before your mother, your father, your son and your daughter, for
    your mate is your lifelong companion. 2. do not abuse your body with excessive
    food, tobacco or drink, so that your life may be long and healthy, in the presence
    of those you love. 3. do not permit your business or your hobby to make you a
    stranger to your children, for the most precious gift a parent can give his or
    her family is time. 4. do not forget that cleanliness is a virtue. 5. do not make
    your mate a beggar, but willingly share with him or her your worldly goods. 6.
    remember to say, "i love you." for even though your love may be constant, your
    mate yearns to hear those words. 7. remember always that the approval of your
    mate is worth more than the admiring glances of a hundred strangers, so remain
    faithful and loyal to your mate, and forsake all others. 8. keep your home in
    good repair, for out of it come the joys of old age. 9. forgive with grace. for
    who among us does not need to be forgiven? 10. honor the lord your god all the
    days of your life, and your children will grow up and bless you.'

    has come to an end, and everyone is frantically trying to stick to new year''s
    resolutions, having slipped only occasionally. this year, today through saturday
    is international forgiveness week, so perhaps there''s still time to slip in one
    more important resolution for 1992: be forgiving. if you are a card-carrying member
    of the human race, there is at least one person who needs your forgiveness. (or
    perhaps it''s you who needs to be forgiven?) so climb aboard the mea culpa bandwagon
    and read on: former assistant secretary general of the united nations robert muller
    wrote the following for international forgiveness week: decide to forgive decide
    to forgive for resentment is negative resentment is poisonous resentment diminishes
    and devours the self be the first to forgive, to smile and to take the first step,
    and you will see happiness bloom on the face of your human brother or sister.
    be always the first do not wait for others to forgive for by forgiving you become
    the master of fate the fashioner of life the doer of miracles to forgive is the
    highest, most beautiful form of love. in return you will receive untold peace
    and happiness. here is the program for achieving a truly forgiving heart: sunday:
    forgive yourself. monday: forgive your family. tuesday: forgive your friends and
    associates. wednesday: forgive across economic lines within your own nation. thursday:
    forgive across cultural lines within your own nation. friday: forgive across political
    lines within your own nation. saturday: forgive other nations. only the brave
    know how to forgive. a coward never forgives. it is not in his nature. robert
    muller p.s. many years ago, long before i became dear abby, i came across this
    particularly poignant description of forgiveness, attributed to george roemisch:
    "forgiveness is the fragrance of the violet which still clings to the heel that
    crushed it." and now, dear readers, if you have read this in my column before,
    please forgive me. i devoutly believe this message is worth repeating. a favor,

    restrooms unsupervised. last week, i went to the women''s room at o''hare airport

    door. she was barely big enough to get up on the stool. she was sitting on the
    bare toilet seat, and had an accident because she wasn''t big enough to sit back
    all the way. i assisted her, had her wash her hands, and escorted her to the waiting

    at a gas station having work done on my car and observed a girl about 7 go into

    last week, my husband''s aunt and i were talking at a relative''s wedding reception.
    she asked me how long joe and i had been married. when i told her, she sighed

    she then repeated herself in exactly the same sad tone, so i asked her what she
    meant by that remark. she replied, "well, joe was much more fun when he was drinking."
    abby, when we first met, joe was a big drinker, but he gave it up and made a pledge

    what has happened to the english language? the excessive use and misuse of the
    word "like" is an abomination! to utter the incoherent, "i was, like, you know,
    going home," incriminates the user; as does, "it was, like, saturday." "like"
    is a substitute for "about," "approximately," "similar to," "it may have been,"
    or many other terms or expressions. and "i go" and "he goes" are stupid contortions
    for "i said, stated, noted, observed," and other correct usages. "hopefully" is
    used far too often and invariably ungrammatically. and athletes, especially, seem
    incapable of stumbling and fumbling through even a half sentence without a "hopefully."
    this incorrect redundancy could be replaced with "i hope," "i would hope" or "we
    will attempt to." the sports announcers are the worst. we can surely do without
    the "hey" and "guys" in every other sentence. they are infuriating. kenneth f.

    i went a bit astray as a teenager. i gave myself to my boyfriend in every way.
    i turned my back on my family - especially on my mother, who raised me alone since

    that boyfriend, i jumped into a relationship with a man who turned out to be both
    mentally and physically abusive. i was scared and embarrassed, and didn''t want
    anyone to know the terror i was living in. when things got so bad that my life
    was in danger, i literally escaped from that terrible man. guess where i went?
    back to my mother. we did a lot of talking and i did a lot of apologizing. we
    rebuilt the bridges i had burned. during the next four years, my mother became
    my best friend. when she retired, i didn''t have enough money to give her a big
    gift, so i gave her an invitation to have lunch with me every tuesday. (by then

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    writers for the tribune and sun-times agreed last week. the unpleasantness in
    grand beach, mich., involving mayoral offspring patrick daley and an illicit house
    party that got out of hand was "every parent''s nightmare." and, as a parent,
    i can confirm this. once a month or so, i bolt awake in a cold sweat imagining
    youthful beer fests in my heedless absence, fights erupting, lawn statuary breaking,
    sirens wailing. truth is, i''d have this nightmare more often were it not for
    all the different parental nightmares i now have just trying to keep up. in 1983,
    abc-tv''s "20/20" gravely informed us that child sexual abuse is "every parent''s
    nightmare," though a 1985 tribune article was emphatic that being murdered by
    one''s children is "every parent''s nightmare." syndicated columnist george will
    asserted the following year that paralysis of a child is "every parent''s nightmare,"
    notwithstanding a sun-times view of "every parent''s nightmare-the terminal illness
    of a son or daughter." in 1987, time magazine observed that the way 18-month-old
    jessica mcclure tumbled down a back-yard well was "every parent''s nightmare,"
    the sun-times featured a book that "confronts every parent''s nightmare: the child
    who remains an adolescent forever," and the detroit free press recorded that "teenagers
    in a rage and out of control are the stuff of every parent''s nightmare." in 1988,
    time said a new york city prep school student "played out every parent''s nightmare"
    when he wrecked a car, then was killed by police after committing armed robbery
    in an attempt to raise money for repairs. a philadelphia inquirer movie critic,
    however, wrote that every parent''s nightmare is buying a seemingly inanimate
    toy that is actually a psychotic killer. every parent''s nightmare that year was
    also having a car stolen with your child in the back seat (boston globe), having
    a child testify against you in court (miami herald), having a teenager into satan
    and drugs (los angeles times) and van halen''s monsters of rock tour (usa today).
    the following year, people magazine offered that the florida case in which two
    infants were mixed up at the hospital was "every parent''s nightmare come to life."
    the tribune said it was the rap group nwa. the sun-times said no, every parent''s
    nightmare is a family vacation during which your car breaks down in the middle
    of the night in the middle of nowhere shortly after your money has been stolen.
    the miami herald said pedophilia. the philadelphia inquirer said both a 2-year-old
    lion tamer and losing your child in a shopping mall. the boston globe said every
    parent''s nightmare is a child rejecting the family values. usa today said it
    is kevin arnold''s older brother, wayne, from the tv show "the wonder years."
    1990 was also when the miami herald wrote that children with serious genetic abnormalities
    are "every parent''s nightmare," a distinction also afforded that year to evil
    nannies (san francisco chronicle), kidnapped babies (tribune), runaway teens (detroit
    free press) and daughters who date high school dropouts (philadelphia inquirer).
    adolescent suicide was every parent''s nightmare last year, according to the boston
    globe. every person with offspring was also having nightmares about helping his
    child deal with the death of the other parent (newark star ledger), of having
    a teenager badly hurt or killed in an automobile accident (dear abby) and of the
    wedding scene at the end of "the graduate" (tribune). and these are just our garden-variety
    parental nightmares. what are our "worst nightmares"? "a parent''s worst nightmare"
    is having a child suffer massive burns while attempting to roast marshmallows
    (philadelphia inquirer, 1989), having prenatal tests reveal terrible abnormalities
    (tribune, 1987) and a daughter''s first date (sun-times, 1989). it is the violent
    death of a child (los angeles times, 1990), it is a baby''s life-threatening illness
    (philadelphia inquirer, 1991), it is the clothing worn by the rock band nirvana
    (boston globe, 1992). read it and shriek. parents now have more nightmares than
    there are nights, and so are doubling and tripling up. we wake from one only to
    start in on another, trembling, dazed, wrecked. is it any wonder we look the way
    we do?'

    i enjoyed your column on "going home again" and doubt if you can beat this. my
    friend carol and i decided to visit our old neighborhood (we are senior citizens
    now). she very much wanted to see the lovely, large old home she grew up in. we
    drove by slowly, surveying the house, and a very nice-looking lady came out of
    the front door and noticed us. carol then explained that she once lived in that
    house. the woman graciously asked if we cared to see the inside, and of course
    carol was delighted. upon entering the house, we noticed the shocking pink carpet
    and pink satin drapes. several girls were sitting around in negligees. need i
    say more? carol started crying to think that her childhood home had become a house
    of ill repute. the "lady" of the house patted her on the shoulder as if to comfort
    her. i''m surprised she let us in, but she seemed so proud. i doubt if this story
    can be printed, but i thought it was very amusing and a little sad. please don''t

    you said, "once a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient." i disagree. eighteen
    years ago, our oldest son married a girl we liked very much - and i still do.
    i''ll call her sue. six years ago, i gave sue an 18-karat wristwatch. it was appraised
    at $3,000. later, i gave her a fine antique necklace for her 40th birthday. two
    weeks later, my son informed me that he and sue were getting a divorce, and that
    he had already moved out! the divorce was messy. i defended sue and incurred the
    wrath of our son. i should mention that sue and our son had children - my only
    grandchildren - whom i adore, and we all get together at family affairs and are
    most cordial. a few months ago, i asked sue to please return the watch and necklace
    because i wanted them to remain in the family as heirlooms. she flatly refused.
    i know that i would have returned them had i been in her circumstances. please
    tell me, was i wrong to ask sue to return those items? and was she right to refuse?

    if a sitter is going to be at our home during mealtime, we always buy enough food
    for her. here''s the problem: some of these kids act as if they never get a meal
    at home! for example: one sitter ripped through the entire cupboard and fridge,
    trying a little bit of everything, leaving all the packages open. another one
    ate an entire box of snack crackers every time she sat for us. she also ate two
    full bags of potato chips. a third sitter came at 2 p.m. and announced that she
    had not had any lunch. i told her i had not planned on feeding her, so there wasn''t
    much to eat. well, she helped herself to two cans of cream of mushroom soup, a
    half loaf of bread (toast), and a jar of marshmallow creme! i''ve tried talking
    to these kids, leaving notes and hiding the goodies we had bought for entertaining.
    nothing has worked. also, i wonder where my children were when all this mass consumption
    was going on. the last straw was when a sitter sent our children to their rooms
    for a nap (they are 8 and 10) for an hour and a half, while she cleaned out the
    fridge. only after we took her home did we discover she had eaten our dinner and
    wiped out a week''s supply of lunch meat. now what? fed up with feeding them'

    the story about david rice atchison, the alleged "president for a day," is a wonderful
    story. it''s not true, but it''s still a good story. the term of james k. polk''s
    presidency ended at noon on march 4, 1849, and zachary taylor''s term began at
    that time. the fact that taylor did not take the oath until the next day has no
    relevance; the oath doesn''t make a president. if it did, atchison still would
    have no claim to the presidency; he never took the oath! consider this: ninety
    minutes elapsed between the death of john f. kennedy and the oath of lyndon johnson.
    did dean rusk, the secretary of state, become president for 90 minutes? no. george
    bush took the oath at 12:03 p.m. on jan. 20, 1989. did dan quayle serve as president
    for three minutes? i was a schoolteacher for 10 years, and the amount of misinformation
    in the student population was absolutely appalling. we are a nation of people
    who believe abner doubleday invented baseball, henry ford invented the automobile

    every year i begin my 12th-grade geography course by reading an article you printed
    a few years ago. my students are always shocked to learn the statistics that show
    how ignorant many americans are about the world. i was, therefore, surprised and
    dismayed when you placed korea in southeast asia. this shows how pervasive the
    problem is. here''s the article you printed that i use: "dear readers: in celebration
    of its 100th birthday, the national geographic society commissioned gallup-the
    rolls-royce of pollsters-to find out how much the average american knows about
    geography. "the results were startling. one in five of those polled could not
    name one country in europe. three out of four could not find the persian gulf
    on a map. one in four could not find the pacific ocean. one in two couldn''t locate
    south africa. worse yet, 50 percent couldn''t find new york state on a map, and
    14 percent could not even find the united states! "compared with a similar poll
    taken 40 years ago, the results show a steady decrease of geographic knowledge.
    the reason: only 25 percent of the schools in the united states of america include
    geography in their curriculum. "even though there are more americans traveling
    today than ever before, there seems to be a diminishing interest in geography.
    this brings to mind the story about the well-traveled american who called a friend
    to say that she had just returned from majorca. " `where is it?'' the friend asked.
    "she replied, `i don''t know. we flew.'' " respectfully, patrick grant, university
    prep academy, seattle'

    i recently spent four days with my daughter, son-in-law and baby granddaughter,
    11 months old, who live in another state. maybe i''m behind the times, but i would
    like your opinion of the following: my son-in-law works until 11 each night, and
    my daughter feels that the baby should be kept up until he comes home so they
    can have some quality time together. translated, i believe that means that they
    want to sleep late and not be awakened by a hungry baby at 6 or 7 a.m. the baby
    wakes up about 8:30 a.m., is given a bottle and put back in her crib until 10
    or 11 a.m. she is then bathed, dressed and fed breakfast at noon. she has a little
    afternoon nap. lunch is fed to her around 5:30 or 6 p.m. she then takes a nap
    until 8:30 or 9 p.m. she is then awakened, fed supper, plays until her daddy comes
    home, and is put to bed between 11 p.m. and midnight. the baby also suffers from
    non-stop colds. she is adored by both parents and i''m sure will never be abused.
    however, i don''t believe her present eating/sleeping pattern is healthy for her.
    how do you feel about this? my feelings will not be hurt if you tell me it''s
    none of my business. nervous nana'

    this space several years ago, has been the most requested piece to rerun in the
    history of my column. high school and college newspaper editors continue to request
    permission to use it. with easter vacation coming, perhaps parents of teen-agers
    would like to clip this: please, god, i''m only 17 the day i died was an ordinary
    school day. how i wish i had taken the bus. but i was too cool for the bus. i
    remember how i wheedled the car out of mom. "special favor," i pleaded. "all the
    kids drive." when the 2:50 bell rang, i threw all my books in the locker. i was
    free until 8:40 tomorrow morning! i ran to the parking lot, excited at the thought
    of driving a car and being my own boss. free! it doesn''t matter how the accident
    happened. i was goofing off - going too fast. taking crazy chances. but i was
    enjoying my freedom and having fun. the last thing i remember was passing an old
    lady who seemed to be going awfully slow. i heard the deafening crash and felt
    a terrible jolt. glass and steel flew everywhere. my whole body seemed to be turning
    inside out. i heard myself scream. suddenly i awakened; it was very quiet. a police
    officer was standing over me. then i saw a doctor. my body was mangled. i was
    saturated with blood. pieces of jagged glass were sticking out all over. strange
    that i couldn''t feel anything. hey, don''t pull that sheet over my head! i can''t
    be dead. i''m only 17. i''ve got a date tonight. i''m supposed to grow up and
    have a wonderful life. i haven''t lived yet. i can''t be dead. later i was placed
    in a drawer. my folks had to identify me. why did they have to see me like this?
    why did i have to look at mom''s eyes when she faced the most terrible ordeal
    of her life? dad suddenly looked like an old man. he told the man in charge, "yes,
    he is my son." the funeral was a weird experience. i saw all my relatives and
    friends walk toward the casket. they passed by, one by one, and looked at me with
    the saddest eyes i''ve ever seen. some of my buddies were crying. a few of the
    girls touched my hand and sobbed as they walked away. please - somebody - wake
    me up! get me out of here! i can''t bear to see my mom and dad so broken up. my
    grandparents are so racked with grief they can hardly walk. my brothers and sisters
    are like zombies. they move like robots. in a daze, everybody. no one can believe
    this. and i can''t believe it, either. please don''t bury me! i''m not dead! i
    have a lot of living to do! i want to laugh and run again. i want to sing and
    dance. please don''t put me in the ground. i promise if you give me one more chance,
    god, i''ll be the most careful driver in the whole world. all i want is one more
    chance. please, god, i''m only 17! well, dear readers, i am happy to announce

    i am concerned about my wife. i have found books that are very hard-core pornography
    hidden in my home. the books are novels, not picture-type magazines. they describe
    women having sexual encounters with men who come to their door, and similar fantasies.
    i came upon them accidentally. the books are very descriptive and are causing
    me a great deal of concern. i have not mentioned this to my wife since she has
    hidden them from me. i did not go looking for them, but found them under "her"
    side of the bed while i was painting the room during a week of vacation. these
    books cannot be purchased in a regular bookstore, but can be purchased in an adult
    bookstore. we have a very good sex life and do not have any problems other than
    the ordinary problems of money and raising two children for the past 25 years
    that we have been married. i subscribe to playboy magazine, but she reads it and
    it is in our home without being hidden. i thought that we were open with each
    other about issues, but this has thrown me for a loop. she reads these books sometimes
    at night before bed, and as soon as i enter the room, she covers them up and hides
    them. i do not know where else she reads them, but while washing her car, i found
    some when i cleaned the interior. why is she hiding these books from me? why is
    she all of a sudden reading them? what should i do about this? the deception has

    your response to "needing an answer" fell short of the mark. a woman so incredibly
    shallow that she would turn down a date with a gentleman because he had a tooth
    missing needs a new value system - not dental referrals. but assuming you have
    more balanced standards, did you ever consider that the gentleman with the missing
    tooth may not have been able to replace it? a number of years ago, after 20 years
    of struggle - which included repeated pin implants, three crowns, oral surgery,
    major infections and thousands of dollars - a dentist extracted one of my teeth
    because there was nothing left to save or to use as a bed for another crown. the
    adjacent teeth were too weakened from cysts in the jaw to be used as anchors for
    a bridge, and my sinus canal was too low to accommodate an implant. i investigated
    every alternative. i even offered to test experimental procedures. until a solution
    is found, i will count myself fortunate never to have met a man so appallingly
    superficial as to reject me because i have a missing tooth. i''m surprised you
    didn''t give "needing an answer" more mature advice. either that, or suggest she
    become a horse trader, where her ultra-strict criteria would be more appropriate.

    in a recent column, george demian asked you to settle a debate - the thrust of

    by her (dead or alive) husband''s name should be her choice. actually, mrs. john
    doe is not her name; it is her title by virtue of marriage. why isn''t it just

    of mrs., ms., miss or none of the above, for herself or other women, depends upon

    i would like to know your opinion concerning my current relationship with a gentleman
    from portugal. i met him last summer here in the states, and we became instant
    friends. he asked me to go back to portugal with him when he left in august, and
    i willingly accepted his invitation. i spent the best three weeks of my life with
    him in his country. naturally, our friendship turned into a deeper relationship,
    and he came to the states to visit me again for five weeks. we are now back to
    being 3,000 miles apart and writing to each other every week. the phone bills
    are incredible, but he splits mine with me to help me out. my problem is that
    now he wants me to come to portugal over spring break, and again this summer.
    money is the only thing causing me to hesitate. he has offered to pay for my trips,
    but i can''t accept that kind of money from him. he has told me that he will accept
    any reason but money for my refusing to come. he figures there''s no difference
    in his paying to come here, or paying for me to go there. either way, we will
    be together. should i force myself to accept his offer to pay my way? or should
    i insist that he come here? in love and in doubt'

    my husband has been out delivering concert tickets that were sold by telephone

    i have been divorced for eight years. i have one daughter, "jane," who is now
    22. when my husband divorced me, he also divorced our daughter. there was no contact
    with jane, unless she initiated it. no christmas gifts, no birthday gifts, nothing
    - even though she always remembered her father on those occasions. i could not
    understand it; he was a very loving father to jane while she was growing up, but
    the love cooled off after our divorce. jane will be graduating from a private
    college in may. this will be a tremendous relief for me, since i assumed the entire
    financial burden of her college education. (i suggested he share the expense,
    but he flatly refused.) i am not wealthy by any means. i had to mortgage my house
    and secure a personal loan to cover jane''s tuition and living expenses. my ex
    is not a pauper. he makes in the neighborhood of $100,000 a year, but he lives
    well, pays an ex-wife alimony, and he''s keeping another woman. i nearly hit the
    ceiling when jane told me she intends to invite her father to her graduation!
    i reminded her that i was the one who had made all the sacrifices, and i should
    not have to share her graduation day with her father, who practically disowned
    her these last eight years. jane says i have no right to take that attitude, and
    regardless of who paid for her college education, he is still her father, and
    she wants him to see her get her diploma. i will leave it to you, abby. who is
    right? jane''s mother'

    "jim" and i were married last october. after our honeymoon, we opened all the

    thought standing up for us at our wedding was enough. she also mentioned that

    i never thought i would be writing you, but i am so angry i have to vent, or i
    will explode! i have a very close male friend of more than 30 years. we have no
    secrets and have shared wonderful experiences and trips together. "jim" is openly
    gay. for decades i begged (and even tried to bribe) him to give up cigarettes,
    but to no avail. he pleaded hopeless addiction and refrained from smoking in front
    of me. abby, about a month ago, jim suddenly gave up smoking. i asked him if it
    was on doctor''s orders, and he said, "no, i just don''t feel like smoking." then,
    a few weeks ago, i saw him and he looked absolutely green. he was breathless,
    as though he had been running, and said he felt just terrible. i told him he didn''t
    look too well, either, and urged him to see his doctor. to make a long story short,
    he paid a visit to the doctor, who ordered him immediately into the hospital.
    the diagnosis is pneumocystic pneumonia. abby, i am furious with him! when all
    the publicity about aids came out 10 years ago, he told me he hadn''t had contact
    with anybody in ages. and over the years, as mutual friends became sick, i asked
    him if he had been tested for aids. he just repeated that he hadn''t been near
    anybody in almost 10 years and, if he was hiv-positive, he would rather not know
    it. how could anybody be so selfish? how could he have had so little consideration
    for the people who love him? if he cared so little for his own health, couldn''t
    he have at least made sure he was all right for my sake, and for the other friends
    who treasure him as i do? i am heartbroken. if he had only confirmed he was hiv-positive,
    he and his doctor could have monitored his immune system, and he would have had
    advance warning that he was in serious trouble. instead, he wasted precious weeks.
    the doctors think they can pull him through this episode - but what if they can''t?
    this is so unfair! why, oh, why would an intelligent person who knows he is at
    risk refuse to be tested when it is so important that people know their status?

    i am a 30-year-old, happily married woman. last week my husband was out of town
    on business. before he left, without my knowledge, he arranged for a contractor
    to repair our chimney. anyway, i decided to spend the morning housecleaning. sometimes,
    in the privacy of my home, i do my housework in the nude, but i make sure my drapes
    are drawn. this was such a time. after an hour or so, i thought i heard a scratching
    on the roof - then the skylight in our family room came crashing down! almost
    scared to death, i ran to the area and saw this contractor staring at me - with
    severely lacerated hands. it turns out that this contractor had come to our house
    early that morning and was starting to do his work on our chimney when he looked
    through the skylight and saw me. interested, he was pressing against the glass
    skylight hoping for a better view when the accident occurred. (this was the story
    he told our insurance man.) to make a long story short, the contractor did sustain
    a serious injury, and now he is making a claim against our insurance company.
    i think he has a lot of nerve. he admits that he was staring at me for at least
    half an hour. i wonder how this man''s wife would feel if she knew the full details?

    she was nude? mutual friends have told me that he described my nudity in detail

    brother hates sleeping with his mother, but that she threatens to spank him if
    he sleeps in his own bedroom. harold has tried talking to his mother about this,
    but she is very irrational and suffers bouts of depression. my mother does not

    my husband and i are planning to renew our wedding vows on our 10th anniversary,
    but we don''t know where to start. our first wedding was such a rush and poorly
    organized. here are some questions: 1. how do we walk down the aisle? individually
    or as a couple? how about the best man and the bridesmaid, etc.? 2. do we exchange
    rings again - also, does the best man carry the rings? 3. can we send out as many
    invitations as we want to? how do we write them, and when should they be mailed?
    4. about my gown: i would like to wear velvet. where can i buy one, or have one
    made? or will a bridal shop do it to my satisfaction? 5. what are the colors i
    can use? my original color was lavender - may i change the color? 6. could i possibly
    change my wedding date to the summer instead of having it in december? 7. we never
    had a honeymoon. we would love to go to hawaii, but my husband will not travel
    on a plane. what should we do? 8. what does a travel agency really do? can they
    help cut costs? do they give estimates for free? our anniversary is a year from
    now, but i know the time will go very fast. i will really appreciate any help
    you can give me. our wedding was in december because a baby was due in february.

    my brother and his wife are very staunch believers in their religion. last year
    their church had their 14-year-old son send out letters to not only friends, neighbors
    and relatives, but to friends and relatives of his grandparents as well. the letters
    requested a $100 donation to help send this boy to a two-month religious camp
    in europe to help spread the word. to say that we were aghast is to put it mildly.
    everyone felt that if his parents wanted him to have this training, they should
    foot the bill themselves. (they can well afford it.) my parents told my brother
    that they don''t approve of this begging, and it''s embarrassing to have their
    neighbors and relatives approached. well, my brother ignored their wishes, and
    this year their son has sent letters again - this time for a two-month religious
    retreat in colorado! is there a tactful way to end this begging without causing
    a serious rift in the family? aghast'

    silver salad fork was missing. i looked through my garbage to make sure i had
    not accidentally discarded it. it was nowhere to be found. this is the second

    of pride. it could be that i am poor, have always been poor, and probably will
    always be poor, unless i hit the lottery. when i had teeth, i took care of them
    (no neglect); when they got cavities and needed fillings, it was cheaper to have
    them pulled - so it wasn''t ignorance; it was lack of money. pride? what is pride
    - combing your hair to cover a bald spot? having silicone implants to make your
    breasts bigger? bull. if god wants me to have teeth, he will make them grow back.
    or maybe you will send my dentist the $1,000 he wants up front to make me a bridge.
    i am 68 and can eat what i want and have been married for 33 years, so i am not
    looking for a new girlfriend. true, i would probably look better when i smile
    if i had more teeth, but be assured that it is the lack of money - not lack of
    pride - that''s standing in my way. roy l. park, seattle'

    the letter from "anonymous merchant," who complained about thoughtless people
    who walk into his store and don''t even say hello, reminded me of my situation.
    i am a woman who uses a wheelchair, and i would like to remind people that i am
    still a person. some suggestions: 1. please, say hello to me. i am not just a
    wheelchair. 2. make sure i can get through your door. many times, i would like
    to cross your threshold, but your door is heavier than i can open. 3. please remember
    that merchandise placed on shelves out of my reach limits my choices. 4. please
    provide a dressing room that my wheelchair can enter. almost every store has one
    spacious dressing room that is the favorite of nearly all your customers. 5. please
    talk to me, not to the person who is with me. a typical experience: at a recent
    visit to a resort hotel, we entered one of the shops and the salesperson asked
    my husband, "is your wife looking for something?" and on a plane, the flight attendant
    asked my husband, "and what will the lady have?" 6. please do not try to "help
    me" without asking, "may i assist you?" thank you, abby, for listening to me and
    all the other people in the u.s.a. and canada who use wheelchairs. norma in bothell,
    wash.'

    i went to the grocery store today and my purchases came to $8.21, so i gave the
    cashier one $5 bill, three $1 bills, a quarter and a penny. the cashier looked
    puzzled. then she said, "i have to give you something back, don''t i? how much
    am i supposed to give you?" abby, i had to tell her i wanted a nickel back. she
    said she was new on the job and wasn''t used to making change. this is not the
    first time i''ve had to tell a cashier how much change to give me. some cash registers
    are so sophisticated nowadays, the cashiers don''t have to know how to add 2 and
    2. i am not against progress, but when a college graduate can''t add a column
    of four figures without running for a calculator, something is wrong. a fellow
    who does volunteer work with me is a graduate of a college in iowa. he asked me
    how many "j''s" there are in "emergency"! little kids can''t even tell time on
    an old-fashioned watch with numbers because most watches are digital now. i am
    63 years old, but i think american technology has come too far too fast. i''m
    no old fogey, but i don''t want a machine to do all my thinking for me. what do
    you say, abby? "doc" in faribault, minn.'
