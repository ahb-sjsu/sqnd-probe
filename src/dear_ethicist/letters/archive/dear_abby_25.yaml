  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my husband and i have always made it a priority to spend time with the people
    in our lives we care for. at this stage, our children are gone and our large home
    is ideal for gatherings, so we are frequent hosts to friends and family. one of
    our close friends, "gloria," has a roommate, "ivy," who has taken it upon herself
    to show up at any event she hears about without being invited. this has put gloria
    in the uncomfortable position of being the "informant." in most cases, it wouldn''t
    present a problem. however, ivy has shown up at sit-down dinners with limited
    seating. she never offers to bring anything or calls to make sure she''s welcome.
    sometimes she shows up earlier than when our guests have been told to arrive.
    this has caused some awkward situations for me, to put it mildly. not only that,
    but ivy is a very demanding guest. on a few occasions she has tried to boss me
    around and expects me to wait on her hand and foot. how can we tactfully tell
    this woman she needs to call before showing up to make sure she''s welcome? --

    i need to know if my husband''s relationship with his ex-wife should be tolerated.
    they talk to each other on the phone every month or so, and send each other cards

    i went into our home office and noticed that my wife had left her e-mail on. i
    spotted an odd name, so i opened one of the messages and my jaw dropped. it was
    from a man with whom my wife was having an affair. the e-mails were so graphic
    as to leave nothing to the imagination. this person is someone with whom my wife
    had an affair before we got together. he was going to leave his wife and live
    with her before we met, but when push came to shove, he stayed with his wife and
    just used mine for sex. one of the messages discussed a planned meeting that did
    not take place -- only because he got stuck at work. she e-mailed him and told
    him he could stop by the house any night after 10 and have sex for an hour or
    two because our 5-year-old son and i were sleeping in other bedrooms! she insists
    that "nothing happened," which i have trouble believing. we have been seeing a

    i disagree with your answer to the woman who doesn''t like to drive at night,

    he should use a car service and charge it as a business expense. why should she

    my beloved husband passed away in early october, leaving a hobby cabinet filled
    with expensive items. it had never been kept locked. the keys were always left
    hanging in the lock. the day before the visitation at the funeral home, my son
    quietly locked the cabinet, pocketed the keys and took them with him. the next
    day, my husband''s brother told me what my son had done and expressed concern
    about his intentions regarding the contents of the cabinet as well as the expensive
    hobby items in my husband''s workroom. i was shocked and upset. i felt my son
    had violated the privacy of my home by locking the cabinet and leaving with the
    keys. therefore, i called him and told him i wanted them returned the next day.
    my son began crying and saying, "mom, why are you doing this to me?" i was perplexed
    then and remain perplexed as to how he thought i was doing anything "to him" inasmuch
    as it was he who had locked me out of a cabinet in my own home. i felt then, and
    continue to feel, that i had every right to tell him i wanted the keys back. a
    few days later, my son told me he was "crushed, crushed!" by my request. my son''s
    wife is an attorney. she sees nothing wrong with what my son did, and in fact,
    has criticized me for my remarks about his "secreting the keys from my home."

    my husband and i were married in a small, intimate ceremony and reception in 2004.
    we were living in a condominium complex and had become close friends with one
    of our neighbors and her boyfriend, so we invited them to our wedding. afterward,
    i opened their card. it read: "we are happy to share your day with you, but we
    are strapped for money right now and can''t afford a gift at this time. as soon
    as we''re back on our feet, we''ll make sure you get your wedding gift." we are
    now invited to their wedding. we never did receive a gift from them, nor has it
    ever been mentioned. these neighbors have a history of being "cheap," so it''s
    not the first time. my husband and i are at odds. i think we should attend the
    wedding and buy them a nice gift. he says we should just give them a card with
    no gift. or should we simply not attend at all? i know that wedding gifts are
    just that -- gifts. but i''d feel strange not giving them anything. i would also
    feel strange giving them anything under the circumstances. how should we handle
    this? -- miffed in montana'

    the "smiths" and our family live on either side of "betty," an 84-year-old widow.
    betty is a wonderful, caring neighbor most of the time. however, she is beginning
    to deteriorate mentally and physically. she has a cleaning service that comes
    in, a teenager to mow her lawn and a medicalert necklace, but she has problems
    grasping and remembering the major things that need to be done outside her home
    as well as setting up her medication regimen. betty''s son lives 250 miles away,
    but he visits only a couple of times a year. he arrives late one day, stays the
    next two nights, and leaves early the third morning. her other children live in
    other states and rarely visit. betty is beginning to rely more and more on us
    neighbors to get things done for her. while we don''t mind helping out in emergencies,
    we feel someone else should take over her everyday needs. she is adamant about
    not going to a nursing home -- which i agree with -- but there are less-confining
    possibilities that i think would be better for her and would relieve us of the
    responsibility and liability of tending to her. should we contact her son, or

    i am 21 and my girlfriend, "jody," is 19. the other day she was invited to a party
    at which she told me she intended to smoke marijuana. she knows i disapprove of
    drugs and alcohol. when i became upset, she told me to "lighten up." i love jody
    with all my heart and want nothing bad to happen to her, so i wrote an anonymous
    letter to her mother explaining the situation. jody didn''t get into trouble,
    but her brother did because he had marijuana on him at the time. because i told
    her mother what was going to happen, nobody was able to do what they intended
    at the party. now they''re all mad at me. i have been getting hate messages on
    my answering machine and via e-mail. jody promised to call me before the party,
    but she didn''t and went anyway. i visited her at work and tried to talk with
    her, but she isn''t speaking to me. i have apologized countless times, saying
    i didn''t mean for anyone to get in trouble. i love her more than anything, but

    my husband and i have been married almost 22 years and are happily child-free.
    we have always lived far from our relatives and see them only every three or four
    years. at a recent gathering of my husband''s siblings, his oldest sister (now
    a grandmother) was extremely aggressive in her insistence that we hold, kiss and
    interact with her 11-day-old grandchild (her latest). when we attempted to rebuff
    her with humor, saying, "oh, we just don''t do babies!" she became hostile and
    insulting. it made us both very uncomfortable. because of this, we are now considering
    skipping any future visits because her behavior will undoubtedly be repeated.
    i don''t want bad blood in the family. however, i refuse to be treated with disrespect.
    should we confront the sister and let her know how her behavior made us feel?

    i have lived next door to the "smiths" for 18 years. they''re nice people. when
    problems have arisen, they have helped me out, and i have done the same for them.
    we''re good neighbors and friends. i have known the smiths'' children their whole
    lives. their daughter is now 17. their son was born a year later. my question:
    is it normal for a 16-year-old boy to walk around the house naked, in plain view
    of family members? no one seems to notice or care. there are no looks or comments.
    in the morning he gets up around 6:45. he walks into the kitchen and fixes a bowl
    of cereal. then he stands at the counter, watching the morning sports shows while
    eating his breakfast in the nude. there is absolutely no evidence of arousal of
    any kind. when the bathroom becomes available, he goes in for a shower. i have
    never seen any of the other family members naked. this boy has no compunctions
    about being seen by his father, mother, sister or next-door neighbor. he''s been
    nude in my presence dozens of times. i know it''s common for little boys to run
    around without clothes on sometimes, but, abby, he''s not a little boy anymore.

    tell them that i will need to charge them for it because the ingredients are expensive.

    while my daughter and i were at the supermarket, we ran into santa at the deli!
    you can''t imagine my daughter''s surprise -- not to mention my own. there he
    was, with his perfect bowling ball head and full white beard. he had a jolly big
    belly, rosy cheeks, even small square wire-framed glasses. he wasn''t dressed
    in his traditional holiday outfit; he was casually dressed. my daughter, who is
    9, had started having serious doubts about santa last year, but she sure does
    believe now. she ran up to him and said, "i knew it! i knew you were real! where''s
    your sleigh? where''s your reindeer?" the man winked at me, looked down at my
    daughter and said, "sweetheart, they''re at the north pole. i''m in the area checking
    things out before christmas." then he asked her if she had been a good girl. when
    she said yes, he advised her to write him a letter. it was wonderful. i know some
    people don''t believe, and i know some feel it is technically lying to children,
    and not everyone shares the same religious beliefs. i respect their right to celebrate
    the holidays in their own way. i grew up poor. i knew when christmas morning came
    it would be no different than the year before on christmas day -- there would
    be nothing. i missed out on so many wonderful things in my childhood. like many
    parents, i want my kids to have the childhood i didn''t have. i studied hard,
    got a good education, met a wonderful man and married. we have two beautiful daughters,
    9 and 11. we''re not rich, but we''re comfortable and don''t want for much. every
    christmas, my children and i go to the local mall and visit the orphan tree. each
    of them chooses an orphan and buys him or her whatever is on his/her list. i explained
    when they were younger that sometimes even santa needs a helping hand. i also
    point out how fortunate they are -- and when you are fortunate, you must give
    something back. to you and your readers: whether you choose to believe or not
    -- i wish you happy holidays. -- still a believer in ohio'

  body: 'dear readers: yesterday i printed the feedback i received regarding a letter
    from "smothered in michigan," a recently divorced mother of two. her ex-husband
    had been an alcoholic. she''s now dating his "polar opposite" who "treats her
    like a queen" and is "loving, affectionate, generous and caring." she went on
    to say he stops by her job "only a few" times a day, and the minute she''s home
    he shows up at her door. all her dinners are with him -- he pays for everything
    -- and he doesn''t leave until her kids go to bed. he spends every waking hour
    with her and accompanies her wherever she goes. she said she knows she should
    feel grateful, but instead feels "indebted, stalked, controlled and burdened."
    her question: "am i just being selfish, and can i train myself to like being spoiled?"
    i told her she and the man were overdue for a frank talk about personal space,
    that she''s still healing from her divorce, and he seems so smitten or insecure
    that he''s preventing her from figuring out where she ends and he begins. many
    readers felt she should listen to her intuition, that the man is a potential abuser,
    and the traits she listed are red flags. today i''ll share the classic warning
    signs of an abuser. read on: (1) pushes for quick involvement: comes on strong,
    claiming, "i''ve never felt loved like this by anyone." an abuser presses for
    an exclusive commitment almost immediately. (2) jealous: excessively possessive;
    calls constantly or visits unexpectedly; prevents you from going to work because
    "you might meet someone"; checks the mileage on your car. (3) controlling: interrogates
    you intensely (especially if you''re late) about whom you talked to and where
    you were; keeps all the money; insists you ask permission to go anywhere or do
    anything. (4) unrealistic expectations: expects you to be the perfect mate and
    meet his or her every need. (5) isolation: tries to cut you off from family and
    friends; accuses people who are your supporters of "causing trouble." the abuser
    may deprive you of a phone or car, or try to prevent you from holding a job. (6)
    blames others for problems or mistakes: it''s always someone else''s fault if
    something goes wrong. (7) makes others responsible for his or her feelings: the
    abuser says, "you make me angry," or "you''re hurting me by not doing what i tell
    you." (8) hypersensitivity: is easily insulted, claiming hurt feelings when he
    or she is really mad. rants about the injustice of things that are just a part
    of life. (9) cruelty to animals or children: kills or punishes animals brutally.
    also may expect children to do things that are far beyond their ability (whips
    a 3-year-old for wetting a diaper) or may tease them until they cry. sixty-five
    percent of abusers who beat their partner will also abuse children. (10) "playful"
    use of force during sex: enjoys throwing you down or holding you against your
    will during sex; finds the idea of rape exciting. (11) verbal abuse: constantly
    criticizes or says blatantly cruel things; degrades, curses, calls you ugly names.
    this may also involve sleep deprivation, waking you with relentless verbal abuse.
    (12) rigid gender roles: expects you to serve, obey and remain at home. (13) sudden
    mood swings: switches from sweet to violent in minutes. (14) past battering: admits
    to hitting a mate in the past, but says the person "made" him (or her) do it.
    (15) threats of violence: says things like, "i''ll break your neck," or "i''ll
    kill you," then dismisses them with "everybody talks that way," or "i didn''t
    really mean it."'

    i was the other woman for seven years, involved with a man i thought was perfect.
    his wife knew about me. it was never an issue until he fell in love with me. after
    that, things changed. he began making promises and told me as soon as his wife
    got herself together and found a job and a place to live, he''d divorce her and
    be with me forever. two years became three, three became five. finally i realized
    he''d never do what he promised, so i ended it. the problem is, he''s my boss.
    he was my best friend, and i still had some hope. we see each other every day
    because of work, although i am considered an independent contractor. a year after
    i called it quits he finally filed for divorce. a few months later he met this
    new woman. he says he loves her, but i still hurt. every day is another day of
    holding back my tears, another day to hide my pain. today i met a woman who is
    a member of a group i belong to. she mentioned she knows a man who would be "perfect"
    for me. she said they had dated a few times over the years. abby, the number she
    gave me was his. while we were together he was seeing this other woman! i am devastated.

    i was hired about a month ago at a biotech firm as a logistics coordinator, basically
    doing a little of everything -- shipping, arranging travel, etc. i put a lot of
    hard work into every assignment i was given and, as a result, was moved into the
    marketing department last week and given a more defined position with a greater
    workload. my title is "marketing coordinator." when i had more time, i didn''t
    mind covering the occasional shift for the receptionist when needed. but now i
    am asked to do it on a nearly daily basis, sometimes with little or no notice.
    i politely informed the receptionist that i had more work to do now and could
    not always cover, and she drew up a schedule that has me covering one hour a week.
    the beef i have is that no other new hires are being asked to cover. i feel i''m
    being taken advantage of because i am young and female, and if i don''t put my
    foot down now, early in my career, i''ll be continually taken advantage of. what

    brother is with a lady who has two children from a previous union. the kids call
    my parents "papa" and "nana" and get upset about being excluded from the photos.
    their moms feel the same. when it happened two years ago, my brother said that
    if she did it again he would say something. i know i should have talked to marian
    and told her not to single out the children, but i didn''t want to be put on the

    little support, financially or emotionally. in fact, earl has stolen from both
    of my daughters (it was identity theft) and ran up thousands of dollars in bills,
    not to mention the unpaid medical expenses and child support. courtney and her
    fiance''s family were scheduled to stay at our house for a few days prior to the
    wedding. one week before they were scheduled to come, courtney informed me that
    she wanted to "establish a new relationship" with her father and his side of the
    family. being already emotional about the wedding, i flipped out. i didn''t understand
    how she could do this to me and her stepdad after all our years of picking up
    the pieces. courtney told me to "stuff it" and did as she pleased. her new in-laws

    i have a problem with a flirtatious neighbor. my fiance, "ron," and i are building
    a new home, and every time we go to check on the progress, our neighbors, the
    "smiths," come over to talk. mr. smith seems ok, but his wife stares, smiles and
    touches ron. she has even stated that ron must like older women -- meaning me,
    although we''re about the same age. she does this in the presence of her husband.
    what should i say to mrs. smith? i hate to move into a new home only to dread
    our neighbors coming around, but she makes me very uncomfortable. please help.

    i''m only 16, but i want to ask my parents if i could start seeing a therapist.

    has been causing me. my problem is approaching my parents about it. i have been
    depressed for months, but admitting it to them would be embarrassing. i''m afraid

    is it all right for a family member to eavesdrop on a conversation on the extension

  body: 'dear readers: thanksgiving dishes are back in the china cabinet, and the
    last of the leftovers are finished. the party season is starting, and christmas
    carols fill the air. while this is an exciting and joyful time for a lot of us,
    for many individuals the holidays can be an intensely difficult time, triggering
    feelings of stress, loneliness and loss. if a person is prone to depression, these
    feelings can be magnified. how can anyone feel depressed at this time of year,
    you ask? the reasons are many: people who are separated from their families often
    feel isolated because they are unable to celebrate in the traditional way. families
    who have lost a loved one during the year often feel his or her absence especially
    at this time. others become depressed because they imagine that everyone else
    is enjoying a warm, idealized family experience, while they are on the outside
    looking in. even people who enjoy the holidays can find them stressful. at this
    time of year people are stretched for time, energy and money - - particularly
    the latter. they may feel embarrassed because they can''t celebrate the way they
    would like to, or celebrate in the style they have in years past. some ways to
    ward off the holiday blues: -- keep expectations reasonable. do not take on more
    activities than you can comfortably handle -- financially or otherwise. -- don''t
    overspend. plan a holiday budget and live within it, regardless of the temptation.
    -- do not run up credit card debt, or january will be like a serious hangover.
    -- and speaking of hangovers: watch your alcohol intake. remember, although alcohol
    appears to be a mood elevator, it is actually a depressant. if you have a problem
    with alcohol, get whatever support you need to make it through the holidays. and
    finally, if you are feeling down and in need of an instant "upper," the surest
    way to accomplish it is to do something nice for someone else. call someone who
    lives alone and invite that person to dinner. better yet, say, "i''m coming to
    get you, and i''ll see that you get safely home." (some older people no longer
    drive at night, and those who do might prefer not to be behind the wheel after
    dark.) give it a try! you''ll be glad you did. and another reminder: we have so
    much for which to be grateful -- our health, our sanity, our freedom. for those
    of you with a little time to spare, how about showing our gratitude to our wounded
    veterans by visiting a veteran''s hospital and raising the spirits of those who
    have served our country? as i said before, the quickest way to lose those holiday
    blues is to extend a hand to someone who could use one. try it and you''ll see
    what i mean. love, abby'

    i am a retired pediatric dentist who frequently treated children other dentists
    couldn''t manage or preferred not to. one rule in my office was that no child
    would ever leave without being complimented, regardless of how he or she had behaved
    during the appointment -- even if it meant saying, "you''re the best spitter we''ve
    had all day!" of course, we were absolutely sincere in our compliments. one day
    a woman called to make an emergency appointment for her 5-year-old grandson, pete.
    i learned that the little boy''s 17-year-old mother had run away when he was an
    infant. his father (the grandparents'' son) was in prison serving a 30-year-to-life
    sentence. that left this elderly couple to raise the child. my staff told her
    to bring him in immediately. when they arrived, pete was understandably nervous
    and fussy when my assistant brought him back into the operatory, but he soon quieted
    down. i gave him a hug and began treatment to relieve his infection and pain.
    when i finished, i complimented him and asked that his grandmother come in so
    i could explain what i had done. as we chatted, pete was happily picking out a
    little toy from the drawer. we scheduled a follow-up appointment for one week
    later. the following week, 20 minutes before his appointment, the door burst open
    and little pete came running in looking for an operatory chair to sit in. i escorted
    him back to reception and told him we''d call him in a few minutes. the second
    appointment went equally well. he was smiling and happy. i spoke with his grandmother
    again as he once more chose a little gift. then she said: "i still can''t believe
    it. every morning this week pete jumped out of bed and asked if this was the day
    he''d come back to see you! i''d have to tell him ''no, not for another five days,
    then four days, three, etc.'' this morning he was so excited when i told him this
    was the day he was coming in." then she continued, "do you know why he was so
    eager to come back?" "no," i replied, "please tell me." "because," she answered,
    "you told him he was a good boy." abby, here was a 5-year-old child who had never
    been told he was a good boy! i still tear up when i think about it. -- (dr.) r.c.

    i have been dating "leon" for a few months. he is smart, cute, ambitious, caring,
    a great kisser and has a fantastic sense of humor. the problem? he gives new meaning
    to the phrase, "got milk?" leon still has the remains of the first gallon of milk
    he ever purchased when he moved into his apartment. (he had overestimated the
    amount of milk he would consume, and before he knew it, had a gallon in his fridge
    that was three weeks past its expiration date.) time passed, and still it remained
    there. soon it was 6 months old and a novelty. abby, leon has kept this container
    of milk through two roommates, three girlfriends, seven jobs and two refrigerators.
    it will soon be five years. he seems to have formed some sort of sentimental attachment
    to it. can it still be classified as -- milk? leon is entertained by the reaction
    he gets when people hear about it, and even has a blog about it with a picture.
    if our relationship is to get serious, i see a "me or the milk" ultimatum in our
    future. is it asking too much for him to leave his life of keeping expired dairy,
    or should i cut my losses and seek a dairy-free bachelor? or should i just accept
    it as a souvenir or a pet? -- lactose intolerant in oregon'

    several months ago, my 35-year-old sister met a man online. after corresponding
    (via telephone and e-mail) for about two weeks, she moved two states away to move
    in with him. she never saw a picture of him and had never met him in person before
    she moved to be with him. this man -- i believe he''s 45 -- now wants to communicate
    with my 14-year-old daughter. he tries to chat with her online and doesn''t understand
    why i think it is inappropriate. he says he''s "family" now, and i am being overprotective.
    abby, am i being overprotective of my daughter? i have never met or spoken to
    this man and feel he has no right to communicate with my daughter. please help.

    i have been seeing a very nice man for about four months. he lives with his 23-year-old
    daughter. he loves when i cook for him, and when he asks me to cook i do it because
    i enjoy it as a creative outlet. but every time i make a dish, his daughter comes
    along and adds things to it. i was making sunday gravy, and she added something
    to that. another time, i was making pasta primavera, and she poured a can of beans
    into it. i am a very good cook, abby. i do not need any help in the kitchen. how

    would you allow me to add to your letters sharing acts of kindness? my husband
    was deployed to iraq for a year. close to the time of his return, i went to some
    businesses in our community to ask if they would put welcome home messages in
    their windows or on their marquees. the responses i got were incredible! an eye
    doctor even offered to give our family free eye exams and glasses/contacts if
    they were needed. a chiropractor offered to give my husband a free adjustment.
    i was overwhelmed with the support my family was given, as was my husband when,

    my husband, "cal," and i have decided to have thanksgiving at our house this year.

    my brother "wilbur" is supposedly bipolar and hasn''t held a job for more than
    six months at a crack. he is going to be 48 years old. in between jobs, he ran
    to our parents for financial help. when dad was around, he could control it somewhat.
    but dad is gone now, so mom is giving all this money to wilbur. mom was recently
    diagnosed with alzheimer''s, so how do we stop this nonsense? wilbur won''t quit
    demanding money. i think mom is afraid not to give it to him because she thinks
    he''ll go wacko. wilbur doesn''t have a permanent address because he''s in and
    out of homeless shelters, so we can''t get a restraining order. please help, because
    this is stressing our family out. mom needs to know that she owes wilbur nothing,
    and it''s ok to turn him out of her home and cut off the funding. i know a power
    of attorney will do the trick, but how do you make a person realize that her son
    is a con artist and is just abusing her? for 27 years i have argued with mom over
    all that she has given wilbur. in her final years, i''d like to enjoy our time

    i was going to a hair salon about five times a year to have my hair cut and styled.
    a few months back, the owner, who had always cut my hair, went out on maternity
    leave, so another stylist cut my hair. i mentioned to her that, as i have gotten
    older, my hair has thinned, that i hated how it looked and didn''t know how to
    cut it anymore. she gave me a beautiful cut. when the owner returned, i asked
    her to follow the cut, but she didn''t do it exactly, and refused to ask the woman
    who had done it how it was done. when it was time for my next haircut, i called
    and asked the stylist to cut my hair again, but she hesitated. her reply was,
    "if my son isn''t sick." abby, the appointment i was scheduling was two weeks
    away. i "got the message," and i am now patronizing another salon. i thought beauty
    salons were a business and not just about "i saw you first!" is there some unwritten
    rule in the beauty business that whoever cuts your hair when you first got there
    is your stylist forever? i''m unhappy now, and they lost a customer. who wins?

    my husband and i have a 5-year-old and a 9-month-old -- both boys. they are incredibly
    sweet, well-behaved, beautiful children. my problem is how people relate to the

    on to say, "he looks like the gerber baby." i appreciate their compliments, but
    they often ignore our 5-year-old. he is also a darling child, but because he''s
    so well-behaved, too often people don''t give him a second glance. when we''re
    at home i make sure to give him plenty of compliments about a variety of things,
    including his behavior, his eating habits and helpfulness. i don''t want his feelings
    hurt when people go overboard with the baby. is there anything i can say when

    but he always knuckles under to the guilt trip from his mother. he says that until
    he graduates from college, he has to live by their rules, but i think their rules

    i am writing about a new trend i have been seeing. it has become commonplace for
    parents to call their teenage children from the car at the curb when picking them
    up from a friend''s house. i realize this saves time, but i am concerned that
    today''s parents do not do the necessary "legwork" in meeting their children''s
    friends and their friends'' parents, checking to see if an adult will be on the
    premises and observing the general home situation that their child will be visiting.
    i am amazed at parents who drop off their teens to spend the night and never bother
    to come to the door. i also see this tendency in the young people themselves.

    i''m the mother of a daughter with down syndrome. there have often been situations

    this can be a teaching/learning moment for both her son and the other boy. many
    children with developmental disabilities are mainstreamed with regular education
    children in school. kids with down syndrome need to be taught proper social skills
    so they can have a relationship with their peers. if children with down syndrome

    eight years ago, while visiting my son, "jack," and his wife, "mary," in a nearby
    state, i saw a few dishes in the sink waiting to be washed -- so i washed them.
    when mary saw what i had done, she became upset. she said, "i don''t keep house
    the way you do." my reply at the time was that i was only trying to be helpful.
    that was all the cleaning i did -- i swear. a few years later, when they visited
    me, mary vacuumed, scrubbed floors and cleaned out my refrigerator -- all without
    asking me or being asked to do so. when jack noticed this unusual activity and
    questioned it, mary replied, "she cleaned at our house when she visited us." how
    do i handle such a long-held resentment without damaging my son''s and my own
    relationship? i have never been invited to stay at their home since. jack does
    visit me alone, and the two of them stop by on their way to other vacation spots.
    mary''s latest ploy is to be very "concerned" about jack driving such a long way
    by himself to visit me. they plan to be here in about six weeks. i need to confer
    with my son about my private finances, house repairs, and show him needed chores
    that i can no longer do myself. this house will be his to dispose of at my death.

    i left "harold," my husband of 24 years, in 2002. the youngest of our four children
    had just turned 16. harold had been abusive for years, but i lacked the confidence
    to leave because i had four children to care for and nowhere to go. a couple of
    months after our divorce was final, i remarried. one of the things my new husband,
    "pete," and i agreed on was that we would relocate to his hometown, 300 miles
    away, once he retired. pete retired last summer, and we moved a couple of months
    ago. my children, who have all left home, say they miss me. but my oldest daughter
    has real issues with it. she''s 24, unmarried, and living with her boyfriend and
    their 20-month-old daughter. she needs help with her daughter, but is not willing
    to come here. i am not willing to leave pete and go back there. i stayed with
    harold for too many years caring for her and her siblings. i think i have earned
    the right to live my own life now without feeling guilty. my daughter was just
    "having fun" when she accidentally became pregnant -- yet she acts like i should
    pay for her mistake. i need a way to tell her that she must figure out how to
    live her own life and raise her daughter on her own. i don''t want to offend her

    my hairdresser, "natasha," owns the shop where i have had my hair done for more
    than 15 years. i love the way she does my hair. natasha obliges me when i can''t
    come for my regular appointment, and i am always generous with my tip. the problem
    is, she can''t handle money. because i''m a longtime customer, natasha feels she
    can tell me her money troubles. every time i''m there, it''s a steady stream of
    woe. over the years i have seen her jump into one harebrained scheme after another,
    losing thousands along with way. she''s always in trouble with the bank, creditors,
    etc. natasha''s latest problem is that her credit cards are all maxed out, and
    she can''t afford her home or meet her payroll. i have gently tried explaining
    that her employees must be paid regardless, because they, too, have obligations.
    i have also urged her to meet with her bank manager, get counseling help, and
    contact the credit card companies to arrange payments. so far, she has not taken
    my advice, and her sad tales continue to unfold. abby, i go to get my hair done
    and relax -- not to hear her misery. i am now thinking about taking my business
    elsewhere. my husband agrees, and so does my daughter (a psychologist). but our
    son, a businessman, disagrees. he says if natasha gives good service, why not
    be like a bartender and listen to her troubles? my husband thinks natasha is getting
    ready to ask me to bail her out. i don''t want to be put in that position. she''s
    the type who, if her money problems were wiped out today, would be back tomorrow.
    that''s what has happened all along. she''s a fine hairdresser; she just has poor

    my younger brother died unexpectedly two years ago. he was only 27. since then,
    my parents have befriended his close friends. there are two couples, the "smiths,"
    who have a baby they named after my brother (my parents are his godparents), and
    the "joneses" (bill jones was my brother''s best friend growing up). my parents
    want to invite them to every holiday dinner or event we have. my husband and i
    host the dinners at our home because it''s larger than my parents'' and we enjoy
    entertaining. the problem is, the smiths and the joneses are inconsiderate guests.
    they are always late -- an hour or more -- and my mother always wants to wait
    for them! they eat, run, and barely talk to my husband. sometimes they fail to
    show up without even a phone call. (also, they never offer to help or bring anything.)
    my parents are very forgiving and do not seem offended by it, even though they
    know i was very annoyed at the last holiday dinner and said so. my husband says
    we will no longer host any holiday dinners if the smiths and joneses are coming.
    i agree with my husband and couldn''t care less if these "friends" attend. however,
    i don''t want to upset my parents. i understand their need to keep a part of my
    brother alive. nor do i want to stop having holiday parties at my home. my parents''
    home is messy, cluttered, and they have cats to which my husband is allergic.

    upsetting my already emotionally fragile parents? -- disgusted hostess'

    five years ago, prior to my grandmother''s death, she gave my brothers and me
    her summer home. when we all went to see the place, we found an overgrown lot
    with a house in complete disrepair. my brothers and their families wanted nothing
    to do with restoring it. they said they had neither the time nor the money to
    put into repairs, and "camping wasn''t their thing." we all knew the only value
    in the place was the land, so we had a real estate company give us an appraisal.
    my husband and i decided we did want to rebuild the house, so we paid my brothers
    the full value of the property. five years and thousands of dollars later, the
    house has been rebuilt from the frame up. and now, here''s the problem: my brothers
    and their wives say it is the "family" summer home and are demanding keys so they
    can come up and stay anytime. i had planned all along to hold family picnics and
    such, but not give out keys to the place. my brothers are furious with me, and
    so is my mother. they say i''m "greedy" and don''t know how to share. but abby,
    we paid them off. we did all the work, and we pay all the bills each month, not
    to mention the taxes. the house is in my name only. now i wish grandma had donated
    the land to the state park and kept us out of it. i know she wanted it to stay
    in the family, and so did i, but i don''t think my family is being fair. grandma
    was also a hard worker, and she wasn''t the type to let people walk all over her.

    brought a girlfriend to my home explaining that "megan''s" mother was on drugs
    and megan had no place to live. the mother was living between her car and an occasional
    motel room. i felt sorry for the girl and allowed her, with her mother''s permission,
    to stay with us. megan''s mother ultimately abandoned her. megan wound up in police
    custody through no action of her own. i was called to retrieve her from the police
    station. i was then asked to take the girl into my home, as there is a shortage
    of foster homes in our area and i had a foster license from years ago. megan moved
    in, and i provided her with the essentials -- some clothing, a bedspread of her
    choosing, a yearbook from school, etc. suddenly, brittany has decided that she
    "hates" megan, and she is now begging me to get her out of my home. i agreed to
    foster this girl, and there is nowhere else for her to go. brittany is now avoiding
    us. she is no longer speaking to megan and has stated that she''ll let us have
    our "new granddaughter" -- she hates her. she''s overly rude to megan at family
    functions, excludes her from regular social occasions, and barely speaks to me
    or her grandfather anymore. i''m not stupid. i know brittany is jealous, although

    rid of" megan -- and she doesn''t care where she goes. my daughter just says,
    "well, what did you expect?" and gives me no backup or support. i don''t want

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my family owns a golf course. one of the longtime members, a man i''ll call "jack,"
    died suddenly. another member took it upon himself to commission a watercolor
    of a golf scene and hang it in the pro shop in jack''s memory. the painting is
    tastefully done, matted and framed with a brass plaque stating, "in memory of
    ..." the problem is, it just appeared on the wall without getting permission.
    the deceased member''s family saw it recently and had no idea it had been done
    or who did it. apparently, the golf pro knew about it, but he left on vacation
    right after it was put up and never notified us. he quit as soon as he returned
    from vacation -- but he did identify the person who had the painting commissioned.
    the fact that someone would think it appropriate to put a memorial in another''s
    place of business strikes me as odd. we have had many members pass away, and there
    is no picture hanging in their memory. jack donated time and money to the course,
    and a bridge has been dedicated in his memory and a sign erected at the bridge.
    however, other past members have contributed as much or more than jack did, and
    there''s nothing in their honor or memory. enough is enough. i think the best
    place for the picture is with jack''s widow. i believe she would appreciate the
    fact that a club member had the painting done in her husband''s memory and would
    enjoy looking at it -- in her home. what do you think, abby? -- strikes me as

    our 23-year-old son, "jason," told me yesterday about a letter he had received
    from his grandmother. in it she complained that she''s embarrassed by his having
    fathered a child out of wedlock and said the situation is "very difficult" for
    her. she is deeply religious, but known for her affinity for gossip. our younger
    son, "connor," spent last summer in jail for stealing from us and possession of
    a controlled substance, but he did not receive a similar letter. although i would
    have preferred that jason and his girlfriend had taken more time to build their
    relationship and marry before adding a baby to the family, they are very happy
    about the impending arrival, and he has purchased a beautiful ring. i don''t think
    my mother-in-law''s attempt to shame him into marriage would make a solid foundation
    for their relationship, nor does a guilt trip make a healthy honeymoon getaway.
    my husband, in a rare flash of wisdom, suggested (but not to his mother) that
    if the situation is too "difficult" for her, perhaps she ought not talk about
    it. should i tell this woman that if she can''t be supportive, she should keep
    a respectful distance? or should i let jason and his father deal with her? i am
    too upset by her behavior in general to separate this issue from her usual judgmental,
    self-righteous and gossipy nature, and would like never to speak to her again,
    but i''m sure that''s not a constructive solution to the problem. thank you for
    your insight. -- irate in new york'

    loving, affectionate, generous and caring. so why am i complaining? because he
    is always here. he never leaves! yes, i get to work all day and he stops in only
    a few times a day, but the minute i am done, he is at my door. he usually has
    dinner with me or wants to take us out, so i have a hard time saying no. he respects

    they are asleep, so the only time i have to myself is when i''m sleeping. he spends
    every waking hour with me and comes with me wherever i go. gary jumps in and pays
    for everything before i can even pull my wallet from my purse. i feel crazy for
    complaining, but it makes me feel so indebted. i also feel stalked, controlled

    with her. now karen is upset with me! she says i am "insane" to think he would
    harm me and my family. she said if he tried to harm trish it would be at the club
    where she dances. abby, i lived through violence as a child, and i know you can

    i recently accepted the honor of raising my 10-year-old nephew, "matt." i have
    a daughter, "sierra," who is also 10. sierra''s father is being a jerk about my
    raising someone else''s child. he claims that by having matt in the house, i am
    "taking away" from our daughter. she calls him the brother she has always wanted.
    matt was in trouble in the past. he has issues because he has been passed around
    a lot. we''re dealing with it as a family. matt is getting used to the fact that
    i am not going to throw him away no matter what he does, and he''s straightening
    up. he''s a great kid. what should i do about the fact that my daughter''s dad
    won''t stop with the "he has parents, let them raise him" remarks? if i send matt
    back, i know he''ll end up in jail. he''s doing well here. i told sierra''s father
    to mind his own business and i will handle mine, but he''s being hateful about
    it toward me and our daughter. i know you''ll have something good for me, abby.

    i am being sort of sexually harassed, and i don''t know what to do. i''m 15 and

    has never tried to touch me, and i don''t think he ever would, but the comments

    is very domineering. also, joey has always had trouble making friends, and mike

    after an unhappy, sexless 12-year marriage, i divorced my husband. six months
    later i met a handsome, divorced dermatologist on the internet. we were immediately
    attracted to each other and, six weeks later, he invited me to move in with him,
    which i did. last week after i picked up our clothes at the dry cleaner and checked
    them as i loaded them into the car, i came across an expensive black lace bra,
    size 36dd. (i am a small b.) i became very upset -- i tend to be the jealous type
    -- and threw it out the sunroof of my car onto the freeway on my way home. when
    my boyfriend got home from his medical meeting that night, i confronted him. he
    told me it had to have been mistakenly added to our order, and asked me what i
    had done with it. when i said i had thrown it out, he became irate and ordered
    me to look for it. the next day, his friend (a lawyer) called me and told me the
    bra was evidence in a sexual assault case. he said it had dna on it and he needed
    it for court. he said i should go back to the freeway and look for it. i did,
    but could not locate it. i feel guilty for losing my temper and for possibly causing

    for many people, home is a place where they feel safe and secure. but what happens
    when "home" becomes a place you need to escape from because of a fire? if you
    don''t have an immediate answer to that question, you are not alone. many individuals
    do not have a plan, or practice what to do in the event of a fire. but these life-saving
    steps are critical. eight out of every 10 fire deaths in the united states occur
    in homes. each year, between 2,500 and 3,000 people are killed in home fires,
    while an estimated 12,000 to 13,000 suffer injuries. all of us must share in the
    responsibility of protecting ourselves, our homes and our communities from fire.
    ideally, this means preventing fires from happening in the first place, but it
    also means being prepared to escape should a fire occur. planning and practicing
    escape from a fire makes it more likely that people will survive one. all families
    should also make sure they have working smoke alarms. in order to successfully
    escape a fire, it is vital to be alerted to one as early as possible. smoke alarms
    should be on every level of your home, inside each sleeping room and outside each
    sleeping area. they should be tested once a month and should never be disabled
    or have their batteries removed. i hope that everyone reading this will take the

    i have read your column for years but can''t recall this topic ever being mentioned.
    i''m surprised, as it must occur frequently in today''s society. i am a 64-year-old
    male who was married to a woman i''ll call "myrtle" at age 19 in 1962. we raised
    our four children and divorced after 25 years of marriage. the divorce was brutal
    and vicious. afterward, i moved on with my life. i remarried in 1991; myrtle never
    remarried. well, myrtle died. the children invited me and my wife, "peggy," to
    the funeral. to my surprise, peggy said we should go and "be there for the kids."
    however, i told my children i would not feel comfortable being there and would
    send flowers instead. i know my children were disappointed and wanted peggy and
    me there, as they were kind of persistent. i did have second thoughts about it
    and guilt set in, but i stayed with my decision. now that it''s all over, i have
    this feeling that maybe i made a mistake and appeared to be selfish, uncaring
    or whatever. do you think i should send them a card or letter asking forgiveness,
    or just leave it alone, as apparently they have accepted it? -- second thoughts

    i have had a friend for about a year and a half i''ll call "april." within three
    months of the time april and i met, she asked to borrow money from me. i didn''t
    have it, so i got a payday loan for her. i felt i could trust her to repay me
    -- and she did. some weeks later, april was again in a desperate situation, so
    i did it again -- although i did not give her as much as she asked for. she didn''t
    appear to believe me when i said that''s all they''d give me. april is also borrowing
    money from these payday loan places. her husband doesn''t know about it or their
    financial situation. she''s behind in all their bills and is receiving disconnect
    and overdraft notices left and right. she also continues to ask me for money.
    i have bills and am behind in some of them myself. this situation is making me
    very uncomfortable. i know if i asked april for money, she would not do for me
    what i have done for her. i have tried to refuse her, but she won''t take no for
    an answer. she always has a reason why i should that trumps my excuse. i hate

    i am close friends with a couple i''ll call "angie" and "gil." i met them at the
    same time and have always been unattached while they are a married couple. this
    didn''t matter, and we hit it off right away. the problem is, when angie gets
    mad at gil for whatever reason, she wants me to be mad, too. she thinks i should
    take sides, and this makes me uncomfortable because they are both my friends.
    gil has never asked me to take sides with him. angie has gone so far as to request
    that i ignore any attempts by gil to contact me if they are fighting. (he never
    does.) i feel bad for him and like i am betraying a friend by agreeing to do as
    she asks. i don''t know how to explain to her that as they are both my friends,
    i would rather be left out of their arguments and not have to choose sides. am

    i have a problem i have never seen in your column. my jealous husband created
    a fictional online character and contacted me through a christian support e-group.
    i began corresponding with this person via e-mail. this was a character designed
    to match all my preferences. when he offered to meet in person, i refused, but
    he continued to increase the intimacy of the messages until i eventually expressed

    i find myself in a situation i am not sure how to handle. my mother has adopted
    my 10-year-old nephew. the boy has severe mental and emotional problems because
    of the home environment he was in with my sister. mom and i often talk about what
    we want to happen if something should happen to us. we know we need to get wills
    and living wills made. my problem is, if something should happen to mom and my
    stepdad, i will be the logical choice to get my nephew. i have two young children
    to consider if i take him in. the boy has already shown predatory tendencies.
    he has spent six months in a mental hospital because of his problems. i do not
    want to bring him into my home if i cannot trust him with my children. at this
    point, i don''t like leaving him alone in the house with them even if i am outside.
    abby, i don''t want my nephew to leave the family, but i cannot risk my children''s
    safety and bring him into my home. should i tell mom that i''ll take him in if
    something happens to her, or tell her i can''t risk having him in my home? --

    i am the single mother of a wonderful 13-year-old son. his father and i were divorced
    when he was 1. aside from some help and love from my parents when he was young,
    i have raised my son practically by myself. nana and dad looked after "todd" while
    i was at work, which allowed them a lot of time together when he was young. i
    have taught todd to be honest and thoughtful, to have empathy, to care about others
    and respect their feelings. i tell him to think before he speaks so he won''t
    hurt or offend other people. i ask him most of all to respect himself, to set
    goals and try his best at whatever he does. friends and neighbors say i''m raising
    a terrific young man. the problem is my dad. when my siblings and i were young,
    dad was verbally abusive. when he greets todd he says, "hey, you little jerk,"
    or, "hey, you fink!" i have asked dad several times not call todd such names,
    to the point of tears. it reminds me of being called "good-for-nothing," "worthless,"
    etc., when i was a kid. dad is 72 and not in the greatest health, and i don''t
    want to distance my son from him. the love between them is enormous. but each
    time dad calls todd one of those names, it opens the wounds of my childhood and
    reminds me of how little i thought of myself when i was his age. how can i keep
    dad from calling my son these names? -- got no respect in defiance, ohio'

    i''m an active, 31-year-old woman. i exercise regularly, play tennis and walk
    to work instead of driving. as a result, i have developed an athletic physique.
    according to my doctor, my height and weight proportions are ideal for someone
    who exercises regularly, and my muscle/fat ratio is healthy. my problem is my
    mother. she stands 5-foot-5 (the same height as me) and weighs all of 95 pounds.
    she raised me to accept myself the way i am and not to change my appearance just
    because others want me to. in spite of this, she constantly belittles me about
    my appearance with comments such as, "oh, you would look so much better if you''d
    lose 15 pounds," or, "oh, maybe you should eat a little healthier -- you''ve put
    on weight." the mass in question is muscle, not fat. i had this checked by my
    doctor, who assured me that i have a healthy build. i have tried explaining to
    my mother that my build is the result of muscle as well as genetics, but she won''t
    stop. i have tried ignoring her comments, contradicting them with medical evidence,
    even saying that her comments negate the way she raised me, but she continues

    about a year ago, my husband had lunch with an old college friend who lives in
    maryland. they have been sending e-mails back and forth ever since. she has invited
    him to stay with her when he goes east on business; she has suggested that they
    take time together to see sights in the east, etc. she has also sent him several
    gifts (gift certificates for dinner, massages, coffee beans, cards), all of which
    were either e-mailed or sent to his office. i know this because he used the gift
    certificates to take me and his two kids to dinner. he insists that there is nothing
    between him and this woman, but he will not discontinue the friendship. he says
    he should be allowed to have women friends and insists that i''m out of line by

    i was married a year ago. during our honeymoon, my husband started telling me
    i could not wear my wedding band and engagement ring together -- they were "too
    flashy," and he didn''t want people to think he had money. (my wedding band and
    engagement ring together are about 2 1/2 carats.) being a brand-new bride, and
    excited about being able to wear both my rings, i refused his request. over the
    past year he has brought it up again often, saying i should wear only my wedding
    band. i love my rings and want to wear both. he selected my engagement ring himself,
    and we picked out my wedding band together, so i don''t understand why he didn''t
    buy me a smaller engagement ring or suggest that i get a simpler wedding band.
    i wouldn''t have cared if my rings were smaller, but now that i have them, i love
    wearing them, and i don''t want to stop. i always take my rings off when i''m
    in the shower. three weeks ago, while i was taking my shower, my husband took
    my engagement ring. now he refuses to give it back to me. i have searched everywhere,
    but i have no idea where he put it. every time i look at my hand and see my lonely
    wedding band, i wish i had my engagement ring. i miss wearing it, and i''m beginning
    to resent my husband over this. please tell me, abby, am i being petty and materialistic,

    i am a single mother of three girls, ages 12, 5 and 3. yes, they all have the
    same father -- which is part of my dilemma. when my oldest daughter was 2, her
    father and i broke up and were apart for seven years. he has always been a good
    father, so we never lost contact with each other. well, a couple of years later
    he became engaged, and in 2002 he got married. the problem is i was seven months''
    pregnant with our second child when he married. two years after he was married,
    i gave birth to our third child. despite my family''s urging, i firmly believe
    that i should not be the one to tell his wife about his two "other" children.
    the girls are getting older and want to spend more time with their father -- not
    to mention that sometimes i just need a break! after five years, he still cannot
    bring himself to tell his wife. the younger two kids have never been to his house,
    and when he does come around to see them or take them somewhere, it''s only for
    a few hours at a time -- maybe a couple of days out of the month. i definitely

    doesn''t, but expects it. last year it didn''t bother me because we would go to

    offered to pay. i am unsure how to tell her she must pay or she won''t get any

    my problem is my older sister. she lives across the country from me, but feels,

    she wants any of the stuff i''m selling. i have taken good care of my records
    over the years, so i can get top dollar, then buy more items i want while culling
    the things i don''t listen to anymore. my sister acts like she should have first
    dibs and tries to guilt-trip me for not thinking of her first. what''s up? i feel

    but she tries to force me to grovel and convince her that i have done the right
    thing. i don''t make a lot of money. i couldn''t afford to buy the things i get

    after the dissolution of a 24-year marriage. i am told i''m pretty. i''m in good
    shape, exercise regularly and take care of myself. young men often hit on me.
    my dilemma is that i find men in their 30s, 40s and 50s extremely hard to figure
    out. one minute they can''t live without you, the next they want you to leave
    them alone and won''t talk to you. what''s the deal? i dated one man (age 50)
    for eight months. he wined and dined me, said he loved me, even talked about marriage.
    we were close -- i thought. our lives became very busy with work and kids, so
    we took a break for a while. when i tried to talk to him again, it was like there
    had never been any connection at all. he had lost all feeling, desire and passion.
    i still had it, but -- zip! -- his was gone. how does that happen? i dated another
    guy who couldn''t keep his hands off me. i ended it after a month because i was
    afraid he was going to try to make love to me in the middle of the restaurant.
    another man is very nice, but stiff. i can''t get close to him at all. i met a
    really interesting guy on the beach yesterday. he was around my age and took me
    out on his catamaran. i had a great time. he said afterward he''d be there the
    next day and to come to say hello. well, he was there like he said, but when i
    went to say hello, he completely ignored me and walked in the other direction.
    go figure. why can''t i find a nice older man to settle down with, enjoy life
    and companionship with, and grow old with? i don''t want to be alone, but it''s
    really hard to find a compatible mate at this stage of life. any suggestions?

    we''re having a problem with my little sister, "madison." she''s 6 -- almost 7.
    mom told me that madison talked to her dad and told him that my grandfather touched
    her. two weeks after madison told him, he finally told my mom. mom talked to madison
    about it, but she denied saying it. mom asked me if i would talk to my little
    sister and see what her response was. when i asked her if grandpa had touched
    her, she put her head down and quietly said, "no." she does that when she''s lying.
    i waited an hour or so and asked about it again. she still said no, so i asked
    if she would like me to talk to grandpa for her. she said yes. then i asked, "so
    he did touch you?" she quickly said no and changed the subject. mom and i don''t

    my boyfriend and i have a friend, "will," who is 25. we''ve known him several
    years, and he has always been a very down-to-earth, pleasant, easygoing person.
    however, it has become apparent that will is bipolar and is currently in the middle
    of an extreme manic episode that has lasted for about a month. he agreed to go
    to a doctor for evaluation, and was immediately put on lithium, which he is not
    taking regularly, if at all. he has refused further treatment. while will is not
    violent, he has had at least one car accident that probably gave him a concussion,
    and he has wandered aimlessly in the desert and city for days, barefoot in hot
    temperatures, which resulted in dehydration. now he is getting worse. he thinks
    he is superhuman, and he''s hearing voices. we feel he needs 24-hour companionship
    and support. whenever he is left alone, will runs away and disappears -- although
    he eventually calls to be picked up. he has disappeared for up to a week at a
    time and has run away three times now. he has no sense of reality at this point.
    he thinks he has transcended to a new level of understanding and doesn''t want
    to lose his new "insight." he also has personal issues with his parents, so he
    doesn''t want to stay with them. we are no longer able to take will into our home
    because the last time we did it ended badly, and it''s obvious he needs professional
    help that we are unable to provide. we''re afraid if he doesn''t get treatment,
    he will hurt himself. how can we help him? -- jenny in scottsdale, ariz.'

    i have been in a relationship with a wonderful man i''ll call "alain" for 2 1/2

    not to drink. he recently admitted to me that he is not consistent with the antabuse,

    i hired a caregiver i''ll call annie to stay with my father while i work. when
    setting up dad''s pills for the coming week, i noticed that only one pill remained

    i asked annie about it; she denied any knowledge. no one other than my husband,
    annie and annie''s adult, mentally ill daughter have access. a few days later,
    annie apologized and confessed that she had taken the pills. she once suffered

    to help. (my father needs it to stay awake during the day.) annie also has her

    at 16, i married a man i didn''t love. no excuses, but the stress of that marriage

    my second husband and i opened our home to my oldest daughter and her two children.
    (she had her third baby while living with us.) sadly, my daughter is perpetuating
    the abusive behavior she grew up with. i tried to gently bring it to her attention

    separated herself and her children from me, and through telephone conversations

    while i was growing up, my parents made fun of and belittled me. everything i
    said was either "ridiculous" or wrong in some way. i was teased at school by the
    other children, and my parents wondered aloud what i was doing wrong to cause
    them to tease me. i was told to "grow a thicker skin" or "get over it." no one
    seemed to understand how much it hurt being picked on all the time. over the years,
    i have learned to look the other way when i feel bad because i know most people
    probably don''t mean it. last week, however, i defended myself against a co-worker
    who took everything i said and turned it into a joke. we were with a group of
    people, and everything i said seemed to be simply hilarious. i was embarrassed
    and hurt because when i asked her to stop, she just laughed and said, "i can''t
    help it! you leave yourself wide open!" i became very angry and told her she should
    hang out with some of the others who like to joke that way, and that not everyone
    thinks her kind of humor is funny. i ran into her the next day, and when i greeted
    her, her response was, "frankly, after your little outburst, i have nothing to
    say to you!" she hasn''t spoken to me in a week. now i feel guilty for having
    spoken up. i plan to write her a letter of apology. i never intended to return
    the hurt she was giving me -- just to make her aware of how she made me feel.

    i am a 79-years-young woman living in my own home with my 84-year-old husband,
    "jack." jack was an avid gardener who enjoyed tending our large yard full of roses,
    fruit trees, and a variety of flowers and vegetables. during the past year, however,
    jack''s health has deteriorated and he can no longer do much around our home.
    i have tried to take over some of the gardening, but haven''t the time or energy
    to keep it up to jack''s standards. otherwise, i feel we''re doing well. i still
    drive and keep house and enjoy our great-grandchildren. i used to keep my home
    to very strict standards, but in recent years have realized that a few dust bunnies
    are not a crime. lately, my daughter, granddaughter and even our oldest great-granddaughter
    have been trying to push us into living closer to them, into a smaller home with
    less yard and what they believe would be less work for me. unfortunately, this
    has led to harsh words exchanged between my daughter and me. when my granddaughter
    agreed with my daughter, i told them to stay out of our business and let us run
    our own lives. when my granddaughter said the family was only trying to plan ahead
    and prepare me for when i would be alone, i yelled at her and told her they didn''t
    have the right to force their opinions on me. recently my husband''s doctor told
    him he can no longer drive and he was given a walker. we have not told our children
    because we dread that they''ll force us to move, or worse, force me to put jack
    in a home. i do not believe this would be the best choice at this time. we do
    not want to be a burden on our children. i believe i am able to take care of my
    husband, my home and my life without our children and grandchildren interfering.
    how can i get them to understand this without creating more bad feelings? i know
    they read your column. can you help them understand that i have the right to continue
    to live in my home as long as i wish, and the choice to move should be mine --

    my husband and i were recently asked to join another couple, "johnny" and "brooke,"
    at an upscale restaurant that we would not ordinarily frequent. we decided to
    join them and had a lovely, if extremely expensive, dinner. when the check came,
    johnny took several gift cards out of his pocket and applied them to their half
    of the bill. (they covered the majority of it.) we had no idea that this was the
    reason johnny and brooke wanted to eat there and were shocked that they had not
    said something earlier. we might have declined. of course, we paid our portion
    of the bill, but when we discussed it later, we both felt that we had been duped.
    had the tables been turned, we would have applied the gift cards to the entire
    bill. were we duped, and were they cheap? -- am i stupid in pomona, n.y.?'

    my 43-year-old daughter, "wendy," three granddaughters (7, 8 and 11) and son-in-law,
    "todd," have been guests in my house for six months. last february, wendy called
    to say they were being evicted for nonpayment of rent. she said they would be
    homeless if i didn''t let them come to my home for a while. i agreed to let them
    be guests in my home for three months, provided she and todd both got jobs and
    saved for a rental during that time. after three months, i reminded them they
    needed to move into a place of their own. todd has produced a short film for which
    he was paid, and wendy is working in a retail store. at that point i was very
    tired. i had virtually become a maid in my own home, baby-sitting for them because
    todd works out of the area much of the time and wendy works evenings and weekends.
    i also do most of the housecleaning and provide transportation for my granddaughters
    after school. my daughter told me they had saved no money and couldn''t move.
    i find it strange, since i haven''t asked for any rent while they have been with
    me. i agreed they could stay two more months if they would actually save the money
    they were earning. i also suggested they sell one of their expensive cars, and
    either manage with one or buy an old one with the cash from the sale, so they
    wouldn''t have such large payments and insurance. at the end of that time, they
    still had done none of the above. it has now been six months since they moved
    in. i am not prepared to allow them any more time in my home. wendy has become
    verbally abusive, and i have become extremely nervous. at times i fear for my
    safety. am i being unreasonable in demanding they leave? -- fed-up grandmother'

    several years ago, when i was a divorced single father raising two adolescent
    children, we received an invitation to attend a wedding in chicago. the bride''s
    parents were cousins i hadn''t seen or heard from in more than 20 years. the wedding
    coincided with the school break. i had accumulated vacation time at work and enough
    room on my charge cards to cover the cost of the expensive trip, so i replied
    that we would be glad to attend. i was excited to reconnect with the family and
    that my children would meet many of their relatives for the first time. boy, was
    i wrong! the reception was held in the ballroom of an expensive hotel. instead
    of being seated with my family, i was placed at a table on the opposite side of
    the huge ballroom. at the table were several couples and a few single women, all
    of whom seemed to know each other well. i felt somewhat out of place, but made
    light conversation, danced a few dances and tried to have a good time. an aunt
    approached, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me to join the family in a side
    room. when i entered, the men patted me on the shoulders and the women proceeded
    to tell me that the lady i had been seated next to had decided that i would be
    an acceptable husband for her! i was then told they would make all the wedding
    arrangements as quickly as possible. at first i thought they were joking or that
    they had tasted too much of the bubbly. then, in shock, i realized they were serious.
    i asked why they didn''t consult me first. i made it plain i wasn''t going to
    pull my kids out of school, away from their friends, sell my house, quit my job
    and throw away all our community relationships to move to a city halfway across
    the country, into an environment that was foreign to us, and marry a woman i had
    never met before. i told them the idea was insane and insulting. they looked at
    me as if i were speaking a foreign language. i was told that because they had
    gone out of their way to arrange this match for me, my refusal was the height
    of selfishness and i was an ingrate. angry, i took my children and left. my children
    are now on their own, and i''m involved with a wonderful lady. we have been invited
    to a family gathering in los angeles, which will be attended by the group from
    chicago. my lady friend has been pressing me to meet more of my family. i''m afraid
    to introduce her because i''m afraid she''ll see how crazy my relatives are and

    i have read your column for the better part of 20 years and always enjoyed it,
    even if i didn''t always agree with your advice. the fact that it makes us think
    is what makes it so enjoyable. now i find myself writing to get an opinion on
    a matter that has been very hard for me. i have been married for the last 20 years
    to a woman who has been hard to get along with, at best. we were married because
    she became pregnant. i thought i was doing the right thing. later, i found out
    she had stopped taking birth control pills so she could get me to marry her. looking
    back, it was not the right thing to do. i have stayed married and we have had
    a second child. again, she was on the pill, and again i thought i was doing the
    right thing by staying around to be the father. i removed my wedding ring 10 years
    ago and have been barely getting along with her while i work a lot of jobs away
    from the house to avoid the never-ending arguments. i don''t hate her or wish
    anything bad for her, but i have reached the point where i can no longer stand
    to be around her. i have concluded that staying married for the sake of the kids
    and trying to be a two-parent family was the wrong thing to do. i know the ensuing
    divorce will be ugly, with her constantly harassing me, but how can i help her
    to see that our marriage has been a train wreck in slow motion for 20 years? --

    i carpool my daughter, "leslye," to school with one other student. it has been
    helpful because leslye needs to be taken to and from school five days a week.
    the problem is, leslye does not like riding in the other mother''s car because
    it is filthy. leslye has come home with stains on her pants from sitting on melted
    crayons, old food, etc. she tells me that it''s ok for all trash to be thrown

    if "looking" wanted a college-educated woman, then why did he date and start living

    be questioning their relationship and having major concerns about his ability

    here''s one for the books on parental stupidity. when my daughter, "marissa,"
    began to reach her teen years, her father -- in an attempt to be funny -- advised
    her that she could keep from becoming pregnant by putting an aspirin between her
    knees and keeping it there. my stupidity was assuming that sex education and pregnancy
    prevention were taught in her school. i never broached the subject with her. marissa
    became pregnant at 15. the young man she was seeing told her she couldn''t get
    pregnant in a swimming pool because the chlorine would kill the sperm. have you
    heard that before? needless to say, the inevitable result was a baby. i love my
    grandson dearly. god did not make a mistake even though we adults were all dummies
    in the advice department. please tell parents, children and adults to educate
    themselves and learn all the facts and fictions about teen pregnancy and prevention.

    my friend "nora" was very shaken by something that happened to her recently. while
    her six grandchildren were visiting, the oldest boy (age 13) shouted, "let''s
    take her down!" and all six of the children attacked her, knocking her to the
    ground, then groping and hitting her. nora is 73 and only 5 foot 2. her oldest
    grandchild is 5 foot 7 and weighs 140 pounds. all of the grandchildren are large
    for their ages. the youngest, who is 7, weighs well over 70 pounds. my question
    is, what can elderly people do to protect themselves? nora felt helpless. she
    took the beating because she was afraid if she fought back, she''d be turned in
    for child abuse. i told her i''d have whacked that 13-year-old monster so hard
    he''d think twice about ever pulling a stunt like that again. now she''s afraid
    of her grandkids because, even though their parents eventually pulled them off
    her, they did nothing to punish the children for their aggressive behavior. is
    there anything older people can do to defend themselves against delinquents? --

    i have started seeing a guy i love very much. i''ll call him "mitch." we spend
    a lot of time together. i have stayed with him while my 2-year-old son, "caleb,"
    visits his daddy. i recently introduced caleb to mitch, and last weekend we both
    stayed at mitch''s place. the problem is, mitch has a large dog that is very territorial
    and protective and isn''t used to company. the dog, "crusher," has shown aggression
    toward me, but it was nothing we couldn''t handle. however, the dog is now being
    aggressive toward caleb. on a couple of occasions, crusher charged my son and
    left scratches. mitch and i have resorted to separating the two when caleb is
    over. by "separating," i mean we have brought a few of caleb''s toys and his tv
    to set up in a room just for him. the problem is, caleb is in the room with the
    door closed most of the time, while crusher runs free in the house. abby, my son''s
    life was turned upside down when my husband and i divorced. now he has had to
    adjust to the fact that when he''s with mitch and me, he must be carried around
    for fear of the dog. i haven''t come out and asked mitch to get rid of crusher,
    or even to limit him when we are in the house. is this something i have a right
    to ask? mitch has been a bachelor all his life, and i''m afraid if i confront

    my husband, "gregg," and i have been married seven years. we have two children.
    gregg was recently laid off, and after doing some research, we decided we''d like
    to move to texas where my brother-in-law and his family live. there is more career
    opportunity for us there, and we have been actively researching careers and housing.
    the problem is my father and stepmother are against us moving even two hours away,
    let alone halfway across the country. we have not told them of our plans yet,
    but even a casual mention of a long-distance move brought my father to anger and
    tears for fear that he won''t see his only grandchildren and me. his wife made
    it worse, claiming i was "selfish" for wanting to move away. abby, my parents
    have made their life choices. they have settled down and are happy with their

    do without them making us feel guilty? -- conflicted in south dakota'

    i am being married this summer. it will be a fairly large wedding with 185 guests.
    my fiance''s parents and grandparents are very supportive. the problem is my mother.
    she''s an alcoholic. when she drinks she can''t stop, and usually becomes angry
    and belligerent. she will cause a scene and beg people for money. if she doesn''t
    get exactly what she wants when she wants, she throws temper tantrums and has
    been known to become violent. mom has promised me she''ll refrain from drinking
    at my reception, but neither my fiance nor i believe her. what are my options
    at this point? should i allow her to come, with the risk that she''ll ruin our
    big day? or should i bar her from the reception? keep in mind that mother was
    drunk during my entire high school graduation party. my friends and teachers who
    were there could see her bloodshot eyes and smell the alcohol on her breath. she
    was rude to everyone. i had a collage of their pictures on display, and she spent
    most of her time at the party coloring over their faces. it was the most embarrassing

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i met my best friend, "chanelle," a hairstylist, 20 years ago when she worked
    in a beauty salon and i was a walk-in client. we hit it off immediately. she has
    been doing my hair ever since, and i have referred clients to her over the years.
    about 10 years ago, chanelle began working full-time in her family''s business,
    but continued hairstyling on the side -- first in a salon, now from her home.
    over the past three years, i have become increasingly unhappy with her haircuts
    and color. i expressed it to chanelle, but she didn''t really respond. (example:
    i want red hair, but when i asked for more red, she made it darker and darker.
    now it looks auburn in daylight.) i was recently out of town and took the opportunity
    to make an appointment at a well-known salon. the stylist there informed me that
    no one has had a hairstyle like mine in 10 years. she also gave me the color i
    had been trying to get from chanelle for the last three years. i had her write
    down the formula and gave it to chanelle when i got home. i recently went for
    a cut and color, expecting that chanelle would use the formula i had given her.
    instead, she informed me that she had thrown it away because she is a "colorist"
    and can match colors on sight. needless to say, the color is not what i wanted.
    when i told her that, she told me the lighting in her home is different and that
    it would look right outside. i called her again from home to say it didn''t. all
    she said was it would fade over time. i made an appointment at a salon today to
    get the color i want. obviously, i don''t want to go back to chanelle. she hasn''t
    taken a class in 10 years, and she has been shining me on. how do i tell her without
    ruining our friendship? i should add that she was hypercritical of the cut i got
    on my trip, which is actually the best haircut i''ve had in three years. -- bad

    i am an 11-year-old girl in sixth grade. my problem is there''s this girl, "stacey,"
    who is in special ed who gets picked on every day. my friends pick on her a lot,
    and it makes me disgusted because stacey doesn''t have any control over how she
    was born. today, my friends and i were playing a game to see who could get the
    most hugs, and i went up to stacey who was sitting outside alone like always and
    gave her a hug. then my friends started giving her hugs, and it made me so happy
    to see the look on her face! she was smiling with pure joy. abby, if you put this
    in your column, could you tell people that just giving a hug to someone who doesn''t
    normally get one might make their day? also, can you tell me how to get my friends

    you know what? i think "too tired" needs to suck it up and do the job assigned

    and get home for dinner. in college you can schedule classes to start at 3 in
    the afternoon if you want, sleep in and enjoy your mornings. it''s time for "too

    i was married to my childhood sweetheart, "dexter," for 13 years. only the first
    five were happy. the rest were spent trying to adjust to his alcoholism and make
    excuses for why he drinks. we have two children, 12 and 10, whom i love dearly.
    i finally made the decision to leave when i realized what a poor example dexter
    was setting for them. the problem is, he continually harasses me. he calls constantly
    and drops over to my apartment without calling. when the kids see their father,
    they just let him in. if i''m not home, dexter questions them about who they have
    seen me with and whatever other information he can pry out of them. my son asks
    me if it''s ok, or what he should say. i have nothing to hide and am not seeing
    anyone. i told him it''s wrong of his father to ask, but if he does then to be
    honest. i love dexter, but i''m so tired and emotionally drained i don''t know
    what to do. i feel this tremendous responsibility for him, and i don''t know where
    it comes from. he was always the dominant one in our relationship. i never even
    decorated our home because he picked everything out on the pretense of "surprising"
    me. i give dexter money when he asks for it, even though i have the children and
    he isn''t supporting us. i''m in the process of filing for child support, but
    feel guilty doing it -- like he is going to suffer because i''ll be taking money

    my husband, rex, and i have been married 12 years and have two children, ages
    11 and 7. rex was married once before, while in his 20s, for a very short time.
    his first wife left him for someone else. (thankfully, there were no children
    involved.) rex does not want our children to learn about his first marriage. he
    feels it represents a failure on his part, and he sees no reason why the children
    should be told. however, his ex-wife still lives here in town, and on a couple
    of occasions we have bumped into her at local restaurants. rex was very uncomfortable
    during these encounters, and the children did not understand why. my thought is

    i was floored. so was my husband, though neither of us said a word until we were
    well on our way home and away from the "happy couple." if that wasn''t enough,
    they were complaining about some blue towels they had received that they had not

    my fiancee and i are being married in september. last december i asked a longtime
    friend, "mitch," to be a groomsman. we have been close ever since we met in middle
    school 20 years ago. mitch and i were still close until about three years ago,
    when he married and moved out of state. (i was in his wedding party and attended
    his rehearsal dinner.) last week, mitch informed me that he won''t be attending
    our rehearsal dinner because he will be attending another event that same evening.
    he will be coming in from out of state and plans to go to his nephew''s football
    game instead. he said he doesn''t feel it''s necessary to be at the rehearsal
    since he has "done it before and knows what to do." i do not feel that mitch has
    taken into account the fact that it is not just the formality of rehearsing, but
    that his presence means as much to me as his being at the wedding. he said he
    will be glad to step aside if this is not acceptable, but this creates problems,
    as i do not have anyone else to ask, other than someone i have no history with.

    approached, and they visited awhile. the difference this time was one of the men
    in the group noticed me standing there and interrupted the conversation to introduce
    himself, as did everyone else then. my so-called boyfriend never said a word.

    of sean''s family knows about serena, although most of his friends do. i am unsure

    the memory of my husband and his other self without hurting his family or our

    every faucet in our house has a slow drip -- the kitchen sink, the bathtub, the
    upstairs bathroom. my husband "earl''s" response to the kitchen drip is that he
    wants to replace the entire sink and countertop, so "we''ll do it all then." for
    the one in our bathtub, he says, "we''re going to tear all that out anyway and
    put in a new tub." earl avidly watches home improvement shows and drags me to
    home improvement stores to look at the replacements, but never buys anything or
    follows through with any projects. i am willing to approve anything that gets
    the drips stopped, whether it''s a faucet replacement or a whole new kitchen.
    earl is fully capable of doing the job himself and has all the new tools. i might
    add that he takes the same approach to the old truck he''s going to fix up, the
    painting that needs to be done, the porch to be replaced and other projects. he
    is full of talk, but to myself i refer to him as "the big drip." how do i get
    him to fix the problem? -- drippy''s wife'

    in light of the recent headlines about sub-prime lending, may i offer some advice
    to the tens of thousands of seniors who fall victim to predatory lending every
    year? bet tzedek -- the house of justice, the organization i lead in los angeles,
    offers free legal services to help people who have lost their homes to fraud and
    predatory lending. seniors can do several things to avoid being taken advantage
    of. first: any senior facing financial problems should confide in family and friends.
    each year, homeowners consult us because they''re in imminent danger of losing
    their homes and they were too ashamed to ask family members or friends for help
    or advice until it was too late. shame too often drives seniors to strangers who
    promise quick fixes. second: seniors who are behind on their mortgage should contact
    their lender. if possible, the lender will try to work something out with the
    borrower to avoid foreclosure. for help working with the lender, the senior should
    call a hud-certified counseling agency, which can give the senior advice on all
    available financial options. third: stay away from people who come to the door
    offering to "rescue" the house from foreclosure! and finally, people thinking
    about obtaining a home loan should be sure they understand the language in their
    loan documents before signing them and should be particularly careful before agreeing
    to an adjustable-rate loan. i hope that seniors everywhere will take these simple,
    proactive steps to protect their financial well-being. -- mitchell a. kamin, ceo,

    in light of the events at virginia tech, i need some advice on a situation i encountered
    at work. i travel to many retail locations each week, and sometimes i am "stationed"
    at one of them for several weeks, or even months. two months ago, i was chatting
    with a young man i''ll call "ryan," and during the conversation he told me that
    when he was in high school, he had drawn up plans for a columbine-type assault.
    the comment came out of the blue, and he laughed it off, saying it would make
    a good movie script. ryan is now at a local community college, and i would not
    want to be a student at his school. he makes me very uneasy, and i don''t like
    having to interact with him. after the virginia tech tragedy, i asked him his
    thoughts. his reply was, "i wouldn''t have killed myself." the implication was
    that the murder of 30-plus people was fine with him, but suicide would send him
    to hell. this kid really scares me, and my gut instinct is to tell the store management
    about his comments. if he gets angry someday and snaps, i will feel terrible that

    my thanks to "lauren in cave creek, ariz." (march 19) for raising the subject
    of concert etiquette. it''s one of those awkward subjects because everyone knows
    there is a proper way to do it, but no one knows what the proper way is. when
    attending a concert, look carefully at your program. often it will indicate where
    to clap. if not, determine how the musical pieces are arranged. are they in sets
    of two or three pieces? if so, clap after the set is completed, not after each
    individual piece. the pieces in a set were arranged to flow one into the other.
    clapping breaks the flow and mood the composer was trying to convey. and while
    we''re on the subject of concert manners: as a musician and music teacher, i attend
    many concerts every year, and i''m appalled at the number of people who talk in
    the middle of a musical number. whispering to your neighbor between pieces is
    fine, but talking during a musical number at a concert or dance recital (or during
    an act of a play or musical) is a big no-no! please get the word out, abby. this
    is something everyone should know. -- ms. "d" in garland, texas'

    like "fine, thank you in gastonia, n.c." (march 23), i, too, was annoyed when
    people greeted me with the mindless, "how are you?" "how ya doin''?" etc., which
    required me to respond to someone who clearly had no interest in a real response.
    (i understand their feigned interest is more automatic than rude.) so, i make
    a game of it. unlike the greeter who blurts out the salutation without thinking,
    i listen and am prepared with several responses. for "how ya doin''?" i answer,
    "not so good. my wife and oldest son and i just got out of three months in rehab
    for peanut butter addiction. i was a two-jar-a-day man myself. my boy had it even
    worse -- three jars of the hard stuff, crunchy!" when asked, "what''s up?" i''m
    inclined to respond, "my blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index!" --

    on march 4, you printed a letter about "logan," a 5-year-old boy who said he tortured
    animals because he enjoyed it. his counselor said he was "fine," and the child''s
    behavior was the result of his being "neglected." may i point out that the writer
    of that letter has only the boy''s father''s word that that was the counselor''s
    "diagnosis"? i''m no expert, but logan''s behavior seems like the result of much
    more than lack of attention. in fact, it seems like that of a textbook psychopath.
    your advice that the child needs serious psychiatric intervention was spot-on.

    right after a meal is appropriate. i brought this up with him, but he keeps saying
    that it''s the only time he can practice. my argument is: not being able to do

    ten years ago when i was in college, i worked briefly as a topless dancer to pay
    my rent. i am not proud of it, and frankly, i try to forget it ever happened.
    i am now married and have young children. my husband knows about my past and doesn''t
    judge me. we have an agreement -- we just pretend it never happened. of course,
    nothing has been said to our children or other family members, and we do not plan
    to say anything. i have a friend from college, "nancy," with whom i get together
    once or twice a year. we recently had her over. out of the blue, nancy looked
    at my 2-year-old daughter and said, "did you know your mommy used to be a stripper?"
    then she laughed. i was stunned. i let out a nervous laugh and stammered, "uhh
    ... i try to forget i ever did that." she laughed and repeated her comment to
    my child! nancy is the last person i would have expected to say something like
    that. it wasn''t meant maliciously, but i don''t know why she said it. maybe it
    was just a joke that turned out incredibly not funny. she has no children, so
    maybe she doesn''t realize how impressionable a 2-year-old is. my husband wasn''t
    in the room when it happened. when i told him about it a few days later, he was
    very upset. he said i need to address this with her before we get together again.
    he says if i don''t, he will. i feel that we don''t see nancy often enough for
    this to be an issue. i couldn''t believe she said it in the first place, but i
    can''t believe she''ll do it again. of course, i''d be horrified if she did. what

    on mother''s day, our church has a tradition of asking all the mothers in the
    congregation to stand for a blessing and recognition of their importance to our
    community and the job they are doing. my wife refuses to stand and be recognized
    by our community as a mother. she says she won''t do it because there are some
    women in our church who are not standing, and some of them might not be able to
    be mothers and may be hurt at the recognition the others are receiving. i realize
    that infertility may be a great loss to them, but these women live with it every
    day. i doubt that our church''s annual recognition of mothers will add more pain
    than those women already endure. don''t you agree? -- proud husband and father

    i am a senior in high school and bummed out about the upcoming prom. i''m dreading

    i have been in a horrible marriage for eight years. my husband, "greg," has a

    boy. he seems to be in denial, and claims it didn''t happen. in any case, i have
    had a feeling lately that greg is attracted to men and may be having some kind
    of a fling with a guy. this guy is supposed to be a business associate, but he
    calls my husband constantly and has shown up at our house at 12:30 at night. greg
    refused to answer the door, but texted him and lied to me about it. i feel like

    came up, and chris told me that he was a virgin and that it was very important
    for him to find a girl who had "never been with anyone" either. well, abby, that
    bridge was burned when i was a teenager. i was honest with chris about it, which
    was not easy because i now regret some of the poor choices i made at that time
    of my life. i am a completely different person now due to a religious conversion
    and am waiting until i am married to have sex again. i told chris this, and asked
    if he wanted to continue the relationship. his answer was he''d "have to think
    about it." we are still friends. he says he likes me and still wants us to date.
    however, although i care deeply for him, i now feel devalued. i''m afraid this
    issue is going to cause problems in the future. i believe that purity is an issue
    more of the heart than the body. if i had known that virginity was so important

    i just read the letter from "dirty family laundry" (feb. 24), who asked you how
    to stop her mother-in-law from doing her laundry. would you please ask her to
    send her mother-in-law to my house? she''d be greatly appreciated. i used to be
    picky about how laundry got done and where the dishes were put away. but now that
    i live 1,000 miles from all family, and have a baby and a 3-year-old to take care
    of and unending chores to do, i would love the help. -- tired in illinois'

    my mother-in-law used to come to our house for weekend visits. my husband and
    i would work and come home to a "clean" kitchen. the only problem was she couldn''t
    see very well, and all of the dishes were still dirty and put in the wrong cupboards.
    the stove and countertops were also covered with an inch of soap film. everything
    had to be washed all over again. after about six of her visits, and grumbling
    under our breath after she left, my husband and i decided that this would become
    the ritual and turned it into a treasure hunt to recapture our kitchen. my mother-in-law

    i have lived with the same problem for 16 years. my suggestion? stop regarding

    when i heard that my 83-year-old mother was on life support, i caught the first
    plane to california to be with her. i am listed as the executor of her estate,
    and last year she had told me where i would find all the necessary papers i would
    need when the "time comes." upon my arrival at the hospital, the doctor told my
    sister and me that mama had a very slim chance of survival. when i left the hospital
    to spend the night at mama''s house, i located the papers, figuring i''d need
    them after her impending death. i opened the box and found a handwritten letter
    on top of the stack of papers. it had been written by mama exactly two months
    before. it was her last wishes for her funeral. unknown to anyone, she had changed
    her mind and decided she wanted no memorial at a church, only a graveside service.
    shocked to read her last wishes, i felt it would be better to inform the family
    before she died rather than wait until we''d be even more distraught. well, the
    doctor was wrong. mama survived a heart valve replacement and is doing well. my

    the trailer and freed it with one mighty push. we were relieved, but there was
    still a problem. my father had been looking forward to a maine lobster dinner
    for weeks. now he feared that by the time we unhooked our truck and drove into
    town, all the seafood restaurants would be closed. one of our heroes heard dad
    and handed him a set of keys. "take my car," he said, and then he gave us directions
    to the best lobster place in town. we had a fabulous feast that night. but what
    really impressed us was the spontaneous kindness of the folks at that trailer
    park in ogunquit, maine. ever since, we have marveled at how quickly and generously
    they came to our rescue. it was the most memorable part of a great trip. --still

    my mother-in-law is coming soon for her annual two-week visit, and my nightmares
    about it have already begun. she is 78 years young, sweet and nonjudgmental. the
    problem is, she talks nonstop about people we have never met. when we introduce
    her to friends, she continues story after story about people who are of interest
    only to her. she knows what she''s doing because she''ll say, "poor thing -- i''ve
    gabbed your ear off," but she keeps talking. my mother-in-law lives alone. so
    do a lot of people, including my own mother, but no one talks as incessantly as
    she does. she''s monopolized conversations for years, so it can''t be her age.
    my husband says i should just walk away, but his mother is easily offended, and
    i don''t want to be rude. when i go to the market or wherever, she wants to accompany
    me, so there is never any respite! i tell myself it''s only two weeks a year,
    but a day with her feels like an eternity. why does she do this, and what can
    i do? help! -- talked to death in eugene, ore.'

    my mother passed away a little over a year ago, after being married to my father
    for 30 years. recently, dad has found a girlfriend -- or rather, she found him.
    i''ll call this woman alexis. alexis has taken it upon herself to come into his
    home, take down the wallpaper, paint the walls a different color, and throw away
    a lot of his "junk" -- which is what she called most of my mother''s things! she
    has also reorganized the kitchen and rearranged the furniture, books -- everything.
    one room in dad''s house was set up just for my children. alexis removed all their
    toys, put them in an upstairs closet, and replaced them with a display case filled
    with fragile china figurines. she has also instructed her granddaughter to call
    my father "grandpa." alexis prepared a holiday dinner at dad''s house and sat
    her own family at the main table. i was relegated to a card table in the other
    room. she also invited her daughter, parents and sisters to my father''s house
    for a birthday party that dad didn''t even want -- and made him foot the bill!
    she never offers to pay for anything. i think alexis thinks she''s found herself
    a "meal ticket." how do i let her know that what she''s doing is extremely rude
    without being rude myself? -- displaced daughter'

    the wedding season is approaching, and on behalf of all professional photographers,
    i''m writing about the rudeness of wedding guests who bring their own cameras
    to the wedding ceremony. they behave as if they''re at a tourist attraction. professional
    photographers honor church rules, and often the wishes of the wedding party, by
    not "blinding" the bride, the groom or the clergy by taking flash photos during
    the ceremony. after the ceremony, when we''re trying to set up formal group pictures,
    these same guests jump in front of us like paparazzi! i''ve even seen mothers
    of the bride whip out a camera. why do people hire a professional photographer
    and then allow this to happen? abby, please inform these people how rude they
    are. the bride and groom have hired us to capture their wedding on film. if the
    wedding guests want pictures, they can order them through the bride. guests do
    not bring extra flowers or an extra cake to supplement the efforts of the florist
    and caterer, so why do they do this to the photographer? our job must be done
    in a timely manner, and the kind of interference i have described prevents us
    from doing our best work in the least amount of time. -- miffed pro in south carolina'

    "proud mama of two different boys" (feb. 23) should know she is not alone. your
    response was right on, too. people will argue what they want, and sometimes it''s
    easier to nod, "agree" and walk away. when my twins were newborn, i would have
    them in their double stroller to run errands. people would stop me, look at them
    and then say, "oh, twins -- how cute! they''re identical, right? they just look
    identical!" i would look them straight in the eye, smile and say, "oh no, not
    identical. he is a boy, and she is a girl." now, abby, if the pink/blue clothing
    did not tip anyone off about their different genders, then paying attention might
    have. my son had black hair, dark brown eyes and creamy olive skin. my daughter

    my husband, "garth," and i have been happily married for more than three years
    and have an infant son. five years before i began dating garth, i became friends
    with a man i''ll call herb. after a few years, we grew very close. herb and i
    acted more like a couple than mere friends, escorting each other to parties, carrying
    on hour-long late-night phone chats before saying goodnight, finding excuses to
    be close and to touch, and a mutual jealousy of any potential suitors for either
    of us. eventually, i realized i had fallen in love with him, but i didn''t tell
    him for fear of ruining my relationship with my best friend. while i was never
    certain, i suspected that herb felt the same way about me. except for a few occasional
    kisses and tender moments, however, our relationship remained strictly platonic.
    as the years went on, i grew restless. it became apparent that even if herb did
    have feelings for me, he would never act on them. it was at this point that garth
    entered my life. he was wonderful to me, and i knew it would be unfair to both
    of us to continue the friendship with herb, so i consciously let our friendship
    slip away while i fell in love with garth. today, my life with garth is happy
    and fulfilling, and i know that he is the love of my life. despite this, i still
    miss the close relationship i had with herb. while i would never attempt to contact
    herb, i feel as if i am emotionally cheating on garth because herb crosses my
    mind several times a day, and i feel the absence of what was my best friend. these
    constant memories make me feel guilty. how can i find emotional closure from my
    past relationship? -- needs closure in the midwest'
