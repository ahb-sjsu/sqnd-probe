    i''m 45, employed and earning plenty of money. i''m in a great relationship, my
    kids and grandkids are healthy and happy, and my parents are alive and well. i

    i''m not really sure what my purpose is in life or if the way my life is, is normal.
    i feel content -- even happy at times -- but i''m troubled because it seems a
    lot of people do the exact opposite of what i am doing and they all have a purpose.
    some of them are going to school, raising kids, having relationship problems,
    money issues, etc. they seem to be doing so much, and i feel like i''m doing so

    may i comment on your response to "got here first in pennsylvania" (jan. 7), who
    asked whether someone sitting at the end of a church pew should move if someone
    comes and says it''s his or her "favorite seat"? there are many reasons why people
    remain sitting at the end of a pew: an allergy to perfumes can be overwhelming
    if you''re sitting in the middle of a row; claustrophobia; weak bladder; physical
    limitations; the need for more leg room; and the need to use the armrest to stand
    up and sit down. the early bird does get the worm and shouldn''t be expected to
    give it to latecomers. likewise, possession is nine-tenths of the law. if people
    have a favorite seat, they should arrive early to ensure they''ll get it. that''s
    what we do. and when someone wants to sit in the same pew, we smile, step aside
    and let the person in while retaining our end seats. -- overland park, kan., attendee'

    my daughter just got engaged and is beginning to plan her wedding. her fiance
    has been married before, but she hasn''t. she wants a band at the reception and
    he wants a d.j. (which he had at his first wedding). my husband is paying for
    the entire affair, and he and i support our daughter in this. i know this seems
    like a small thing, but her fiance is really digging in his heels. would it be
    wrong for her to pull the "this is my one and only wedding" card? this fight seems
    ridiculous to us. what do you think? -- parents of the bride'

    my cousin "opal" and i grew up together. we were always close. she has gone through

    not helpful. i recently completed my education and am looking for work, so money
    is tight. opal doesn''t feed her kids before bringing them over or provide diapers

    connie is a genuinely nice person and makes friends easily, which i admire. however,

    my wife has stage 4 breast cancer. she is only 51, and our most optimistic prognosis
    is three to four more years. our children, 15 and 16, understand her disease,
    but don''t really have a sense of how much longer we all have together. recently
    we went out to dinner, and the kids started talking about my retirement plans
    and their college plans. later that night, my wife told me how sad it was hearing
    the kids talk about things she knows she will never see. i have been debating
    whether i should have a talk with the kids and perhaps suggest they avoid subjects
    that make their mother sad. what do you think? -- not talking about the future'

    as a gift, my boyfriend, "seth," gave me a chihuahua puppy. i like dogs, but have
    never expressed a desire to have one. in fact, i have repeatedly mentioned my
    dislike for small dogs and that i wouldn''t have a dog due to my travel schedule
    for work. i''d have to pay for food, veterinary care, toys, boarding, etc., and
    the dog would be alone in my apartment all day while i''m at the office. seth
    still chose to give me one. when i refused his gift, he yelled and left. my friends
    think i was rude, and that seth was sweet for buying me a puppy. i tried explaining
    to them, but they were sarcastic and mean about my decision not to accept the
    dog. this isn''t the first time something like this has happened with seth. for
    my birthday he bought me a smartphone, signed me up for a two-year contract and

    my family is big on sports and discusses them at every gathering, big or small.
    i played sports growing up, but i don''t care to follow them in my adult life

    of my lack of knowledge on the current stats, etc. i have always refrained from

    my husband and i were close friends with another couple, seeing them once or twice
    a week. then we had to move away from our hometown because of a job opportunity.
    we tried to stay in touch, but predictably were not as close as when we were neighbors.
    a few months ago, we were able to move back home, and we have been trying to revive
    the friendship. we have invited them to dinner three times only to be told: "we
    have commitments this week, and next week is crazy at work. let''s try to get
    together next month when things calm down." but there was no follow-up. they do
    travel a lot, have small children and demanding jobs, so it''s hard to know if
    the delays are real or if they aren''t interested in being friends any longer.
    how much do we try before feeling we''re annoying them and giving up? -- back

    we get together she brags about how important it is to buy a house and not "waste
    money" by renting an apartment. my husband and i are happy renting because it
    allows us the money to travel and experience life together. the thought of being
    tied down to a mortgage at 23 years old for the next 30 years doesn''t sit well
    with me. i am new in my career and have no idea where it may take me. i understand
    that buying a house is a good investment. i often feel as if we are the "minority,"
    as it seems everyone is rushing to settle down, have children, buy a house, etc.
    is it wrong that we would rather wait, enjoy ourselves traveling and doing what

    my younger brother is 25. three or four months ago he got out of a six-year relationship.
    he is now dating his former boss, a woman who is at least 15 years older than
    he is. as far as i know, i''m the only one he''s told. i recently asked him how
    the romance was going and he told me things are great. he also said he''s worried
    about how to let the rest of our family know about this new relationship. do you
    have any advice i could give him about revealing something that''s sure to shock
    some members of our family? -- worried older brother in kansas city, mo.'

    my husband and i completed construction on our retirement home five years ago.
    even though we''re not retired, we were able to move in. we are now 3 1/2 hours

    at holiday or vacation time. some of them have taken us up on the invitation at
    least once. however, one of my brothers has never been here. we have a lovely
    log cabin on a lake, and it can accommodate all family members for a gathering.

    i''m a 42-year-old divorced woman with no children. my ex-husband has a son whose

    "yes, i have a stepson." why do people think it''s ok to say things like, "that''s

    i''ve been dating my 42-year-old boyfriend, "mike," for a year. i love him, but
    he''s a heavy drinker. he has a glass or two of whiskey on a daily basis and goes
    through a huge bottle of whiskey every weekend. (he also drinks beer like water.)
    when i asked him to cut back, he refused because he "loves" whiskey. i have never
    seen him drunk or act intoxicated, so he obviously has a high tolerance. it bothers
    me that mike drinks so much and that he won''t cut back. i told him i wouldn''t
    marry him unless he does. my problem is, i don''t know whether he''s an alcoholic
    since he doesn''t ever show signs of intoxication. i''ve been told that alcoholism
    is a progressive disease and that it will only increase. what constitutes an alcoholic?
    is it possible for mike to drink every day but not be one? i don''t want to lose

    i am a 47-year-old woman with a 12-year-old son. i met a wonderful man i''ll call
    "daryl," and we have been dating for about three years. we recently became engaged
    and are planning to be married this spring. i have had one concern for a while,
    and i probably should have already addressed it with him. daryl is very good about
    including my son, "kevin," in almost all of our outings, but he never asks kevin
    to do any "guy" things with him. daryl has grown sons, so it''s not like he doesn''t
    know how to do the guy thing. kevin has never had a father in his life, so he
    longs for this kind of companionship. i''m afraid if i bring it up, daryl may
    feel compelled to start doing it, but i don''t want him to do it only because
    i said something. i was hoping it was something my fiance might have wanted to
    do earlier on in the relationship. should i say something or let it take its course?

    i recently got into an argument with my mom regarding her speakerphone. i''ve
    also argued with other family members and friends over this. i believe it is rude
    to not let someone know that they are on speakerphone, particularly when others
    are present. i feel it violates trust and the sense of intimacy that comes with
    speaking to the person you intended to call in the first place. mom says it depends
    on the topic and that a "heads up! you''re on speakerphone" isn''t necessary.

    her not paying, what annoys me is she rarely says thank you after a dinner date.

    daughter without mentioning that i had bought it for her. other than her manners,

    my nephew, "logan," is a sophomore in high school. he is a bright, awesome kid
    who is on the autism spectrum. he is very high-functioning, even on a higher level
    than asperger''s. but the social struggles/issues are still there. to this day,
    my sister refuses to tell logan about his autism. she feels immense guilt and
    goes into panic mode every time i bring it up. she thinks he wouldn''t be able
    to handle it. the poor kid knows something is wrong but doesn''t know what. can
    i tell him? or if it''s morally wrong to tell him, can i tell him when he is 18?
    i am a nurse, and i strongly believe everyone should know everything about their
    conditions, mental as well as physical. but it''s tough with my nephew because
    he is still a minor. -- can i tell him?'

    my taste in music has changed throughout my life. i liked pop when i was young
    because that''s what i heard played on the car radio. then in eighth grade i started
    to like music from the ''60s to the ''90s. but now i''m a sophomore in high school,
    and i have become a fan of rap and electronic music. a lot of adults think rap
    is trash. i understand that it may cover some mature subjects like selling drugs,
    violence, sex and living in the ''hood. but i still find rap songs to be a pleasure
    to listen to. am i wrong to enjoy rap music? this may sound irrational, but i
    know employers search social media profiles. if i make the fact that i enjoy rap
    public, will they reject me? these are just thoughts that have crossed my mind,

    my husband drinks a lot. when he does, his personality changes to the point that
    i don''t want to be around him. he''s aware of this, but he continues to drink.
    recently i caught him sneaking alcohol, so i hid the bottle. when he realized
    what i had done, he retaliated by letting our cat out after dark, which we don''t
    do because of the coyotes in our area. (we recently lost a cat to them after dark.)
    after he did it, "joe" nonchalantly let me know the cat was outside. he didn''t
    say why he did it, but i figured it out. i know he''s an alcoholic, but isn''t
    this evil? it feels evil. or is it the stunted, vindictive mind of an alcoholic?

    in fact, he married her and had a baby with her! he has been lying to me since
    the day we met. i feel terrible not only for myself, but also for grant''s wife.

    i am a new bride in my mid-20s. i''m writing about my dad. at the wedding dinner,
    he read a list of reasons he "let" me get married. granted, he thought it was
    funny, and he always needs to be the center of attention. but during our honeymoon
    abroad, he sent me messages at every juncture and each hotel. maybe he''s having
    a hard time "letting go," but is this normal? frankly, i found it creepy. my honeymoon
    was my and my new hubby''s time to enjoy, and so much intrusion felt like stalking.

    many businesses these days outsource their customer service departments to phone
    centers in other countries where the person answering the phone speaks very little
    english or has a weak comprehension of the english language. please don''t get
    me wrong, they are polite, patient and try hard to be helpful, but many times
    it is difficult to get a question answered or an issue successfully dealt with
    because the person doesn''t understand what you are saying or you are having trouble
    understanding. often i have spent much of my call asking the person to repeat
    him or herself, or repeating myself to them. is there a polite way of saying,
    "hey, get me someone who speaks english"? i have never said that, but i''m often
    tempted. usually the call ends in frustration with unresolved issues. i don''t

    with the holiday shopping season already here, may i suggest another way to look

    sister 10 years ago. because their money is tight, i have been stocking their

    able to fill their freezers with enough meat to last three months or more. at
    thanksgiving, my husband and i load up our car and bring the meat with us. then
    my mom, sister, grandma and i go to the grocery store and buy staples for the
    pantry and what we need to make freezer meals. abby, this takes so much pressure
    off them. food is expensive. so instead of buying dad that new tv or sound system,
    or your sister that designer handbag, pause and take a hard look at their situation.
    sometimes the need for basics outweighs the desire for the latest and greatest
    gadgets. even paying a bill or two can help. or gift cards for groceries. i never

    my older brother and son live with me. we are all adults, so we don''t need to
    ask each other''s permission before one of us leaves the house. out of courtesy,
    i let them know where i''m going, who i''ll be with, and if i am likely to be
    out late. when i''m out, if i realize that i''ll be gone later than i thought,
    i text them. to me, this is common courtesy. my brother and son say goodbye when
    they leave, but rarely volunteer any information about their plans. i hate to
    ask, because they are adults and it''s none of my business, but it just seems
    rude. i''m often startled when they come home late and i am awakened, until i
    know it''s them and not someone breaking in. if i wake up and they aren''t home,

    when i was growing up, they used exercise as a punishment. if my brothers or i
    were late, it was 10 pushups. they also forced us to go through exercise programs.
    naturally, as soon as i was free from them, i stopped exercising altogether. i

    flattered, but thought it was "a bit much." then he said he would never tattoo
    someone''s name on himself unless he first asked permission. i told him that i
    really love him, and even if something happened and we broke up for some reason
    that it was all right. i said i am 60 years old, and it was my body and my decision,
    and that i did it for myself because i will never love another man the way i love
    him. abby, do you think i should have asked him first? do you think maybe he doesn''t

    what is the protocol for divorced parents paying for the rehearsal dinner for
    their son who is getting married? my ex-wife expects me to pay for a significantly
    bigger portion of the expenses, yet at the time of our divorce she insisted on
    splitting the assets 50/50. my opinion is that because we are equal in the parenting,
    we should divide the expenses 50/50. i''m willing to concede to her some credit
    if she does a significant amount of work and planning (over and above my own),
    but this should be negotiated ahead of time. we are both employed and have good

    i''m a 13-year-old girl in the eighth grade. i moved in with my father and his

    for any amount of time, and i have to do all the chores in the summertime. they
    also go through my phone even though they have no reason to. they post embarrassing
    pictures of me under my facebook account, take my phone away constantly (so i
    can''t talk to my friends who live far away), force me to play softball (that''s
    a big one), which i hate, etc. my privacy is nonexistent, especially considering
    how i used to live before. i feel like i have no independence. i know i can be
    disrespectful at times, but i don''t get into trouble and i don''t understand
    why they act like they do. i''m really stressed out. in the past i have gotten

    each other for almost seven years now. he is sweet, compassionate, always puts
    me first and is the best friend and romantic partner i could ever wish for. my
    question is, is two years too soon to know that i want to spend my life with him?
    we have discussed getting married and we would both like to, but i have heard
    countless stories about couples divorcing because they didn''t wait long enough
    before getting married, and i don''t want to be one of those people. please help.

    on it, becoming closer and understanding each other. but i keep getting comments

    a woman i''ll call betty jo works in my office. we are only casual acquaintances.
    we speak in passing when time permits, but she has never invited me to lunch with
    her or suggested any interaction outside the job. about three months ago, betty
    jo mentioned that she and her husband were planning a renewal of wedding vows
    and said she was going to invite me. in my mailbox at work, i found a poorly photocopied
    version of a formal invitation, with the following handwritten at the top in large
    block letters: cash gifts are cheerfully accepted! i did not plan on attending,
    since i felt that if betty jo really wanted me, she could have at least sent me
    an original invitation to my home. two weeks ago, while knitting during my lunch
    break, betty jo came up to me and asked about the item i was working on. she then
    informed me that since i hadn''t yet given her a gift, i could complete my knitting
    project and give that to her! abby, i was flabbergasted. it''s a custom-designed
    angora sweater, a gift for a cherished friend. i mumbled something about being
    "busy as a bee" with projects to complete, and since that day i have gone out
    of my way to avoid any contact with betty jo. i''ve even managed to find an office
    with a door that locks in which to take my breaks. first, am i behind the times
    or is requesting money on an invitation a new trend? second, why would this rude
    and clueless woman request such an elaborate gift from someone she barely knows?

    however, when he left his job, it felt to me like a pronouncement rather than

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my family and i are all travelers. recently, some issues have arisen with them
    about the way they regard my mode of travel. they prefer flying versus driving.
    i don''t. because of my size. i can''t fit into an airplane seat and buckle the
    seat belt without an extender. i''m always worried that i''ll be forced to buy
    an extra seat or won''t be allowed to fly because of my weight, and it is stressful.
    i have tried for years to lose weight, but have gotten only to the point where
    i''m maintaining my weight. i fit comfortably in my car. i can get the seat belt
    buckled, and i don''t have to inconvenience other passengers. my family is now
    trying to discourage me from taking future trips with them because i won''t fly.
    they claim it''s because i''m single and normally travel by myself. i''m in my
    mid-30s and have traveled solo for years. any suggestions on how to help them
    understand my choice? -- frustrated solo heavy traveler'

    my husband is in his mid-70s. we live in the pacific northwest. when the temperature
    is warm, my husband walks around the yard with his shirt off. he''s not fat, but
    he''s not thin either. he has gray hair on his chest. it looks awful and it''s
    embarrassing. i think it''s rude to the neighbor ladies who see him walk around
    like this. what do you think? -- an eyeful in washington'

    at a pool party recently, i complimented another woman on her "good figure" (she
    was wearing a bikini and looked great in it), but i was told later by a different
    woman who had been there how "hurtful" my compliment had been to everyone else
    present because i complimented only the bikini-wearing woman. i felt coerced into
    apologizing to the second woman for not offering a compliment of some kind to
    everyone else at the party -- which seems artificial and unnecessary (actually
    stupid) to me. the woman looking for the apology left me feeling steamed, and
    now i''m thinking that maybe i apologized for something i didn''t need to. is
    it true that you shouldn''t compliment one person if you can''t manage to do the
    same for everyone else present? -- pool party compliment'

    i am a retired librarian who lives in texas. i am what around here is called "anglo,"
    meaning white and not hispanic. i speak four languages, with varying degrees of
    proficiency. recently, a friend who is hispanic told me that if an anglo speaks
    spanish to a hispanic person, it''s considered an insult because it implies that
    the hispanic person is "too stupid" to learn english. i had never heard of this
    before, so i asked a retired college-level spanish teacher who is also anglo.
    she informed me that hispanic people use the language difference as a "boundary,"
    and my speaking spanish to them was a violation of their boundaries. it came as
    a complete shock! this happened more than a month ago, and i''m having a hard
    time dealing with it. i spent a lifetime developing language skills. i always
    considered speaking another language to be a sign of respect and friendship. now
    i''m being told that it''s insulting and intrusive? i can''t believe all hispanic
    people feel this way, but i don''t know what to do with this information. my next-door
    neighbors are spanish-speaking. i''ve always spoken to them in spanish because
    it''s what i heard from them when i first met them. now i don''t know if i''ve
    been insulting them. what should i do? -- in shock in san antonio'

    my wife, "jennifer," and i just finished a project and i am so peeved. we usually
    get along well. that is, until we work together. then i go from dr. jekyll to

    classes in woodworking and metal crafts. my wife has no building skills and no
    knowledge of how to use power tools. yet, only minutes after we start, she becomes
    an engineer and starts telling me how to do things. when it happens, i explode

    i live in dubai and started reading advice columns around 10 years ago. i find
    them fascinating as they give me insight into the lives of people who live in
    different cultures and have very different ways of thinking. i have learned a
    great deal from these columns and am often impressed with not just the advice,
    but also the language used in asking and answering. because i enjoy them so much,
    i spend a lot of time every day reading. some days i pore through the archives,
    and before i know it, it''s time to go home from work. when i don''t have much
    work to do in the office, it''s easy. but lately i have been procrastinating and
    only finishing tasks just before they are due. i''m fortunate that i work quickly
    and my work has not been affected negatively yet, but still, this doesn''t seem
    right. could you please help me overcome this obsession? thank you. -- addicted

    recently, we were finishing up the details on my brother''s wedding. he''s marrying
    a wedding planner who has a very rigid vision of what she wants. one of these
    ideas is mixing and matching bridesmaids dresses. all the bridesmaids were asked
    to find their own gowns in either one of the wedding colors, which was a creative
    and cute approach. the problem is, the bride has now requested that extended family
    members not wear the wedding colors so the bridal party will stand out. several
    people took offense and felt "excluded." i always thought this was a rule of etiquette,
    but others seemed unaware. is it ok for the bride to make this request? and shouldn''t
    others be ok with it? -- bewildered bridesmaid'

    my husband and i have three children. before we were married, we discussed that
    i wanted a big family. he said he didn''t want kids at all. this didn''t bother
    me because i had been told i would never be able to have children. we ended up
    not only having one "surprise" baby, but three. my dilemma is i desperately want
    to have more children. my husband has not only said no -- he''s said hell no,
    over his dead body. then he got a vasectomy. i feel i''m between a rock and a

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    during our many years of married life, we have lived in six neighborhoods. in
    two of them, there was a married couple comprised of a housewife and what i would
    call a "garaged husband." these husbands spent all their spare time working and
    puttering in their garages. one of them worked on his motorcycle and truck; the
    other rebuilt an antique truck from the ground up. both created excessive noise
    with their projects. one of the men eventually moved his bed into the garage and,
    not surprisingly, the marriage ended in divorce. the second man spends more time
    with his youngest son (who also stays in the garage most of the time) than with
    his wife. have your other readers made similar observations? is this a version
    of the "man cave" syndrome where men like to hang out? -- another husband in oregon'

    one of my relatives has become incontinent. she leaks badly. most of the time
    her pants are wet. when she comes to visit, she doesn''t hesitate to sit on my
    furniture, and when she stands up, she causes a spot on my carpet! i''m worried
    my house will start to smell. after she leaves i have to go around spraying and
    mopping. i''m sure she wears adult diapers because after she leaves we find them
    in our trash. they are soaked, so i think she probably needs to change more often.
    how do i ask her nicely not to sit on my furniture? i would love to suggest having
    her get medical help, but am afraid she would be insulted and i don''t know how
    to address it. i love her, but not her messes! -- gritting my teeth'
