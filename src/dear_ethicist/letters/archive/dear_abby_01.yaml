    i have been in a bad marriage for 40 years. i knew it was a mistake after the
    first year, but being a catholic, i accepted it as my cross. i bore eight children,
    hating every minute of it. there was never enough money, so i started teaching
    school when my youngest was 4. i''m 60 now and feel like 85. i''m sick of marriage,
    sick of my family and sick of life in general. suicide would cut off insurance
    and be hard on my family. is there a place where i can get some information on
    how to end my life and make it look like an accident? every night i pray i won''t
    wake up the next morning. helpless in hell'

    this is for all newspaper carriers, mail carriers and delivery people: when you
    see a dog, barking and growling in front of someone''s house, turn right around
    and forget that house. today, a delivery boy tried to get up to our front door
    when he was confronted by our dog on a chain, growling and snapping frantically.
    the delivery boy didn''t take the hint; instead he kept advancing, trying to get
    around the dog and up to our front door. had our dog been able to get to this
    boy, he could have done him serious damage. abby, i''m really worried. i have

    you be the judge: last night about 7 p.m. i was relaxing in my tub when my doorbell
    rang. i wasn''t expecting anybody, but i got out of the tub, wrapped a towel around
    me and peeked out my front window to see who it was. i saw a kid about 18 or 19
    years old, holding a box. i assumed he was selling something, so i said nothing
    and went back to my tub because i was not about to open my door to a stranger.
    the next morning my boss called me in and said, "yesterday i asked you if you
    were going to be home that evening and you said yes, so how come you weren''t
    home?" i told him i was home. then he told me he had sent his son to my house
    with a fruitcake his wife had made for a christmas gift, but nobody answered the
    door. i told him the truth--that i was home, my doorbell rang and i saw a kid
    on my porch but didn''t want to open my door to a stranger. he said his son drove
    clear across town for nothing; then he called me a "paranoid dummy." he really
    hurt my feelings, abby. was i wrong to do what i did? or was my boss wrong for

    a further word about taking children out of school for dental appointments: you
    recommended against it, and i agree wholeheartedly. (teachers can''t teach absent
    students any more than dentists can treat absent patients.) then "frustrated dentist"
    said: "i am a pedodontist, and my practice is totally limited to children and
    adolescents. if i were to follow your recommendation, i would have to schedule
    all my patients between the hours of 3 p.m. and 5 p.m daily. obviously, this is
    impossible." abby, that dentist missed the obvious solution. where is it written
    in concrete that 5 p.m. is quitting time? a dentist whose practice is limited
    to children should make his office hours between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. plus all day
    saturday. that way, no school is missed and everyone is happy. simple, no? bill

    it all started one day while i was walking to work. i saw this nice-looking man

    my name and where was i going. i answered him because i saw no harm in the questions
    he asked. i also asked him a few. he laughed and called himself a "health nut."
    then his questions started to get a little more personal. i always answered truthfully--like
    telling him i was married and had a 6-year-old son, but that didn''t seem to bother
    him. finally i invited him to come to my apartment anytime because my husband
    wasn''t the jealous type. he said he''d think about it, but he''d come only if

    vegetable? botanically speaking, a fruit is considered to be a mature ovary of
    a flower, which is what a tomato is. it contains seeds just as all fruits do (except
    parthenocarpic fruits, which are bred to be seedless). there are many types of
    fruit. for example, an apple is a pome fruit and a peach is a drupe fruit. a tomato
    is actually a berry! however, commonly speaking, a tomato is treated as a vegetable
    because people do not eat them like other fruits. many other vegetables that are
    botanically classified as fruits are actually vegetables. cucumber, squash, pumpkin,
    pepper and eggplant are also fruits, but are treated as vegetables. on the other
    hand, there are some vegetables that are not considered fruits. for example: brussels
    sprouts are buds, lettuce and cabbage are leaves, and broccoli and cauliflower
    are flowers! it matters little what you call them as long as you''re happy when
    you eat them. f. parivar, department of horticulture, university of illinois'

    cancer, cancer, cancer! every time i feel a lump, a bump or something that seems
    to have appeared out of the blue, i go running to the doctor to find out if it''s
    cancer. then i feel like a fool when i''m told it''s a normal part of my anatomy.
    am i crazy? i''m 25 years old and in good physical condition. i don''t smoke,
    don''t take birth control pills and i drink only on occasion. maybe i wouldn''t
    be so paranoid if somebody told me i was not a "high- risk" candidate for cancer.
    abby, what are the odds of someone like me developing cancer at my age? when should
    i go to the doctor? how long should i wait after noticing a lump, a bump, etc.?
    the american cancer society stresses the importance of early cancer detection.
    yet how can a person distinguish between possible early cancer and something that''s
    not serious without looking like a hypochondriac? please ease my mind. cancerphobic'

    when you get an invitation that reads, "join us for some christmas cheer from
    6 p.m. to 9 p.m.," what is that supposed to mean? should you arrive at 6 p.m.
    and stay until 9? or does it mean you can arrive anytime after 6 p.m., but you''re
    not supposed to stay after 9 p.m.? my husband says it means you can arrive anywhere
    between 6 and 9, but that doesn''t make any sense because if you arrive at 8:55
    p.m., you certainly wouldn''t want to leave at 9. also, what is "christmas cheer"?
    a cocktail party with hors d''oeuvres? or should you expect enough in the way
    of refreshments to call it a meal? don''t say, "call the hostess and/or the host
    and ask." that would be tacky. yet it would help a lot to know in advance what
    to expect. while i''m on the subject, when someone calls on the phone and invites
    you to a party, and you ask, "how should i dress?" i always get a vague answer

    i am the mother of a very pretty, popular, 15-year-old girl i''ll call lucy. she''s
    an honor student and has never been in any kind of trouble. her father and i had
    a rule that she couldn''t go steady until she reached 16. lucy met a boy, 16,
    from another high school, and they really fell for each other. he asked her to
    go steady and she said yes. two days later he came to meet us, and i decided to
    set the "ground rules." i thought if he knew the rules in advance he might not
    put any pressure on lucy. i told him they must be off the phone by 9 p.m. on school
    nights as she had to be up at 6, at school at 7, and she needs her rest. i told
    him she didn''t drink, that i didn''t care if he drank, but he was not to drink
    when he was with her. i told him that he should go out with his boyfriends and
    lucy would go with her girlfriends--that they shouldn''t be constant companions.
    end of conversation. well, he immediately got up and left--mad. the next night
    they had plans to see a movie. he called lucy to say he would pick her up, but
    he wouldn''t come inside the house. she felt bad. i told her to explain that we
    love her and are interested in her well-being. he thinks i don''t like him and
    that''s not true. he didn''t call lucy all week and she was heartbroken. she finally
    called him and asked what was wrong. he said he wanted to break up because he
    hadn''t felt comfortable since meeting her mom. she hung up the phone in tears
    and went to bed. i feel so guilty. was i wrong to set the ground rules on our
    first meeting? or did i just handle it wrong? how should i handle situations like
    this in the future? lucy has been very cool to me, and i haven''t slept in a week.

    i want your opinion about what i should do about this neighbor. she''s my age
    (41) and is the talk of the neighborhood for her loose and trampy ways. i found
    out she took my 15-year-old son to bed, so i went over there and told her she
    ought to be ashamed of herself for messing around with a young boy, and she said,
    "he''s no boy, he''s a man, and with a little practice he''ll be as good as his
    father." that''s when i hit her in the mouth, and her bridgework came apart. she
    threatened to sue me for assault, but so far i haven''t been served. god forgive
    me, i would like to see this evil woman dead. i have prayed and prayed, and all
    i can come up with is revenge. my priest told me i should apologize to her and
    offer to pay for the damage i did. i told him i didn''t think i could look her
    in the face, so he suggested i write her a letter. i''m not very good at that,

    i am a 69-year-old grandmother who lives alone and suffers from high blood pressure.
    last week i noticed a strange woman in my back yard, so i went out to see what
    she was doing there. it seems she lives directly behind me. she said her cat ran
    out of the house, into my back yard, and climbed to the top of my tallest pine
    tree. we both tried to coax her down, but the poor thing was too frightened to
    move. i won''t bore you with the details, but that poor cat was up in my tree
    crying piteously for three days. it turned bitter cold, so i finally telephoned
    this neighbor and said, "you must get your cat out of my tree before she freezes
    or starves to death. please call a tree man or somebody." she said, "you call
    one; i can''t afford it." she lives in a nice house and drives an expensive car,
    and this is a very affluent neighborhood. so i said, "if you can''t afford a pet,
    you shouldn''t have one," whereupon she hung up. the next morning, the cat somehow
    managed to scamper down and run home. i later learned that this neighbor telephoned
    my son''s ex-wife and said, "how in the world did you ever stand that dreadful
    mother-in-law of yours?" (my little grandchild let the cat out of the bag--no
    pun intended.) this woman invaded my property, shattered my nerves, then bad-mouthed

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    sex without strings. sex without guilt. sex without sexism. sex without old-fashioned
    legal entanglements or prerequisites or consequences. sex simply for the joy of
    sex. that was the promise and the premise of the change in sexual mores that is
    loosely dubbed the sexual revolution. but like a balloon mortgage or a no-fault
    divorce, it now appears that the advantages of the relaxation in sexual mores
    may have been disastrously oversold. now it''s turning out that sex without constraints
    isn''t the same as sex without consequences. there may well be a steep and lasting
    price to pay for what used to be called promiscuity. and as usual where sex is
    concerned, the big losers are women. what''s driving the re-evaluation of sexual
    conduct is the new and devastating outbreak of sexually transmitted disease (std)
    whose effects can include sterility, cancer, chronic pain, problem pregnancies,
    abnormal children and even death. the growing prevalence of std may make a case
    for monogamy in the minds of many who are not convinced by traditional morality.
    the term sexually transmitted disease now includes much more than the historically
    familiar syphilis and gonorrhea. now there is also genital herpes, which claimed
    half a million new victims last year and remains an incurable, lifelong affliction.
    and chlamydia, the std with the fastest-rising incidence, with 3 million to 4
    million new cases last year. and venereal warts, afflicting a million new victims
    annually and linked to increased risk of cancer. and deadly aids, which almost
    doubled in incidence in 1984 and, it is feared, could become a hazard to heterosexuals
    as well as homosexuals. all together, physicians now know of at least 25 diseases
    that are spread through sexual contact. many are occurring in epidemic numbers
    in the united states. epidemiologists estimate that about 27,000 new cases of
    std occur daily and that eventually 25 percent of all americans between the ages
    of 15 and 55 will be infected. already, medical bills for treating std top $2
    billion a year. in many cases, there is little physicians can do, no antibiotic
    to solve the problem as with gonorrhea and syphilis. the effects may not only
    last a lifetime but may be passed on, with deadly consequences, to victims'' children.
    a mother who has active genital herpes may infect her baby during the process
    of birth. more than half of these infected infants die. survivors are likely to
    be blind or have permanent brain damage. doctors can minimize the risks by scheduling
    a caesarean birth when a mother has visible herpes sores. but some damaged babies
    are born to women without obvious infections. chlamydia and venereal warts can
    also be transmitted to newborns by infected mothers with devastating results.
    and there are cases in which infants have acquired fatal aids from mothers. the
    litany of problems caused by std goes on. both chlamydia and gonorrhea, for example,
    can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can fill the fallopian tubes with
    scar tissue, increase the risk of a dangerous ectopic pregnancy and may make it
    impossible to have children. chlamydia now ranks as a significant cause of infertility
    in women. it''s ironic that the same generation of young adults who have such
    a commendable obsession with fitness and health are also producing an unprecedented
    epidemic of sexually transmitted disease. the problem can no longer be brushed
    off with a shrug about "the love bug" or finessed with one of those "personal
    ads" in which "attractive, slim single with good job and herpes seeks same for
    meaningful relationship." women, in particular, who care about the health of their
    bodies--and the well-being of future offspring--need to look realistically at
    the risks that go with multiple sex partners in the 1980s or even with an unlucky
    chance encounter, however romantic. neither dear abby nor miss manners nor even
    the centers for disease control can tell a sexually active adult a tactful, foolproof
    way to make sure a prospective sex partner won''t leave her a nasty and permanent
    souvenir of their relationship. std, in fact, is turning out to be a powerful,
    scientific reinforcement of traditional morality and--what else?--monogamy.'

    radio fame, asked his millions of radio listeners to send roosevelt a dime for
    his birthday on jan. 30. those dimes went to benefit the national foundation for
    infantile paralysis. (as a young man, roosevelt had been stricken by polio, leaving
    him partially paralyzed for the duration of his life.) dimes poured in from all
    over the country, so the campaign to collect money for research to conquer polio
    was aptly named "the march of dimes." in 1955, the salk vaccine virtually wiped
    out polio, so the march of dimes turned its efforts toward researching hereditary
    birth defects as well as surgically correcting them in newborn babies. there are
    650 march of dimes chapters nationwide that desperately need funds, so, inflation

    only now i''m accepting the fact i prefer to have sex with men," the son counters.
    "no!" screams his mother (marlo thomas). and so it goes. he wants their acceptance;
    they want him "cured," and the anguish and struggle that result will speak to
    millions, all brought to you in the very best of taste by the same concerned adults
    at abc who brought you nuclear fryface ("the day after") and father-daughter incest

    and that was a great movie that won lots of awards; so i decided to read ''consenting
    adult,'' aghayan says. "i thought it was wonderful! the story was honest and simple
    without being sensational." aghayan pitched it to some film studios, but they
    took a pass. "historically," he says, "films about homosexuals have never made
    money." then he took it to tv--to all three networks, he says--but it was dead
    meat there, too. some tv execs saw it as too hard, too controversial. others told
    him it was too soft and not controversial enough. "the climate just wasn''t right,"
    he says. now, 10 years later, the fog is lifting, just a little. "our notion of
    homosexuality has changed," aghayan says. "there are new groups, new laws and
    a new awareness that it''s not a disease, not an illness to be cured." and tv
    is seen as beginning to reflect those changes. recently, "kate & allie" pretended
    to be lovers to keep their apartment. on "hotel," robert reed played a homosexual
    sportswriter whose wife discovers he is gay. nbc''s new "sara" series also has
    a gay character. last year donna pescow played a lesbian on "all my children,"
    but that was less than three months'' work and she hasn''t returned. tony randall''s
    "love, sidney" series on nbc a few seasons back was a veiled attempt to do a gay
    guy, but no one bought the doublespeak deception, and the writing stank, too.
    meanwhile, one very funny sitcom the networks turned down because one of the "brothers"
    is gay turned out to be one of the tv success stories of 1984. after the networks
    took a pass, "showtime" took a chance, and the cable channel is so happy with
    the results, it has just committed to a record- breaking order of 50 new episodes.
    then there''s "dynasty." it''s touted as the first prime-time network show to
    allow a major character to be gay, but steven is so confused about who he is and
    what he wants, the closet he keeps coming out of is more like a revolving door.
    and what about his gay friend, luke? it''s okay for abc to crash, kill, burn and
    maim dozens of tv victims every week, but when it comes to steven and luke getting
    physical, it''s strictly a hands off affair. "hill street blues," "st. elsewhere"
    and "the love boat" also have taken a fling lately with homosexual characters,
    but only in minor roles, and only in a minor key. "consenting adult" is major.
    it explores the subject without exploiting it. the only other major tv movies
    on the subject that have come close in the last 10 years, aghayan says, are "that
    certain summer," with hal holbrook and martin sheen, and "a question of love,"
    with jane alexander and gena rowlands. " ''that certain summer'' was a leap ahead
    of anything else that had been done," aghayan says, "but it still seemed to be
    a negative view of homosexuals. it ends up with holbrook''s telling his son he
    was gay, and his being all weepy and upset and apologetic. i wanted to do something
    positive. "to me ''consenting adult'' isn''t a story about homosexuality. it''s
    a story about acceptance. and love. it''s about how we can''t change our children
    and make them over into extensions of ourselves. and it''s not just about children,
    but friends, too. if you love someone, you accept them for who they are. you can''t
    change them. it just doesn''t work." what does work is facing the truth. but that
    takes time. in the novel it takes the mother 13 years. in the tv version marlo
    thomas goes from rejection to repulsion to reconciliation in about a year and
    a half. indeed, if there is one basic flaw in the film, it''s that the mother''s
    final, final acceptance of her son happens inside her head, off screen. thomas
    wishes more time had been given to the process, but overall, she is very pleased
    with the project. "i beliehamily dares to tell the truth about himself--"i am
    a homosexual"--the whole family is shaken up. "but the son''s courage eventually
    gave the mother courage to stop telling her lies, to face up to the sexual problems
    in her marriage. the whole thing is we shouldn''t try to ''cure'' them. homosexuality
    is not a disease. we should just let people be." ''consenting adult'' to raise
    issues, but support is available several national gay and lesbian groups are commending,
    and recommending, "consenting adult," at 8 p.m. monday on abc-ch. 7. in a mailing,
    the national gay task force has encouraged members to thank abc for airing it.
    "it''s a real coming out for tv," says a representative of the alliance for gay
    and lesbian artists (agla). the los angeles-based group calls the film "an important
    tv event." in chicago these groups offer information and support on issues raised
    in "consenting adult": -- gay and lesbian horizons. a professional, peer hotline
    for young people concerned about their sexuality. call 929-help afte -- parents
    and friends of lesbians and gays (parent''s flag). recommended by dear abby. the
    hotline number is 472-3079. -- coming out workshops. rick karlin and his mother
    offer a workshoheir parents. the two may be reached through the gay and lesbian
    horizons hotline, 929-help. caption: photo: barry tubb and marlo thomas: exploring

    recently i started attending al-anon meetings to help me cope with an alcoholic
    wife. i''ve been to five meetings and have benefited greatly, but there''s a problem.
    some members resent my presence and make me feel unwelcome. why? because i suffer
    from asthma and am allergic to smoke. i am 67 years old and my doctor ordered
    me to quit smoking 22 years ago. smoke still brings on coughing spasms. some longtime
    members of the group seem to resent the fact that i, a new member, have asked
    them not to smoke during the one-hour session. one member gets up two and three
    times during the hour to go out and smoke. i am sure this disturbs the group,
    and i feel guilty. numerous organizations ban smoking. why not al-anon? i can''t
    imagine anyone so addicted to tobacco that he can''t go for one hour without a
    cigarette. don''t these people realize they have a health problem as serious (or
    possibly more so) than the alcoholic they are living with? feeling guilty'

    i had brunch on the 12th floor of the ritz-carlton hotel in chicago on nov. 18,
    1984. in the bathroom, on the floor near the commode, my sister found a gorgeous
    diamond ring. without a moment''s hesitation, she took it to the manager''s desk,
    and gave it to the manager. (he did not take her name and address.) after leaving
    the hotel for the airport, i decided to call the manager and give him my sister''s
    name. since then, we have gotten a lot of static from people we''ve told this
    to about our "stupidity." my sister called the hotel manager a week later and
    was told that nobody had claimed the ring, that the hotel would hold it for a
    year, and if it was not claimed, it would be turned over to the chicago police!
    when my sister asked why wouldn''t it be returned to her, since she had found
    it, the manager replied, "this is our policy; all you will get out of it is the
    satisfaction of knowing you did the honest thing." question: what should one do
    if one finds a valuable article in a public place? i have always believed that
    a found article, if not claimed, should be returned to the finder after a reasonable
    amount of time. i feel very uneasy about this, because i am sure that the person
    who lost this beautiful ring is heartsick, and i have the feeling that she never
    will see it again. i am signing my name, address and phone number in case you
    need it, but sign me . . . upset in st. paul, minn.'

    to clarify what has become a confusing issue concerning the tomato: if an edible
    part of a plant comes from the flower (ovary), it is a fruit. if it comes from
    any other part of the plant, it should be considered a vegetable. therefore, from
    a botanical standpoint a tomato is not "both a fruit and a vegetable" as was stated
    by mr. griesman in your column. abby, in regard to your question, "where do the
    nuts fit in?": nuts that come from the flower are fruits. this includes filberts,

    lately your column has been filled with letters from "poor widows" who are having
    a hard time coping. i, for one, am tired of these whining widows who don''t know
    how lucky they are. they cry that they are alone, but they don''t know what "alone"
    really is. i would rather have my husband dead than know that he left me for a
    cocktail waitress. that is alone! widows don''t have to live with the pain of
    rejection. widows don''t have to lie in their beds alone at night, knowing that
    their perfectly healthy ex- husband is sleeping with another woman. a widow gets
    sympathy and invitations from old friends who knew her when she had a husband.
    divorced women are avoided like they have leprosy. a widow has a better chance
    of remarrying because no man wants a woman who has been publicly dumped. (he also
    knows that a widow has the whole pie --financially--while a divorced woman has
    just a piece of the pie.) widows have no reason to cry about being alone. i see
    ads for tours and clubs for widows and widowers, but i''ve never heard of a club
    for 60-year-old rejects; have you? i know there''s no answer to this, but i feel
    better just getting it out of my system. sign me . . . divorced in seattle, or

    i''m a 17-year-old senior in a christian high school and my problem is this: recently
    i was stopped in a department store for shoplifting, but i didn''t steal anything.
    here''s the whole story, okay? i went into that store to buy some cassette tapes
    when i saw a rack of sunglasses. i tried some on, found a pair i liked, and for
    some stupid reason i stuck it in my pocket. (oh, maybe i should mention that i
    had been caught stealing in that store before, but was let off.) well, i found
    the tapes i wanted, and while paying for them, i kept thinking about all the trouble
    i got into with my family when i was caught shoplifting, and i thought to myself,
    "i don''t want to go through that again," so i headed for the sunglasses rack
    to put the sunglasses back when i was stopped by a security guard. he asked if
    i was going to pay for the sunglasses i had in my pocket. i told him no, i was
    putting them back. he took me into his office and asked me a lot of questions,
    then he told me they had me on "concealment." i asked why i was in trouble when
    i hadn''t left the store with anything i didn''t pay for, and he said that under
    maine law, concealment was the same as stealing. now i''m in big trouble with
    my family and my school administrator, too. i don''t think this is fair. i didn''t

    last week, i saw a little girl in church, holding her cabbage patch doll, looking
    around smugly to see who would envy her treasure. on the tv news i saw hundreds
    of women standing in a line blocks long, then coming to blows to get through the
    door when the store opened to sell a limited number of these dolls. the manufacturer
    is cleaning up, shrewdly making not quite enough to fill the demand--the american
    way. my children are grown and i have no grandchildren yet but, so help me, i
    will never buy one of those dolls. they have become a symbol of a sick society
    in which young women will have an abortion because of the terrible expense of
    raising a second or third child, but they''ll pay $150 to $200 and more for a
    doll whose only real "beauty" is that not everyone (except their children) can
    have one. what are we teaching our children? and what does it say about the way
    we celebrate christ''s birthday? we should be ashamed. what did i do? i took half
    the price of one of these atrocious dolls and bought a lovely "other make" doll
    for my little niece. the other half of the money i divided between the salvation
    army and the ethiopian fund at my church so some little girl could eat this christmas.

    i have been dating a man very seriously for the past year. (i''ll call him bill.)
    he and his wife have been divorced for four months. i had nothing to do with their
    break-up, but she refuses even to speak to me. the problem is that bill''s daughter
    is getting married soon, and his "ex" is totally opposed to my attending the wedding.
    i get along very well with bill''s daughter and her fiance. i have offered to
    stay away from the wedding rather than cause a family conflict. however, the bride,
    the groom and bill have invited me to attend. the bride''s mother says if i go,
    she will not. my question is, should i attend the wedding? bill''s girlfriend'

    i met a terrific guy last summer. it was love at first sight. "frankie" told me
    he worked for boeing out of seattle and lived with a couple of buddies from work.
    we saw each other only two evenings a week and saturday afternoons because he
    said he was taking some classes at night. everything was perfect until i saw his
    car parked in a shopping mall last sunday, so i waited around to see him, and
    a woman came along, opened the car with her keys and started to get in. i asked
    her what she was doing with frankie''s car, and she said she was his wife. i nearly
    had a heart attack, then i started to cry and told her the truth about me and
    frankie. she was very nice and said i wasn''t the first girl he has done that
    to, but she was hanging in there because they had two darling children. she also
    told me that frankie didn''t work at boeing; he worked in a sawmill. he told me
    he loved me and even asked me to marry him. can a man love two women at once?

    she put her dog to sleep, and she hasn''t spoken to any of us since. i know she
    has neglected to visit her aging widowed mother because there is no one available
    to sit with her dog. what is your impression of this situation? and what would

    for herself and say "no," despite what everyone else is doing. i may be considered

    i''ve been married for nearly two years to a man i went with for about a year.
    i thought we had a great marriage until i found some photos and love notes in
    his briefcase. these items were from a woman he works with. please believe me,
    i wasn''t snooping; he had gone to bed and i was looking for some postage stamps.
    i was thunderstruck. we have associated with this woman and her husband since
    we started going together, but i never suspected there was anything between her
    and my husband. my husband claims that the affair lasted for only a short time
    and it was over long before i found the items. he begged me not to talk with her
    about this, as it would make his life miserable at work, and jobs are scarce.
    after the initial shock subsided, i forgave him and agreed not to bring it up
    again. now i''m wondering if i would feel better knowing more about what happened,
    when, and for how long. or would it be better to just try to put it out of my
    mind? (it''s not easy. just because i don''t talk about it doesn''t mean i don''t

    the football season is over, but the score is not yet settled. please tell me

    attended a football game. knowing how cold it can get toward evening, i wore a
    warm coat and urged joe to do likewise. he insisted he would not get cold and
    wore a light windbreaker. fortunately, i took a blanket along--just in case. sure
    enough, the game was barely started when joe got cold, so i gave him the blanket.
    meanwhile, a young woman in her mid-20s who we know only by sight sat down beside
    my husband. she was wearing only a sweatshirt and a pair of jeans, and kept commenting
    on how cold it was. at halftime i went for coffee. when i returned, i found my
    husband and this young woman under the blanket! (they didn''t even notice that
    i had returned.) after being ignored for about 15 minutes, i excused myself with
    a headache and went to the car. i later learned that while i was gone, joe''s
    boss came by and mistook the young woman under the blanket for our married daughter,
    and when he learned she wasn''t, he was startled. now joe blames me for going
    to the car and making him look bad. he said his boss has been acting cool to him

    i would like to put in my 2 cents about that 41-year-old woman who took a 15-year-old
    neighbor boy to bed. what''s all the commotion about? all right, so a 15-year-old
    boy is a minor in the eyes of the law, but there are a lot of boys that age who
    are man enough to seek a sexual relationship. in my day, it wasn''t unusual for
    a boy''s father to pay a high-class prostitute to educate his son. it may not
    be the ideal solution, but it''s preferable to having the kid talk some inexperienced
    14-year-old girl into taking care of his normal sex urges. michigan grandpa, age

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    jealousy is bad for the soul. your clergyman probably would tell you so. dear
    abby would say the same thing. jealousy is also very human. therefore, let''s
    talk salaries. several years ago, a paperback called "reel facts: the movie book
    of records" published a list of movie star''s salaries. the trade publication
    "the hollywood reporter" condensed the list and ran it in its recent 54th anniversary
    issue. some of the statistics are not that envy-provoking to the average citizen,
    however. it has long been known, for example, that vivien leigh received only
    $17,000 for the arduous scarlett o''hara role in "gone with the wind." the role
    made her career, and $17,000 covered more ground in 1939 than it does today. one
    also must take into consideration that managers and agents had to be paid out
    of any star''s salary. (it may have irritated leigh ever-so- slightly to know
    that for playing rhett butler, clark gable was rewarded with $4,500 a week plus
    a $50,000 bonus.) kim novak''s case represents the inequities of ironclad contracts.
    incredible as it seems today, the beautiful but not-overly-talented novak was
    a major star of the 1950s. you wouldn''t know it from her salary. she was under
    contract to columbia pictures, a studio not known for its generosity in the good
    old days. in 1955, when she was getting started, she was earning $75 a week. when
    she had several hits to her name, the studio raised her to $100 a week. when united
    artists wanted to borrow her for "the man with the golden arm," they had to pay
    columbia $100,000, although kim still was earning only $100 a week at the time.
    elizabeth taylor was luckier. in 1952, she was earning $5,000 a week. she has
    said several times that she didn''t want to do "cleopatra" and therefore made
    extravagant salary demands of 20th century-fox, thinking the studio would laugh
    in her face. instead the studio met her demands, and liz got her chance to costar
    with richard burton. queen elizabeth''s "cleopatra" contract called for a straight
    $125,000 for 16 weeks'' work. however, the film went into a lengthy overtime shoot,
    and liz was paid $50,000 for every week of overtime. she also got 10 percent of
    the film''s gross (which is much more generous than getting a percentage of the
    profits). through it all, she had a $3,000-a-week expense account. percentages
    help enormously. bette davis'' career was skidding when she lucked out with "whatever
    happened to baby jane?" she agreed to $25,000 for "baby jane," but it''s rumored
    that her percentage of the substantial profits put her over $1 million for the
    film. dustin hoffman received a straight salary of $3 million for the hit "tootsie."
    however, reports on his percentage deals for "tootsie" have listed his eventual
    take at over $15 million. earlier in his career, he had been paid $17,000 for
    "the graduate," $250,000 for "midnight cowboy" and $425,000 for the almost-forgotten
    "john and mary." it''s interesting that while hoffman was paid $250,000 for "midnight
    cowboy," costar jon voight, then an unknown, was paid $17,000 for the same picture--the
    exact amount hoffman had been paid when he did "the graduate" as an unknown. actually,
    $17,000 seems to be a lucky number. vivien leigh got it for "gone with the wind."
    dustin hoffman got it for "the graduate." jon voight got it for "midnight cowboy."
    frank sinatra, hitting the comeback trail, got it for "from here to eternity."
    sean connery also got $17,000 for "dr. no." however, when subjecting himself to
    the rigors of playing james bond one final time in "never say never again," he
    asked for--and got--$4 million. "the godfather" made several reputations and remade
    marlon brando''s. in 1957, he had earned $300,000 plus a percentage for "sayonara."
    in 1972, he agreed to $250,000 plus a percentage for "the godfather." the movie,
    to put it mildly, was a success. recent reports have placed his take at more than

    i come from a very large family, but there is one sister with whom i have always
    been particularly close. i''ll call her mary. we''ve always confided things to
    each other that we wouldn''t share with anybody else. six months ago i learned
    that mary had been telling a close male friend of hers some of the very personal
    things i had shared with her. when i confronted her, she admitted betraying my
    confidence, tearfully apologized and promised it would never happen again. i told
    her i forgave her but didn''t feel i ever could confide in her again. she said
    she understood my feelings and didn''t blame me. mary continues to confide the
    most intimate details of her private life, hoping i''ll reciprocate. i just can''t.
    the trust is gone. when we''re together with the family, mary''s laughter is forced,
    her brightness is artificial and she is obviously ill at ease in my presence.
    the family has picked up on this and keep asking me what is wrong. when i refuse
    to say, they see me as the one who is to blame. how do i answer their questions?
    and how can i make mary return to her natural self? betrayed'

    my husband went to a dentist for a new set of dentures. the terms were cash in

    and i was so upset i never got around to calling the dentist to tell him to stop
    work on the dentures. when i called a few weeks later, he told me it was too late,
    they were already finished. i told him i didn''t have any use for them, and he
    said neither did he, but since they were paid for, somebody might as well pick

    someone asks, "what do you do when grandparents forget their grandson''s birthday?"
    your idiotic response: "gently remind them of the oversight. and next year, remind
    them about two weeks in advance of the date." i can''t believe you. why should
    anyone be "reminded" to remember somebody''s birthday? just because the grandchildren
    happen to be relatives doesn''t mean their grandparents have to remember them,
    or even like them. many of the ill- mannered, undisciplined kids of today are
    hard to take. we have sent many gifts and generous checks to our six grandchildren
    for their birthdays. in five years we received only one thank-you. people (even
    kids) have a way of remembering what they want to remember. if they "forget" to
    say "thank you," the givers who are never thanked can also "forget" to give the
    next time a birthday rolls around. forgetting by choice'

    as a member of the clergy, i am asking you to print this on behalf of those of
    us who are asked to officiate at weddings. i have been told that it is customary
    for pastors to attend both the rehearsal dinner and the reception. others have
    told me that they invite the pastor only because they think they have to. i''ve
    been told by some folks that they would prefer that the pastor didn''t attend
    the rehearsal dinner. i am aware of the expense involved in having a wedding.
    i''m also aware that some folks feel awkward around clergy; so i am calling upon
    you, dear abby, to tell couples to be straightforward about their expectations.
    i enjoy wedding festivities, but i would like to know in advance whether i''m
    invited. i am not married, and i often end up attending alone when i would have
    enjoyed bringing a friend. my married clergy friends say they never know whether
    their wives or husbands are invited to the rehearsal dinner and wedding reception.
    so, abby, the questions many clergy would like to have answered are: 1. do you
    want me to be present at the rehearsal dinner? 2. do you want me to be present
    at your wedding reception? 3. may i bring my spouse or a friend? abby, i cannot
    count the number of times i am half out the door following a wedding rehearsal

    wasn''t invited.) any advice you can give us would be appreciated. confused member

    "no, sir." later on, the young man won a trip to hawaii for two, so the host asked
    if he had someone to go with him, and the contestant replied, "yes, sir." when
    the host was signing off, he said, "and please don''t call me ''sir'' anymore,

    i''m terribly upset because my husband forgot valentine''s day. i used to drop
    subtle hints before my birthday, anniversary, etc., but it never did any good,
    so i started to come right out and ask him to please remember me. even that didn''t
    help. the week before valentine''s day i reminded him that i would just love a
    card, a rosebud or some cute earrings. i reminded him again the day before, but
    the next day when i gave him his valentine''s day gift, he just stared at me stupidly
    and said, "gee, i guess i should have gotten you something, huh?" the same thing
    happens every birthday and anniversary. last mother''s day was my first (our baby
    is 6 months old), so the day before, i told my husband i''d like a card, breakfast
    in bed, or just being able to sleep in while he looked after the baby. i would
    have been thrilled with any one of these gifts, but i got nothing. instead he
    went bowling. i am so disappointed when he forgets. i end up crying myself to
    sleep. do you have any suggestions? hurt in albany, ore.'

    your answer to "mother of the groom" was totally off-base. you said the stepmother
    should not have been in the receiving line at all. abby, in some cases, a stepparent
    most certainly should be in the receiving line. some stepparents play an important
    role in the stepchild''s life. questions such as "how long has the stepfather
    been remarried?" and "with whom do the children live?" were not answered in the
    letter. the relationship between the stepparent and the child or his or her new
    spouse must also be considered. it''s their wedding, and they should have a say
    in the matter. stepparent-to-be'

    the letter signed "just woke up in california" moved me to tears. the writer,
    who had always given his elderly mother expensive gifts, vowed to give her a gift
    of himself--to spend more time with her and to tell her in so many words that
    he loved her while he still had time. my 90-year-old mother lived with me until
    she died a year ago. for 20 years i had been her shopper, chauffeur, confidant,
    mainstay, etc., and i''m sure she knew from my actions that i loved her very much,
    but only once since i was a grown man did i say, "i love you, mother"--and that
    was on her deathbed. so, i also just woke up and have promised myself that when
    i marry, i shall verbally convey such loving feelings to my wife, something i
    failed to do for my mother. thanks for listening. and thank you, abby, for teaching

    recently i found a letter my 10-year-old daughter had written to a boy at school.
    giving in to sudden impulse, i read the letter and was shocked to find that it
    was a love letter! when i told her that i had read it and thought we should have
    a talk, she was angry at me for "sticking my nose in her business." i apologized
    for violating her privacy and explained that i felt that she was my business.
    i also told her that she was much too young for a sexual relationship, but apparently
    she is already sexually active. i am worried sick! my daughter--my "baby"--may
    be only 10, but she could easily pass for 14. how can i prevent her from becoming
    promiscuous? her letter to that boy was unbelievable, abby. i was an unwed mother
    at 16, and i don''t want history to repeat itself with my daughter. concerned
    in sacramento.'

    my doctor is always late. i have tried taking his first appointment of the day,
    but invariably he is at least 45 minutes late. i''ve tried making later appointments,
    but it''s even worse; in addition to starting late, he falls behind. i''m a working
    person, and time off costs me money. where does he get off wasting my time and
    costing me money? he''s a very good doctor and i like him, but i am fed up. don''t

    the whole town is talking about two brothers, ages 9 and 11, who were suspended
    from using the school bus for five days because they created a disturbance on
    the bus. the boys'' parents refused to drive them--they made the boys walk 14
    miles a day to teach them a lesson. it got into the newspapers all over the nation,
    and the parents received phone calls from california, wisconsin, florida and switzerland,
    from people calling to congratulate them. the parents said they told their sons
    that if the type of behavior that got them kicked off the bus in the first place
    ever occurred again, they''d be walking for 10 days instead of five. the boys''
    father said he followed them in his car to assure their safety. personally, i
    think making kids that age walk 14 miles a day borders on child abuse. how do
    you feel about it? j. in conway, ark.'

    i am 59 and the lady i am marrying is 50. this is the second marriage for both

    toasters, two steam irons, two blenders, etc., and we do not need any more things.
    i would like to insert the following in our wedding invitations: "we do not need
    any wedding gifts, so instead of registering for china and silver with a department
    store, we have registered with the ( ) travel bureau for a seven-day cruise. "you

    cruise would be more practical? sign me . . . longing for the love boat'

    if you can tolerate one more letter regarding the lady who found a diamond ring
    in a chicago hotel, i would like to tell you what is going on in kentucky. unlike
    illinois, kentucky doesn''t have an estray statute that specifies the rights of
    finders. as a result, the law is unsettled and sometimes unfair. a recent case
    involved a young student who found $35,000 cash in a brown paper bag in the garbage
    can at his college. he did the honest thing and turned in the money. despite his
    good deed, the kentucky court of appeals recently ruled that he would not receive
    one cent for his honesty because he couldn''t prove that the original owner intended
    to abandon the money. this proof would be difficult to present because the true
    owner has never been heard from. many people are hopping mad about the legal system''s
    treatment of this young man. unless the laws are fashioned to protect finders
    of lost property, honest people like the lady in chicago and the young man in
    louisville will be discouraged from turning in the valuables they find, making
    those who have been innocently separated from their property the biggest losers
    of all. concerned citizen, louisville, ky. do you hate to write letters because

    i am a 23-year-old male student nurse. recently i met representatives from several
    hospitals and learned that my chances for employment are excellent--but my chances
    for the jobs of my choice range from poor to nonexistent. why? because i am a
    man. some hospitals will not hire a male r.n. for general medical-surgical duty
    because male nurses are not allowed to perform routine care of female patients
    without a female nurse being present. obviously this is not cost- effective if
    two nurses must be in the room while only one is necessary. on obstetrics-gynecology
    service, the male r.n. is simply not allowed in most hospitals because "intimate
    care" is required. at least that''s how it was explained to me. female nurses
    take care of male patients (even on urological services), and no chaperones are
    required. is this discrimination practiced all over the country? or is new england
    behind the times? i also would be interested in knowing how your female readers
    feel about having a male r.n. care for them in the hospital. m.b.e.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a strong, healthy woman of 34. i just had a complete physical examination
    and passed with flying colors, so after my doctor gave me a clean bill of health,
    i went to the red cross blood donor center to build up a blood bank for my family.
    guess what? i was turned down. why? because i don''t weigh enough. i weigh 99
    pounds and i''m 4 feet 11. i am not underweight for my height. i have four children,
    and i wanted so much to build up a blood bank in case someone in my family needs
    a transfusion. i''d feel so much better knowing it was my blood they were getting.
    doesn''t that make sense to you, abby? please print this. maybe the red cross
    will change the rules about donating blood. thanks from . . . charleston, w.va.'

    voter registration may not be necessary in north dakota, but there are valid reasons
    why registration is important in other states. in ohio, we have 7.8 million people
    of voting age--that''s 15 times the number in north dakota. in our state, registration
    is necessary to prevent voting fraud and maintain an orderly electoral system.
    we have a long record of fair and efficient elections. in ohio, citizens can register
    everywhere from state park campgrounds to fast-food restaurants. our system works
    for us. obviously, states with large populations have to take precautions that
    smaller states may not need. doesn''t that seem logical, abby? sherrod brown,

    i am hurting more right now than i ever have in my whole life. my beloved younger
    sister died nine months ago. i still can''t believe i never will be able to call
    her on the phone again to gossip and giggle as only sisters do. god, how i miss
    her! i asked her doctor what actually killed her, and without batting an eye he
    said, "cigarettes!" now i feel so guilty because she took up smoking because i,
    her older sister, smoked. thank god, i was able to quit in time. she tried to
    quit, but it was too late for her. her husband and children are inconsolable.
    i have learned a lot from this terrible experience. a smoker has a lot more to
    worry about than dying. my sister''s stay in the hospital with lung cancer wiped
    out her family financially. abby, why do advertisers make cigarette ads so attractive?
    instead, they should run before-and-after pictures of a once-beautiful woman vomiting
    and bald from radiation therapy. i know this letter is too long for your column,
    but if it will help just one person to reach into her purse (or his pocket) and
    throw that pack of cigarettes in the trash, it will be worth it. grieving in gulfport,

    to a crime. interestingly, king james i, after whom a version of the english bible
    was named, wrote a famous pamphlet titled, "counter blast to tobacco." he would
    have liked to have made the use of tobacco both sinful and criminal, but in spite
    of his throne and his title of defender of the faith, even king james could not
    make smoking either a crime or a sin. many thanks for your constructive, entertaining

    this is regarding your answer to "deceived," the young wife who was upset when
    she found some girlie magazines her husband had hidden from her. she said that
    she was a good-looking woman and couldn''t understand why her husband would want
    to look at pornographic filth like that. i was surprised at your answer. you said,
    "please get over the notion that only men with unattractive wives read girlie
    magazines. what you look like has nothing to do with your husband''s desire to
    look at what you call ''filth.'' " then you defended the husband''s right to read
    whatever he wanted to, and told the wife she had a lot to learn about why men
    enjoy looking at stuff like that. abby, i don''t understand why a happily married
    man would want to look at pictures of naked women, so i asked my husband, and
    he said it was normal and natural for men to enjoy pictures of beautiful naked
    women regardless of what they have at home. abby, i consider myself normal, and
    i have absolutely no desire to look at pictures of naked men, no matter how well-built
    they are. why? puzzled in chicago'

    your advice is usually good, but you were dead wrong when you advised "a sinner
    in my heart" to switch to another parish when her ex- boyfriend ("john") returned
    after 16 years to become her parish priest. although "sinner" says she''s happily
    married, she admits to having strong feelings for john, and suspects the feeling
    is mutual because he cannot look her in the eye. meanwhile, she is consumed with
    guilt because she can''t bring herself to confess to him that she is lusting after
    him in her heart. abby, we do not solve our problems by running away from them.
    if "sinner" switches to another parish, she would create more problems than she
    would solve. how would she explain the sudden switch to her family? better for
    her to stay where she is and face the music. her "strong feelings" will pass with
    time if she will pray for strength and diligently practice the art of self-control.
    both she and the priest should be able to engender sufficient faith and determination
    to bring them victoriously through this crisis. the rev. c.w. kirkpatrick, hatfield,

    all the employees of the restaurant where i recently took a job as cashier went
    to a nightclub to celebrate the birthdays of those of us who were born in march.
    first a young girl came out and did a singing telegram number that turned out
    to be a striptease, but that wasn''t too bad. then a man ran out on the stage
    wearing a false face mask with long gray hair attached to it. he danced around,
    removing first his mask, next his shirt, then his shoes and socks. then he took
    off his trousers, revealing a pair of shorts on which was printed some vulgar
    messages. he continued his dancing, left the stage and came out into the audience
    making a lot of sexy movements, twisting his buttocks in everybody''s face. pretty
    soon he was down to a g-string, and when that came off he was bare naked except
    for a garter around his neck! i''ve been married for 18 years, and the only man
    i''ve ever seen naked was my husband. if i had been told what was coming and asked
    if i wanted to leave, i would have left, but i had to sit there for the whole
    show, which lasted 30 minutes. the entire audience was laughing and screaming.

    when i was a 16-year-old girl, i discovered a semi-concealed peephole in the wall
    of a ladies rest room at a gasoline station. the hole had been strategically drilled
    at a level that would afford the "viewer" on the other side of the wall a pretty
    good peep show. since then i have examined the walls of hundreds of gas station
    rest rooms and have found a surprising number of peepholes. i think gas station
    owners who are aware of this disgusting invasion of privacy should be held accountable
    by law. what agency should i contact to put a stop to this? and if i can''t do
    anything to stop it, perhaps a letter in your column will alert women to the fact
    that they may be inadvertently the "star" of some creep''s peep show. disgusted

    you often advise people to talk to counselors, but let me ask you something: can
    counselors help people decide whether to have children or not? i''ve seen two
    counselors about this problem, and they were no help at all. they''ve seen so
    many kids with problems that their stock answer is: "when in doubt--don''t." i
    could be happy with or without kids, but my husband loves kids and he would make
    a wonderful father. i like kids, too, but they walk all over me; i''ve never been
    able to exercise authority over anyone. even 2-year-olds push me around. i told
    this to one counselor, and he said, "if you had a kid, by the time he was 10,
    he''d be kicking your rear end." what do you think? should i take a chance and
    leave all the disciplining to my husband? weak in waterloo, iowa'

    i have never seen this problem in your column, but i know i''m not the only person

    something to say. however, my problem is not that i am quiet, it''s people who
    introduce me and add, "she''s very quiet" or "maybe you can get her to talk."
    then there are those who in the presence of others loudly ask, "why are you so
    quiet?" i would never ask a person who talks a lot, "why are you so loud?" yet,
    quiet people are constantly asked, "why are you so quiet?" abby, people who are
    quiet are usually shy and lacking in confidence, which is difficult enough to
    deal with without having it pointed out in public. i am working on overcoming

    asked joe if he had ever been to bed with joyce. he said yes, but that was before
    he met me. well, i just freaked out. i refused to socialize with joyce, and i
    told her why. joe thinks i''m being childish and selfish, but i can''t help it.
    every time i look at joyce i visualize her in bed with my joe, and i can''t handle
    it. the foursome is broken up, and jack doesn''t know the real reason. joyce told

    your curt response to the grandparents who told their son-in- law that his son

    of being. if you were in a burning building, would you be insulted by a warning

    it would behoove us all to examine and re-examine our beliefs. for just because
    the constitution of the united states guarantees us freedom to worship god in
    any manner that we choose, it does not guarantee that god will be pleased with
    that choice. we must put aside the popular misconception that as long as we are

    in response to "cut off in virginia": how sad that a christian couple alienated

    problems, "cut off" should thank god that she has a healthy grandchild with loving

    barton stone, was a presbyterian, and the purpose of the christian church was
    to unite christians. your advice was strong, but as usual, excellent. religious

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    in reply to the 99-pound woman who wanted to be a blood donor, all blood-collecting
    organizations have agreed on basic health requirements for blood donors, and one
    of these is that a donor must weigh 110 or more to donate a pint of blood. the
    amount of blood a person has in his body is directly proportional to his size,
    and one pint of blood represents more than 13 percent of the total blood volume
    in a person weighing less than 110 pounds. removing this much blood in a very
    short time (5-10 minutes) may well cause the donor to have a serious reaction.
    it is for the protection of the donor that this rule was established. as you pointed
    out, it is not possible to "build up a blood bank" for one''s family. red blood
    cells last only 35 days; platelets, which are necessary for blood clotting, last
    only 7 days; and plasma, when frozen, is usable for only one year. people who
    are concerned about their family''s future needs should help the american red
    cross by donating blood and, in addition, by recruiting family members, friends
    and fellow workers to become regular blood donors to ensure that there is always
    a safe and adequate blood supply available for all patients who need it. shirley

    are male nurses discriminated against? this is the way it is in vancouver, wash.:
    hospitals have nurses'' lounges--but the males aren''t allowed to use them. female
    nurses are often provided with uniforms and laundry service--males aren''t, unless
    they want to wear the "scrub" uniforms, which lack the crisp, professional appearance
    most nurses like to maintain. a male''s sexuality is always suspect. many female
    nurses assume that a male nurse must be somehow "less of a man"--otherwise he''d
    be a doctor, not a nurse. it''s amusing to see the slightly shocked expression
    with which one nurse meets another nurse''s wife for the first time. how do i

    love your column, abby, but might i suggest eating crow rather than cake for allowing
    a nasty misquote to slip by? a letter on the etiquette for eating wedding cake
    ended by attributing "let them eat cake" to marie antoinette. this much maligned
    queen had too much class to utter such a remark. in the sixth book of his "confessions,"
    written in 1766, jean jacques rousseau refers to an incident that happened in
    1740, 15 years before marie antoinette was born: "at length i recalled the thoughtless
    remark of a great princess, who, when she was told the peasants had no bread,
    replied, ''let them eat cake.'' " in the dictionary of misinformation, author
    tom burnam notes the writing of alphonse karr, who in 1843 explained that a duchess
    of tuscany supposedly uttered the remark in 1760. karr contended the quote was
    used to discredit marie antoinette. serious biographers of the queen do not even
    grace the remark with a comment. as a newspaper editor, i hate to see such dubious--and
    ugly--statements creep into print. and i have a more personal reason as well:
    i am the great-great-great- grand son of the man who claims to be her son, the
    lost dauphin, louis xvii. as the inheritor of a family legend, i have been compelled

    cards and gifts on special occasions. (a gift that''s begged for is not really

    song of the meadowlark, that is a gift! when he takes me for a ride in the mountains

    watch a football game on tv, that is a gift! i could go on and on, but i think

    what should a woman do when a man gives her an engagement ring while proposing
    marriage, and she doesn''t like the ring? don''t get me wrong, i love the man,
    but i don''t care for the ring. must i wear the ring the rest of my life and not
    let on that i don''t like it? or should i ask him, as tactfully as possible, to
    exchange it for a style more in keeping with my taste? i''ve heard several opinions.

    a number of years ago, we bought a home in a nice, quiet, high-class neighborhood.
    now one of our neighbors has made it look like a cheap flea market! she has one
    yard sale after another, which brings a lot of people in front of my house as
    well as hers. believe me, she doesn''t need the money. the traffic is annoying,
    and so is the noise. and it looks terrible! last summer she started selling vegetables
    from their small back-yard garden, with signs all over the yard. now i think this
    is really tacky! i am annoyed! what can i do outside of filing a complaint with

    i had a blind dinner date with a man i''d been hearing about for ages. we clicked
    immediately. i liked his looks, personality and everything about him. after we
    talked for 15 minutes, it was as though we had known each other all our lives.
    during cocktails i took a cigarette out of my purse and instead of offering me
    a light, he said, "you may as well know up front, i hate cigarette smoke." i told
    him that i enjoyed smoking, but if it bothered him, i''d go to the powder room
    to smoke, which is what i did. after i returned, we had a wonderful dinner, then
    i took out another cigarette, excused myself and went to the powder room for a
    smoke. i was back in less than five minutes. when he took me home, he said, "thanks
    for a wonderful evening. i think you''re a terrific woman, and i''m very much
    attracted to you." then he hugged me affectionately. (i was on cloud 9!) "not
    even a goodnight kiss?" i teased, whereupon he replied, "i don''t think i''d enjoy
    kissing a woman who smokes as much as you do." (abby, two cigarettes in four hours?)
    it has been 10 days, and i can''t get that man off my mind; we seemed so right
    for each other. i''d really like to see him again. any advice? j. in jersey.'

    recently you printed a true-false quiz, "how much do you know about homosexuality?"
    you said all the statements in the quiz were false. i believe one statement is
    true: "if a person is gay, no amount of therapy or motivation can change him."
    my own study of bisexual or homosexual husbands (to be published soon) is the
    only study of married gays with a six-year follow-up. not one of the married men
    in our sample, despite years of "normal" married sex, has overcome the desire
    to be with men. if you have information with which i am not familiar, i would
    like to see it. if not, please eliminate that question, as it encourages homosexuals
    to seek useless therapy from counselors who have not reviewed the research carefully,
    and perhaps because of their own homophobia, or just from ignorance, try to "help"
    the homosexual. the effect is (besides the loss of time and money) to delay accepting
    (hopefully affirming) a gay identity. david matteson, ph.d.'

    six months ago, my husband and i bought a lovely old home from an estate. the

    an envelope containing $700 in cash, and several pension checks made out to the

    was at my door to pick up the envelope. he didn''t stay 30 seconds, and never

    should have kept the money, that the dining room set was sold with the house,

    an expensive piece of jewelry was taken from our home recently. the sad part is

    our young relative might break down under questioning, which would cause very

    i don''t have a problem, but you seem to have one. the answer you gave to "i am

    evolved from the reptile family approximately 100 million years ago. reptiles

    from the reptiles. of course, the egg you laid in your column when you cited the

    i thought that surely the school bus case was closed, but i feel compelled to
    respond to "saddened psychologist," who took the parents to task for making their
    9- and 11-year-old sons walk 14 miles a day to and from school after they had
    been kicked off the school bus for misconduct. obviously "saddened" was city-born
    and never held a job that required physical labor or overtime. what difference
    is there in walking seven miles to school as punishment and getting up before
    dawn every day to do farm chores? i''m sure the farm kids of our country are still
    doing some of the same things i did while growing up on a farm. i fed the chickens
    (all 3,000 of them), milked cows and cut broccoli in the field for market before
    sunrise. and how about the thousands of kids who are up before dawn delivering
    newspapers, then come home for breakfast before going to school? "saddened" said
    that a 10-hour day was out of line. many young people are so involved in sports,
    they spend at least four hours outside their school day, either practicing or
    participating in one sport or another. this requires more energy than walking
    14 miles a day, and it''s not for only five days, it''s for months and years.
    i wonder how "saddened" thinks high school and college students who also happen
    to hold down full-time jobs manage to make it? nell in louisville'

    i thought you might want to hear from someone on the side of the parents who made
    their kids walk to school. i lived a mile from school. my mother drove, but she
    didn''t drive me. she insisted that i walk. my friends'' mothers drove them and
    i thought my mother was being mean by making me walk, so i asked her why she didn''t
    drive me to school. she put her arms around me and said: "if i drive you, how
    will you learn, and have time to think? walk, and learn, dear." well, i walked,
    and learned to love the smell of rain in the air and the feel of it on my face.
    i learned the feeling of snow crunching under my feet. i did a lot of thinking
    while i walked. it helped me to think things out instead of making quick decisions.
    i also met some nice people on the way. the lady who gave me a flower for my mother
    from her garden, the old man who was always waiting by his mailbox for a letter

  subject: LIFETIME SETS OUT TO BE THE TALK OF CABLE TELEVISION
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    lifetime cable television network already has stanley seigel, who infuriates as
    much as he fascinates; richard belzer, who might say anything at all; and dr.
    ruth westheimer, who talks about sex the way julia child talks about cooking.
    but lifetime isn''t satisfied. the network is combing the country for a nosy person
    with connections and for a pretty face to gossip about very important people in
    hollywood. it''s all part of what lifetime president thomas f. burchill called
    "a $25 million road map to success," $20 million for programming and $5 million
    for marketing in a bid to get lifetime into focus and to build an audience of
    women and yuppies who will attract advertising dollars. lifetime, born feb. 1,
    1984, in the merger of viacom''s old cable health network and hearst/abc''s daytime,
    almost didn''t make it out of the incubator. "the programming menu was the best
    of cable health network and the best of daytime," said burchill, who came aboard
    in april with a mandate to get the operation in focus and to give it an image.
    "that was fine, except that it sort of left a hodgepodge of fare on the air."
    burchill''s formula for success consisted of turning lifetime into the cable industry''s
    first "talk television" network. since then, his subscriber base has grown from
    16 million households at launch to 24.5 million served by 2,458 cable systems
    nationwide. "we can''t be no. 1," burchill said. "the business plan doesn''t call
    for us to be no. 1. it''s simply to have an identity and a loyal audience and
    deliver the woman and the young professional. we want to stand out. we want there
    to be a singleminded benefit, which is when you come to lifetime, you''ll know
    what you''re going to get." what the viewer gets, in addition to regis philbin,
    richard simmons and concentrated doses of parenting from dr. barry brazelton and
    joan lunden, who moonlights for the network when her daily stint on "good morning
    america" is over, never would be found on commercial television. the talk television
    concept, with audience call-in capability from 50 states, was kicked off with
    westheimer, a bubbly, candid sex therapist whose sole theme is celebrated as "good
    sex!" mary alice dwyer-dobbin, lifetime''s programming vice president, admitted
    the network approached westheimer''s debut the way it might approach an angry
    rattlesnake. "there were some among us who were very nervous," she said. "there
    was concern that we would offend our advertisers and offend our affiliates and
    offend our audience. there were concerns that the subject matter, and dr. ruth''s
    explicitness, just might be too much. now that she''s been on the air a year,
    i think we could count on the fingers of one hand the number of complaints we''ve
    gotten. america has taken her to its heart." burchill, who called westheimer "the
    dear abby of the ''80s," said the diminutive doctor of the sexual hang-up proved
    to be the hottest property in the cable industry. "we give cable operators two
    minutes of local (advertising) avails in every program and dr. ruth is the no.
    1 selling in all cable," he said. "she is selling quicker locally than she is
    nationally. on cable television, she can be herself. stanley can be himself, which
    is outrageous--you may not love him, but you''ll watch him. that''s what we offer,
    and that''s what works for us." what dwyer-dobbin hopes will work equally well
    are a sports-talk format with a celebrity host yet to be designated and a hollywood
    gossip columnist with a tongue sharp enough to raise the ghosts of louella parsons
    and hedda hopper. "who is that next entertainment news personality who''s going
    to come along?" she wondered aloud. "rona barrett certainly is the predominant
    figure, but i''m not sure that rona is right for us. rex reed is another type
    who comes to mind, but i''m not sure that he''s right for us either. i think we''re
    looking for somebody new who can carve out that new, yet undetermined, niche in
    the field." to further spur his network''s "uptick" ratings, burchill has added
    a sweepstakes in which viewers can win prizes by calling in. next year, lifetime
    will broaden its financial base by charging cable systems 6 cents per subscriber,
    to be followed by 7 cents in 1987 and 8 cents in 1988--a move that will increase
    a subscriber''s overall basic cable package by about 50 cents a month. but dwyer-dobbin
    said "outrageous" will continue to be lifetime''s style. "we are trying to get
    the audience out there to sit up and take notice," she said. "we''re not trying
    to present staid, straightforward, dull talk shows. we want excitement there.
    if you consider the results of some of our programming strategies to be outrageous,
    yes, maybe we are trying to get some mileage out of that."'

    my sister is 91 years old and no longer sufficiently mentally competent to handle

    contribution and asking for more money. abby, she thought these candidates were
    writing personal letters to her, so she sent them whatever they asked for. she
    was handing out checks left and right. last january she became very ill, both
    mentally and physically. she had to give up her apartment and come and live with

    she gave money to. i wrote them, explaining the situation and demanding that they

    i have this problem that has been on my mind for quite some time. i am married
    to a wonderful, hard-working man. we both work, but barely make ends meet between
    us. i am 48 and my husband is 51. for the last six years i have been seeing a
    respectable, well-to-do, 74- year-old gentleman who has a living wife. he dearly
    loves me, and we get together for a few hours at his friend''s apartment at least
    one afternoon a week. i accept no money or gifts from him, but he told me that
    in his will he is leaving me his fine home and all the furnishings. i am now wondering
    how this will go over with his family if he should die before his wife? wouldn''t
    they wonder why he is being so good to me? his wife knows nothing about us, and
    this could be a terrible shock to her. i don''t want to ask him to leave me out
    of his will because i could sure use whatever he wants to leave me, but i don''t
    want him to muddy his name or mine after he''s gone. what should i do? worried.'

    thank "gail of shorewood, wis.," who is tired of hearing the word "basically"
    used and overused incorrectly. my family and i have made a game of counting the
    times a person uses "basically" in one speech or commmentary. i have counted as
    many as eight "basicallys." it means "as a basis for" or "fundamentally," but
    it''s now used as a filler and means nothing. my prize story concerns a prominent
    athlete who was asked in a television interview where he was born. he replied,
    "well, i was basically born in new york." need i say more? another pet peeve of
    mine is the incorrect use of the pronoun "myself." there are several rules that
    apply, but the simple one is, never use "myself" when the pronouns "i" or "me"
    can be used instead. jean in mason city, ia.'

    have started to ask us when we are going to buy a house. (we save all year to

    i read your column about male nurses and, having been one for the last 13 years,
    i must comment. did you know that male nursing dates back to 1190 when the teutonic
    knights were founded to care for the wounded during the crusades? also, during
    biblical times, the knights of st. lazarus were founded to tend the lepers. i
    have had to face a great deal of prejudice while practicing my chosen profession.
    (no, i didn''t ever want to be a doctor. and yes, i care for female patients just
    as a female nurse would.) i feel that i am rendering a humanitarian service regardless
    of whether the patient is man or woman, rich or poor, black, white or yellow.
    my wife, who also is a registered nurse, has been very supportive. i realize that
    i am not alone and must do my part to bring the male nurse to an equal footing.
    until recently, the armed forces did not grant equal rank or pay to male registered
    nurses although our training was identical. (female nurses enjoyed officer status
    automatically. male nurses did not.) so here i stand, heterosexual and proud to
    be a nurse and a man. physicians, god bless them, spend a relatively short period
    of time with their patients, but nurses are there around the clock, faithful advocates
    of the patients'' rights and needs. thank you for an opportunity to air my thoughts.

    i can''t believe the prejudice of some women toward male nurses. women are fighting
    for equal rights and want to be accepted in a man''s world, but they don''t want
    men in theirs. how about equality for men? i am a young woman, but i am personally
    more comfortable with a male doctor than a female doctor. who knows? the female
    doctor could be a lesbian, right? and as for "lois," who said, "child molesters,
    perverts, wife-beaters, etc. were men"--women can also be child molesters, perverts,

    attack. grossly overweight, mrs. doe never took care of herself. survivors include
    her husband, joe "fatso" doe. died: timothy doe, of a drug overdose, a mixture
    of heroin and chemical drain cleaner. survivors include his parents, who take

    our daughter was recently married in a traditional protestant church wedding.
    her mother and i sat in the front pew on the left, and the groom''s parents occupied
    the front pew on the right. we arranged to have a friend videotape the entire
    ceremony from an obscure position behind the minister. after the honeymoon, the
    bride and groom and both sets of parents viewed the tape of the ceremony. it was
    beautiful. we were able to see the faces of the bride and groom as they pledged
    their vows--not just the backs of their heads, which is the view we (and everyone
    else) had during the ceremony. wouldn''t it make more sense--and a more beautiful
    ceremony--if the bride and groom were to face the congregation during the ceremony?
    this might not go over so well with some ministers, but i''m sure the congregation
    would appreciate it. what do you think? san diego parents'

    thanks to your column in the fresno bee, i became aware that you were able to
    help an american soldier return the identification papers taken from the body
    of a dead german soldier during world war ii. perhaps you can solve a similar
    dilemma of 41 years'' standing. i would like to return a sterling silver id bracelet
    to the family of a young sailor whose body my husband helped to prepare for burial
    at naval base hospital no. 18 on guam in 1944. the bracelet was engraved "michael
    hudzy (and his serial number) 33773514." sometime later, my husband was horrified
    to find this id bracelet in his jumper pocket where he must have dropped it in
    order to free his hands for other things. he was afraid to turn it in for fear
    of being accused of theft, as he truly didn''t remember putting it into his pocket.
    he kept it all these years hoping that somehow, someday he could return it to
    the boy''s family. through the years i have written to the veterans administration
    and the department of records in washington, asking for the boy''s address through
    a gi insurance policy--anything--but my letters were never answered. not long
    before my husband''s death in 1978, he mentioned again his desire to return this
    bracelet, feeling it must mean something to someone, somewhere. i still have it.
    can you help me return it to the family of michael hudzy? i''m signing my name
    and address. please contact me if you hear from his family and i will send it
    to them. mrs. j.p.w., fresno, calif.'

    i honestly don''t know how many denture-wearers there are in this country, but
    i would guess that about 10 to 15 percent of the population wears dentures. i
    know that all dentures should fit perfectly, but i''ll wager that millions do
    not. now, when that ever-present sesame seed creeps under a denture while the
    victim is eating in a fast-food place, the poor sucker has to interrupt his meal,
    go straight to the washroom, remove his denture and get rid of the seed. if he
    doesn''t, it feels like he''s chewing on a sewing needle! why sesame seeds in
    the first place? they have no taste and are an absolute nuisance. solution: order
    two burger bun bottoms? the two fast-food places in my town (mcdonald''s and burger

    a friend gave me these definitions of the various forms of government, and i thought

    the government takes both of them and gives you part of the milk. socialism: you
    have two cows. the government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. fascism:
    you have two cows. the government takes both cows and sells you the milk. nazism:
    you have two cows. the government takes both of them and shoots you. bureaucracy:
    you have two cows. the government takes both of them, shoots one, milks the other,

    will you please, please discourage high school and college graduates from sending
    graduation invitations to every distant relative they and their parents ever heard
    of? we all know that sending "invitations" to people we hardly know is a flagrant,
    shameless bid for a gift. and if, in a moment of weakness, one does send a gift,
    a barrage of birth announcements and invitations to weddings, showers and more
    graduations is sure to follow. i am a 75-year-old widow, living on social security
    and very little else. i just received a high school graduation invitation from
    the granddaughter of a third cousin whom i have not seen in so long i wouldn''t
    even recognize her. (i have never even met her granddaughter.) i have many relatives
    in this town, but i never hear from them unless they are celebrating something
    that requires a gift. i have no car, yet they "invite" me to every imaginable
    event, knowing full well i can''t possibly attend. this is just shameless begging.
    i am not cheap. i just sent a generous graduation gift to a neighbor girl who
    used to stop by every day to bring in my mail and newspaper and ask if i needed
    any errands run. don''t suggest that i send "a nice card" to the relatives who
    send me invitations to events they know i can''t attend. we both know a card is

    he just leaves me standing there. once he tried to pass me off as a "cousin."

    you will probably not print what i have to say, but at least i will get this off

    twenty-five years ago we lived across the street from a prominent attorney (a
    widower) who died suddenly. his relatives were cleaning out his home and they
    gave my husband a drawer filled with socks--old and new. he was told, "take what
    you want and toss the rest." as he was sorting through them, he found $2,000 in
    bills stashed in the socks. we immediately contacted the executor and returned
    the money. and would you believe, the deceased''s only child (a married daughter,
    living in another state) never as much as said "thank you." more surprising, nearly
    everyone we told said, "you should have kept the money. it was yours." what do

    OF THE DEEP FROM A SENIOR AQUARIST AT SHEDD AQUARIUM'
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    it''s 10 a.m. and the crowd hasn''t arrived yet at the john g. shedd aquarium
    on south lake shore drive. ralph bodamer, 65, is perched on a leather-covered
    bench in the main lobby, where figures of sea creatures curl up the walls like
    the smoke curling off the end of his cigarette. he''s on his morning break. the
    22-year shedd veteran has been on the job as senior aquarist since 8 a.m., cleaning
    tanks, checking water temperatures, feeding the hungry--in short, all the things
    needed to maintain the 600 animals in the freshwater tributaries exhibit that
    is his charge. bodamer, who recently returned from a collecting trip off the florida
    coast, will return that night to his bachelor apartment on the city''s south side
    to do more of the same for his own tank of south american discus fish. but first,
    he''ll share with freelance writer mary c. wagner some observations on life in
    the nation''s largest inland aquarium, and the curious behavior of species on
    both sides of the glass. most people who come to the aquarium miss a lot. we get
    a lot of school groups, and some of the kids take their chief delight in pounding
    on the glass to make the fish jump. people may ignore a fish unless it''s bizarrely
    shaped or fabulously colored. but there''s a lot to see if you know what to look
    for. one morning i looked into a tank of freshwater needlefish and saw what looked
    like pearls scattered all over the place. the fish were spawning, and the eggs
    were suspended by filaments from the plants, hanging there like pearl necklaces.
    visitors will stop at the tank of neon tetras because their electric red and blue
    is so striking. shedd had the first display of them in the united states after
    they were discovered in south america about 50 years ago. our director at the
    time obtained them from someone in germany, and 10 of the fish were flown over
    in a zeppelin. only one survived; they called it lonely lindy in honor of its
    trans-atlantic flight. the mouth breeders are another interesting thing to watch.
    they incubate their eggs in their mouths, and when the fry hatch, the parents
    are very protective of them. at the first sign of danger, the fry all turn around
    and crowd back into the mother''s mouth. they''re so tiny they look like a moving
    cloud of dust. everybody who visits the aquarium wants to see the piranhas. they
    want to see their teeth, and they''re disappointed when they can''t because the
    teeth are covered by the heavy skin of the lower jaw, like a bulldog. they''re
    talked about as being fierce, but i think those stories are exaggerated. i''ve
    heard of natives wading right into the stream with piranhas, and if they don''t
    bother the fish, they''re not attacked. sometimes i put on boots and get into
    the tank with them. i can read people''s lips from there, and someone will always
    say, "what kind of fish is that?" and laugh uproariously. he thinks he''s being
    very original. i''ve heard that line a million times. i started out in this field
    as a hobbyist, and my job is really an extension of my hobby. i was born on the
    south side. my dad used to raise laboratory animals for the university of chicago.
    i''ve always been an animal person, but i didn''t get interested in fish until
    my sister got a tropical aquarium. so i went to work in a tropical fish store.
    a fellow i knew from there was leaving a job at shedd, and he recommended me as
    his replacement. i came on as aquarist and i''ve been here ever since. i dropped
    out of high school, though i did finish a high school equivalency course after
    i got out of the service. but you''d probably have to have a degree in biology
    or marine biology to get my job today. aquarists hired now also are required to
    be trained, certified divers because we have divers go into the main reef tank
    twice a day--three times on the weekends--to feed the fish and put on a show for
    the visitors. i never did any diving myself because i have a punctured ear drum.
    what the public sees and what it takes to run this place are two different stories.
    we start at 8 in the morning. not all of the fish get fed every day, but we feed
    all of them monday and thursday--dry flake fish food, frozen herring, smelt, squid,
    krill, shrimp, worms. we grind or cut it down to different sizes and we may add
    trout pellets or alfalfa. we prepare the food in the morning and give it to them
    in the afternoon. on feeding days, i try not to work too much in the tanks--the
    fish regurgitate if they''re disturbed. i get into the tanks mostly to clean them,
    which we do by siphoning off dead and waste materials. we also get in to remove
    fish to other receptacles for treatment. sick fish frequently get their medicine
    in the form of a medicated bath, like a dog gets flea-dipped. taking care of tropical
    fish is much like taking care of children --they''re completely dependent on you,
    only they can''t tell you what is wrong with them. i look for signs of illness
    every day--frayed fins, fish shimmying sideways, or ich--a common parasite that
    shows up as tiny, white spots. i set up my own tanks, based on books or pictures
    of the native habitat. in designing the tank, i have two things to consider: visibility
    for the public and the welfare of the fish. if it''s not right, the fish may decide
    it doesn''t like its surroundings and burrow in the sand or hide where it can''t
    be seen. my job is concerned with fish as live animals, but i enjoy fishing on
    my time off. i find it relaxing to be out on the water. besides, fishing is like
    hunting--if some fish weren''t harvested, all fish would soon be out of food,
    and they''d die. i remember one time on a fishing trip when a fish broke loose
    from a line and 10 minutes later someone else caught it, still with a brand- new
    hook in its mouth, because it was still hanging around the boat. so maybe they
    don''t feel pain, or if they do, at least they don''t associate it with the food
    they''re eating as bait. after watching fish all these years, it''s clear to me
    that every creature is an individual--i don''t care if it''s a bumble bee. if
    individuality in a small fish is hard to discern, you just have to sit down and
    study it. i once had a dwarf gourami in a community tank, a species normally noted
    for its shyness. it was only about an inch long but it was the boss fish in the
    tank. any other fish that would come up to it would get nipped and driven away.
    we have half an hour every day when we take calls about fish. people can call
    between 4 and 4:30 p.m. monday through friday and on wednesday between 1:30 and
    2 p.m., using the aquarium''s main number. we get calls from all over the country.
    sometimes it''s kids trying to get us to do their homework, but we always pick
    them out and send them back to the encyclopedia. mostly it''s hobbyists. you''d
    be surprised at how attached people get to their fish. one woman sent us a box
    of candy at christmas--from her fish. one of my coworkers had a woman call in
    tears over a goldfish she''d had for seven years that had taken ill. once someone
    called from dear abby to ask if it was true that lobsters scream when they''re
    dropped into a pot of boiling water. the boiling water may bounce them around
    a bit so you''d hear their claws click, but the other sounds would be produced
    by air escaping from their shells--sort of a whistling teakettle effect. i''ve
    met hundreds of so-called experts over the years, but i don''t consider myself
    one. the day i think i know it all, i hope i have the sense to get out of this
    business. what''s the value of an aquarium? we have animals that people might
    not ever see otherwise--moray eels, sharks and deep-sea creatures. and i think
    that what we''re striving to do in terms of research, study and reproduction is
    important. they say seven-tenths of the earth is covered with water. shouldn''t
    we be interested in what''s going on in seven-tenths of the world? caption: photo:

    so much of your space has been devoted to the smokers versus nonsmokers controversy,
    how about equal time for those of us who don''t drink and are appalled at the
    number of fatalities resulting from drunk drivers? it is the height of hypocrisy
    for a person to complain that my smoking is a threat to his health, then go forth
    in a less than sober condition to become a potential highway murderer. my damage
    to another''s health by secondhand smoke is a questionably valid theory. a drunk
    behind the wheel of a car is an unquestionably greater hazard to greater numbers.
    it is interesting that so many of the activists in the "damn-the- smokers" crusade
    have kicked the habit and now are determined to frustrate my enjoyment. i can
    assure you that as a recovered alcoholic i have no inclination to deny the pleasures
    of socially acceptable levels of drinking to others. i believe that i have a right
    to equal treatment from nonsmokers. please give us smokers a break and print this.

  subject: GETTING THE FACTS STRAIGHT ON AIDS
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'dear readers: if you have no interest in aids, what it is, how people get
    it, how widespread it is, and how to protect yourself from becoming a victim,
    skip this column. in an effort to get the facts, i consulted dr. michael gottlieb,
    the eminent ucla immunologist who discovered the aids syndrome in 1981. the information
    in this column was confirmed by an information officer at the federal centers
    for disease control in atlanta. what is aids? it is the name for acquired immune
    deficiency syndrome, a virus that attacks and destroys the immune system, leaving
    its victims vulnerable to infections and numerous diseases, including types of
    cancer. how widespread is aids? the epidemic is almost worldwide. since 1981,
    more than 12,000 cases have been diagnosed in the united states alone, in which
    nearly half the victims have died. it is epidemic in central africa and haiti,
    and has also spread to europe and australia. it is estimated that 500,000 to 1
    million people already have been exposed to the virus. all individuals exposed
    do not necessarily succumb to aids, but they do have an increased risk of developing
    it. there can be an incubation period of several years between exposure to the
    virus and the development of aids, but the exact period of time is not known.
    how is aids transmitted? the most significant route is by anal sex, oral sex and
    "old-fashioned" sexual intercourse with a person who has been infected by the
    aids virus. although most cases have occurred among homosexual or bisexual men
    who have had multiple partners, aids is not exclusively a homosexual disease.
    an increasing number of cases are being found among heterosexual (straight) men
    and women. all sexually active men and women, gay or straight, should be concerned.
    the virus is also spread by shared contaminated needles among drug abusers, and
    through blood products given to hemophiliacs and other recipients of blood. some
    good news: transmission through blood is expected to decrease since the screening
    of blood donors to detect the aids virus began in early 1985. how aids is not
    spread: there is absolutely no evidence that aids is spread by casual contact
    with infected individuals. it cannot be spread by sharing towels, food or eating
    utensils with a person who has aids. neither can it be spread by touching, hugging
    or body contact other than sexual intimacy. what can be done about aids? a massive
    national program of public education as well as continuing research for a vaccine
    is now under way. people should avoid sex with multiple partners. they also should
    avoid contact with semen. (condoms, for example, may offer some protection.) it
    is important for all of us in the human family to show compassion and understanding
    to the victims of aids. they should not be avoided or ignored. i repeat, aids
    cannot be "caught" by touching or contact other than sexual. and although about
    70 percent of aids victims are homosexual men, it is not strictly a homosexual
    disease. aids victims should be visited by their friends and relatives. there
    is no danger to anyone who visits or cares for a person who has aids. i repeat,
    aids is transmitted by sexual interaction with a person who has it. hugging, caressing,
    holding, shaking hands with or being in close contact with a victim will not put
    one at risk of being contaminated. don''t assume that every person who has aids
    is sexually promiscuous. one contact (even years ago) with someone who had it
    is sufficient to infect a person. a wife can get it innocently from a bisexual
    husband who had been infected years ago by an aids victim. how can one obtain
    more information about aids? a national hotline with an informative recording
    can be reached by calling (800) 342-aids. many cities have a local aids information
    hotline. your telephone operator can advise you. now, you know as much about aids
    as i. and if you know someone who can use this information, please pass it along.'

    i have been married for nearly three years to a very beautiful 23-year-old woman.
    i am 30. our marriage hasn''t been perfect, but i considered it better than average,
    with one exception: "betty" has no interest in sex. once every two or three months
    is enough for her; then she acts like she''s doing me a favor. when i try to discuss
    it with her, she gets angry. despite our differences, i have given her all my
    devotion and a very comfortable life with all the material things a woman could
    want, a lovely home, clothes, jewelry and a car of her own. two weeks ago i discovered
    that betty had been seeing a married man. i was shocked and hurt. when i confronted
    her, she admitted it, and told me she''d never been physically attracted to me;
    she married me because i had money and she wanted to get out of her parents''
    home. she says she "loves me," but not in a physical way. betty doesn''t want
    a divorce. she says she''s strongly attracted to the married man and will not
    give him up. she insists that she wants to save our marriage, but needs to see
    her lover twice a week. i find this totally absurd and unacceptable. is this marriage
    worth saving? --hurting husband'

    everybody writes to you to get something off their chest; well, now it''s my turn.
    does anyone realize how difficult it is for a woman with a child to get a date?
    once a man finds out a woman has a child, he assumes she wants to get married
    and stick him with a ready-made family, then boom! it''s all over! that''s not
    true. there are some women, like myself, who would just like to go out with a
    member of the opposite sex once in a while. if marriage is in the cards, then
    it will work out. if not, well, it was fun while it lasted. so where does a decent

    in the 73 years of my life, 48 of them spent with my wife who died three years
    ago, i have always had dogs--spaniels and poodles--that were bathed in the kitchen
    sink. also, whenever we had ice cream we left a little for the dogs, and they
    licked the dish clean. this last year i became acquainted with a pennsylvania
    dutch lady who was at my house and saw me give my dog a bath in the kitchen sink.
    then she witnessed the same dog clean out my ice cream dish. she was horrified
    and said only people of "slum caliber" did that. in my neck of the woods, neither
    of these two practices was thought to be so terrible. i''ve been a farmer most
    of my life, and i''ve never found anything that wouldn''t wash off. do you think
    i should stop giving my dog a bath in the kitchen sink and refrain from letting

    for five years my husband and i tried to have a baby, but i couldn''t get pregnant;

    call him bob) come in and have his sperm tested, and if it was normal he could
    donate some sperm to be mixed with my husband''s, and i could be artificially
    inseminated with the combination. bob agreed to the plan, and he had his sperm
    tested. it was normal, and we were in seventh heaven. well, the day before i was
    to be inseminated, bob backed out. it seems he told his live-in girlfriend, and

    six months after dr. michael salesin became the first person on his block with
    a videocassette recorder, he realized it was obsolete. it had been the top of
    the line when he brought it home several years ago, a one-speed model with remote
    control. but the films that hollywood began releasing to the home video rental
    market were taped at a different speed, and suddenly salesin''s vcr was an electronic
    dinosaur. so he bought himself a second-generation vcr with three speeds. "to
    be the first on your block, you almost guarantee that whatever you buy will soon
    be obsolete and you''ll have to upgrade your equipment," said salesin, a gynecologist
    in suburban detroit. "it''s a definite dilemma: do you wait and buy when technology
    gets sophisticated, or do you buy early and enjoy it?" it is a dilemma consumers
    have faced ever since thomas a. edison''s original wax cylinders and hornlike
    speakers were replaced by vinyl disks, woofers and tweeters. with its promise
    of better performance, technology has long been to the home electronics industry
    what hemlines are to seventh avenue''s fashion designers, something that marks
    whatever came before as outdated. "innovation is part of this business," said
    allan schlosser, a spokesman for the electronic industries association, a washington-based
    group representing manufacturers. "but i don''t think we have revolutionary new
    products every six months. more often, what comes along are refinements that offer
    a sharper picture or better sound." the quickening pace of technical change is
    creating new questions for consumers who decide to replace their old equipment.
    is it worth it to buy compact disks, which cost $4 to $10 more than the same album
    in a conventional lp version? should you discard your turntable altogether when
    you buy a compact disk player? what can you do with a 10-year-old television when
    you buy a new one with stereo sound that plugs into your audio component system?
    these are questions that raise unpleasant memories for those who remember the
    clumsy reel-to-reel tapes that predated cassettes or the scratchy 78 rpm records
    that gave way to better quality 45s and long-playing 33s. there is the video disk,
    which rca abandoned after losing millions of dollars, although pioneer is proceeding
    with it. the first vcrs cost as much as $1,500 and were soon replaced by models
    that cost half that much and offered more features such as wireless remote controls,
    freeze-frame and fast forward and reverse scanning. now video components are becoming
    smaller and more compatible with home decor. and consumers are buying more and
    more equipment. television sales rose from 15.28 million in 1974 to 22.39 million
    in 1984, and although sales of color sets doubled during that period, last year
    was the worst year for black- and-white sets, only 5.2 million were sold, down
    from 6.8 million in 1974. most of the black-and-white sets sold last year were
    portables. but a lot of vintage black-and-white sets and other older equipment
    still are being used. the electronics association says that half the color television
    sets made in 1970 are still in use, as are 4 of every 5 made 10 years ago. "it''s
    obvious that people don''t toss away a set that still works," schlosser said.
    "but that doesn''t prevent them from buying new technology so they can have state-of-the-art
    equipment. people move them to the guest room, the den or someplace." to deal
    with new technology, consumers adopt several strategies. some people trade in
    their equipment for new components, although not all dealers take trade-ins. salesin''s
    early betamax sits on a shelf in his basement. gary miller, a detroit video enthusiast,
    said: "it depends. if it''s still in really good shape, i give it to my son. it
    it''s not, it''s relegated to a shelf in the basement or we give it to charity."
    for many who upgrade their equipment, the problem is not what to do with the old
    equipment but what to do with the old records. they wonder whether their favorite
    vintage performances will ever be available on compact disks. sally browne, the
    electronic association''s director of consumer affairs, bought new stereo components
    last year, replacing a 16-year-old system. she has a collection of frank sinatra
    records, some of which are 78s. her new turntable plays only 45s and 33s, and
    she is thinking about adding a compact disk player. "i''ll never get jackie gleason
    or bobby hackett on a compact disk," she said, "but i can copy the 78s onto cassette
    tapes. i think it''s great that i''m not stuck with just records but can choose
    from this variety of sources." but abby kenigsberg of syosset, n.y., took a different
    approach. she unplugged her turntable and carried it to the basement, along with
    several hundred records. "it had dawned on me that we didn''t have room on the
    shelf for our 78s and 33s anymore," kenigsberg said. "my husband loves music and
    some of those albums are dear old friends, but i said turntables are passe. we
    hadn''t listened to a record in four years, and i wanted to get our cassette tape
    collection into some kind of order." kenigsberg said she will not discard her
    lps, and alan baker, a lawyer who has a compact disk player, plans to hang on
    to his old albums, too. "i thought toscanini''s ''new world'' symphony on the
    compact disk was better than the original," he said. "the cds get the old lps
    off the shelf and up into the attic. the compact disk never wears out, and the
    lp becomes a historic curiosity." but other audiophiles sell their old lps to
    second-hand record shops and put the money toward compact disks. they say the
    economics is discouraging. used-record stores typically pay a maximum of $5 for
    an lp, about a third of the price of a compact disk. "i''ve sold a lot more albums
    than i''ve bought, things i didn''t listen to anymore," said eric love, a clerk
    in a detroit record store. for some consumers, one new piece of equipment is enough
    to prompt a major upgrading of an older stereo system. when dennis l. miller,
    a satellite time broker in cleveland, decided to buy a compact disk player, he
    realized that it would be far better than the rest of his equipment. so he also
    bought new speakers and a new amplifier. "it''s like you''re starting off all
    over again," he said. "and disks? i don''t know how many performances i''ve got.
    i went out and bought the five beethoven piano concertos, probably my sixth or
    seventh set." but roy o. brady of brooklyn waits to buy new equipment until he
    is certain the next generation is already on the way. he says that if manufacturers
    are planning to make improved versions, what he buys will continue to be usable.
    "it''s the gadgetry that makes you feel it''s obsolete," brady said. "you buy
    a vcr that will last five years, but six months after you bring it home they come
    out with a wireless remote. the vcr is not functionally obsolete; it''s just obsolete
    in your mind."'

    the letter you published recently from a healthy man asking why he must die before
    donating one of his kidneys brings to mind my own recent experience. i am a relatively
    healthy middle-aged man who recently went through two emergency major surgical
    procedures. my organs, i assume, are in fine condition, and i would have been
    willing and happy to sign an organ donor certificate. although my life was in
    imminent danger, neither my surgeon, my family physician, nor anyone at the hospital
    made such a suggestion. during my recuperation, i saw a group of people on a television
    talk show who were anxiously awaiting kidney donors so their lives could be saved.
    why can''t the medical community be more cooperative to those organizations handling
    organ transplants so that in situations such as mine, the opportunity to gain
    healthy organs is not lost? anonymous attorney'

    my boyfriend and i lived together for four years and planned to be married, but

    in my job, i write many letters to people whose gender is unknown. in these cases,
    the proper form of address always presents a problem. understandably, "gentleman"
    or "dear sirs" is an affront to women in positions of authority, yet alternatives
    seem inadequate. "ladies and gentlemen" assumes the presence of both sexes, which
    very often is not the case. "greetings" sounds like a summons from the government.
    "sirs and/or madams" has almost a bawdy ring. we need a new word. may i suggest

    reading your column daily has taught me a lot about the brashness of some people,
    but nothing i had read prepared me for the following: a woman i''m not well acquainted
    with (we chat when we see each other at the grocery store, which is seldom) appeared
    at my door last may. i had buried my mother the previous day and was feeling very
    tired, so i was still in bed at noon. when i went to the door, this woman chided
    me for still being in my bathrobe. i explained the situation, thinking she would
    apologize for intruding and leave. instead, she went on to tell me in great detail
    about her own mother''s death, which had occurred years ago. then she thrust an
    invitation to her daughter''s high school graduation in my hand and left. (i didn''t
    even know this woman had a daughter.) it''s now september. yesterday my phone
    rang and the caller identified herself as so-and-so''s daughter. i had no idea
    who she was talking about until she explained that her mother had given me an
    invitation to her graduation. she said that since she had not received a graduation
    gift from me, she figured i had probably put money in an envelope and had forgotten
    to mail it. i told her as tactfully as i could that i had done neither. then she
    said, "that''s all right, just put some money in an envelope and i''ll come right
    over and get it because i''m going shopping today and wanted to buy a few things."
    i was so angry i told her i was in no position to give her any money, then i hung
    up. is there a classification for people like this? if so, what is it? also, how
    would you have handled the situation? flabbergasted.'

    anything. during the two and a half years i courted "barbara," i''ve called her
    parents mr. and mrs. jones (not their real names), but after the wedding, it didn''t
    seem right, so i asked them what they wanted me to call them, and they said, "call

    calling them mr. and mrs. jones because it shows respect, and i''ve never called
    them anything else. barbara has no trouble calling my parents "mom and dad," which

    i am sick and tired of hearing that alcoholism is an "illness." it isn''t; it''s
    a vice, a moral weakness and a lack of self- control. although chronic excessive
    drinking can cause a number of diseases, it is not in itself a disease. i wish
    someone who insists that alcoholism is a disease would tell me what virus, bacterium
    or other micro-organism causes it. or is it a genetic disorder, inherited at birth?
    obviously, to classify alcoholism as a disease portrays the drinker as a victim
    who is not responsible for the damage his drinking does to himself and others.
    granted, this is very kind, but it is an undeserved kindness, having no basis
    in fact. the fact is, everyone has a choice. he can either choose to drink or
    choose not to drink. and the person who chooses to drink more than he is able
    to handle is not an innocent victim of a disease. he is a selfish drunk of his

    "cliff" and i have been married for 23 years, and we''ve had what i consider a
    good marriage, but something bothers me. before we met, cliff was engaged to "ellen,"
    but he caught her with another man and broke off with her. soon after, we met,
    fell in love and were married. ellen is also married and lives in another state,
    and cliff has kept in touch with her all these years. he''s especially close to
    ellen''s son, who is being married next month. cliff plans to go to the wedding
    and says i am welcome to go with him, but i don''t really want to go. this has
    me so upset i can''t think straight. i''ve always wondered why cliff has taken
    such an interest in that boy. i''ve even wondered if the boy was his. i don''t
    know what to do. should i go with him or not? or should i try to stop him from
    going? afraid to dig deeper.'

    i hired a self-employed contractor to install a swimming pool in our back yard.
    he arrived on the job with two helpers. one was his son, who had brought along
    his child, about 3 or 4 years old. neither the contractor nor his son knew where
    the little boy was or what he was doing half the time, and they spent a lot of
    time looking for him. meanwhile, i was paying $40 an hour for services that i
    did not receive. i couldn''t even go shopping because i was asked not to lock
    up the house because the child needed access to the bathroom. a friend of mine
    had a similar experience. she called a plumber, who arrived with a small child.
    the child proceeded to take the house apart while the plumber was busy under her

    your advice to "ready to scream," whose good friend came to visit with two undisciplined

    apart.) i tried that years ago, and this is what happened: although toys and coloring
    books were attractive and plentiful, the kids still preferred to pester their

    open, asking for a drink of water--anything to get attention. eventually my problem

    our son recently returned from a bible camp sponsored by our local church, where
    this incident occurred: it was late evening when 25 to 35 kids, aged 13 and 14,
    were in the main dormitory with the lights out. suddenly a dozen or so men in
    camouflage uniforms burst into the dorm with lanterns. one was armed with a shotgun,
    another had a rifle. they said they were an anti-christian organization. no one
    was allowed to leave, and several children were shoved and cuffed to indicate
    that they meant business. at first some kids laughed, then they became terrified
    and began to cry. several children managed to slip out through a side door and
    duck into a school bus, where they hid under the seats. two girls were known to
    be held by the man who was carrying the rifle. two shots were fired, and some
    of the kids assumed the girls were dead. meanwhile, three other girls ran to a
    nearby cabin inhabited by some locals who became frightened and called the police.
    the police arrived and contacted the camp counselor, who, by the way, was a respected
    teacher and wrestling coach. he admitted it was a mock raid to show the kids what
    could happen to christian children in some non-christian countries! my wife still

    drive me where i want to go as far as you can, but if you have an accident, i

    a long-time friend, whom i love dearly, is due to come soon for her annual two-week
    visit. in the past, we have learned to live with each other''s idiosyncrasies
    in order to preserve our friendship, but something occurred on her last stay that
    i don''t think i can put up with again. i love cats, and wish i had a dozen, but
    i have only one, "whiskers," whom i adore. my friend (i''ll call her carolyn)
    hates cats. on her last visit, i saw her actually kick whiskers out of her way.
    after i had told her that whiskers was not allowed to go outside because coyotes
    had killed several small pets in my neighborhood, she deliberately left my back
    door wide open several times! i was so shocked by carolyn''s behavior, i couldn''t
    even confront her about it. i feel guilty letting her come again, because i really
    don''t want her here knowing she might abuse whiskers while my back is turned.
    worse yet, leave the door open. how should i handle this sticky problem? whiskers''

    my heart went out to that junior high school girl whose boyfriend kept pressuring
    her for sex. for some reason, guys who would never actually force themselves on
    girls see nothing wrong with begging, pleading or just sheer persistence to get
    a girl to change her mind. when i was 18, i gave in to such a person, even though
    i really didn''t think it was right. now i would tell a guy like that to get lost;
    but then i was young and "in love" and desperate to please him. i couldn''t bear
    the thought that he had experienced sex with other girls, and thought if i had
    sex with him it would stop him from having it with anyone else. (it didn''t.)
    he soon dropped me for another girl. so much unhappiness could have been avoided
    if i had stuck by my beliefs. i went on to marry a wonderful man and i don''t
    dwell on the past. i consider myself lucky not to have gotten pregnant during
    that brief encounter. i was young and foolish. please continue to tell young girls
    that virginity is precious and can be given only once. i''m sorry i wasted mine.

    stayed for 2 hours or 10, they say, "you''re leaving already? you just got here.
    you always have to rush off. come back when you have more time to visit." their

    a reader wrote that she was going to a shower for a friend who was expecting triplets.
    her question: "must i bring three presents, or is one gift acceptable?" your reply:
    "give three gifts--one for each baby; the cost of all three should amount to whatever
    you would have spent had your friend been expecting a single." triplets are three
    children born together; had they been singles born a year apart, they would have
    been entitled to separate "whole value" gifts. neither the parents nor the children
    should be shortchanged at this time. the issue of multiples and gift-giving is
    far-reaching. when twins attend a birthday party, mothers should send them with
    two gifts of value that they would like to see reciprocated. since parents of
    singles often spend in the manner that you suggest, multiples rarely receive a
    gift of similar value to what was given. in the reverse circumstances, when gifts
    are given to teachers, mothers of multiples should give the full amount per child
    because the teacher had the responsibility for two (or three) children. the per-child
    gift acknowledges that the teacher had two hands to hold and two noses to wipe.
    friends and relatives could help by understanding that the circumstances of the
    birth should not affect the value of the gift. each child should be treated as
    an individual. diane weiss, president, nassau county mothers of twins club'

    i''m writing to you because i don''t know where else to turn. i live in the mountains
    and have a nice home with extra space to put people up. here was the schedule
    for last summer: first my daughter and her husband came for 10 days. then my brother
    and his wife came for two weeks. when they left, my grandson and his wife came
    for a week. over the labor day weekend, my son and his wife came with their three
    children. i''m 72 years old and tire easily. as i write this, i am so exhausted
    i can hardly hold my head up. i never let on how weary i am. sometimes at the
    end of a day, i cry. i do all the cooking and cleaning myself because i don''t
    think it''s right to ask guests to help out. and they seldom offer. no one realizes
    how hard is it on me because i never complain. my family is already planning to
    come for thanksgiving and christmas. what should i do? dead tired in north carolina.'

    the lady in my life (i''ll call her wanda) is a 36-year-old widow with one child--a
    16-year-old son. i''ll call him buddy. he''s a good kid, but his mother has spoiled
    him rotten. he talks to his friends on the telephone for two and sometimes three
    hours consecutively. wanda has to interrupt his conversation in order to use the
    phone--then he rushes her to get off so he can resume his conversation. i have
    given up trying to call because her line is always busy. wanda sees nothing wrong
    with this. she says she "loves" him, and the telephone is sort of a substitute
    father, so who am i to argue with her? right now she''s doing buddy''s homework
    while he''s playing a record for someone over the phone. i think something is
    terribly wrong here. what do you think? wanda''s man.'

    i''m a 16-year-old girl. recently i went into the hospital for some minor surgery.
    when i got there, i was asked a lot of personal questions --routine things, such
    as, "do you smoke? do you drink? do you do any kind of drugs? are you on the pill?"
    most of the questions i would have truthfully answered no to, but my parents were
    in the room at the time, so i just said "no" to all those questions so as not
    to be grounded for the rest of my life. then i worried all the way up to the time
    of my operation, hoping i wouldn''t go into a coma or something from the drugs
    or whatever they used to "put me under." luckily, everything went well. can''t
    they ask you these questions in private? i can see how not being honest could
    cause a dangerous situation. i know this has been a problem with a lot of kids
    my age, including my brother. sign me . . . lied and scared.'

    ok. i asked, "how about weekends and holidays?" his reply was, "today is saturday

    days they work and which days they want to sleep, 8 a.m. is ok. well, my neighbor

    a question of ethics with regard to abortion: to whom is the family physician

    had made the decision to become sexually active. although she and i had talked
    about this from time to time, i didn''t want to make it appear that i condoned

    we live in an old-folks home in oregon. our ages range from 55 to 99 years old.
    we would like to know how women like us can find men to socialize with. men are
    scarce here, and we can''t get out to meet any. when we mention it to anyone on
    the staff, we''re told we are too old to think about things like that. i don''t
    think people ever get too old to desire companionship with the opposite sex, do
    you? don''t suggest that we look over the men in this home. there are three women

  body: 'dear readers: i have just read a wonderful book titled "alone after school"
    by helen swan and victoria houston. it''s a complete self-care guide for latchkey
    children and their parents. now that more than 60 percent of american mothers
    work outside the home and approximately 10 million children under 12 years old
    are coming home to an empty house, this book is a timely treasure. it tells children
    what to do about accidents--bumps, bruises, burns, cuts, nosebleeds, poisoning,
    electric shock, stomach aches, etc. it covers every imaginable emergency, including
    what to do if somebody tries to break in; it stresses the importance of having
    the phone numbers of police, firemen, paramedics, neighbors and the 911 emergency
    number taped on every telephone. it tells a child how (and how not) to answer
    the door and telephone. there are simple recipes for children, and guidelines
    for parents on how to set up rules to keep peace between siblings. a single chapter
    titled "is my child ready?" is well worth the price of the book. it contains a
    checklist for parents to test a child''s readiness to be left alone. (age is not
    always the determining factor.) "alone after school" should be in every home where
    children are left unsupervised, if for only a few hours occasionally. it''s available
    at your local bookstore for $8.95. it also can be ordered directly from the publisher
    by calling this toll-free number: 800-238-2333. or send a check or money order
    to prentice-hall, englewood cliffs, n.j. 07632 (add a dollar for postage). you''ll

    when i married sheldon (not his real name), we were very much in love, but he
    was a poor, struggling college student, and my parents never thought he would

    a little money, so my father thought i should have a prenuptial agreement--in

    just paid $120,000 in income taxes.) my problem is obvious. now i regret having

    lyena was angry at her doctor''s negligence. "alexander stone" was proud of his
    black-market profits. and one anonymous teenager, her blushing discernible right
    off the page of newsprint, related regrettable results of adolescent sex. open
    a soviet newspaper. turn to the letters page. in a society renowned for its concentration
    on conformity, the voices are remarkably distinct. journalists working for the
    official state media readily concede that the "letters to the editor" columns
    of this nation''s numerous newspapers and magazines remain a carefully controlled
    forum. if concerning the war in afghanistan, the letters are limited to such things
    as the boasting of a veteran''s proud mother. regarding the crackdown on alcoholism,
    the letters would lead one to judge this an entire nation on the wagon. on other,
    less political topics, the personalities come through, and a moment spent perusing
    these letters is a moment spent peering into the russian soul, an opening to common
    concerns of the modern soviet citizen. for in the soviet union, there is no "tonight
    show," no dear abby and no alderman who wants to be remembered at election time.
    so for those with an interesting tale to tell, a question too delicate for even
    the closest friend or a problem at the local market--write the editor. "why is
    it that at the very height of the season there are not enough fruit and vegetables
    on our tables?" asked a letter in trud, the labor newspaper. citizens in brest,
    arkhangelsk and ulan ude echoed these sentiments. said one: "when i go shopping
    for vegetables, i come back carrying only what i left with--an empty string bag."
    the editors dispatched 30 reporters in 30 cities with the assignment: go shopping.
    the editor candidly replied to his readers that "far from all had any success."
    there were no onions in tyumen, ivanovo, volgograd and novosibirsk. no greens
    were seen in gorky, kemerov, khabarovsk and ufa. the good news was in tomatoes,
    readily available in tashkent and alma ata. such honest self-critique is, at first,
    unexpected in the soviet press. but new kremlin chief mikhail gorbachev has legitimized
    criticism of official wastefulness, inefficiency and backwardness, and such letters
    fit neatly with his campaign to clear bureaucratic dead wood. "these changes did
    not date precisely back to his coming to power," said alexander greengauz, deputy
    editor of moskovskaya pravda, the newspaper of the moscow city communist party
    organization. his newspaper, which has a daily circulation of 600,000, receives
    300 letters a day, processed by 30 reporters aided by part-time "worker- correspondents."
    more than half the letters are redirected to boards or agencies. by law, the ministry
    or department must respond to the newspaper''s query within a set time, greengauz
    said. on a normal day, four or five letters from readers appear on page 2 of moskovskaya
    pravda, with editorial replies alongside. of concern to lyena, who wrote for a
    community young communist league newspaper, was an overworked and callous obstetrician.
    the pregnant moscow resident said she waited 40 minutes for the start of her prenatal
    care class when the doctor entered and said, "ladies, i''m up to my eyes in work,
    so i''ll stamp your forms showing you''ve listened to me and if any of you have
    any questions, come back on friday and perhaps i shall be able to have a chat."
    stunned, lyena said she thought to herself: "but what if you don''t have a stamp?
    are you not allowed to give birth?" an inside look at the economics of black marketeering
    was supplied by a man calling himself alexander stone, whose letter to the national
    edition of the young communist league paper was headlined, "happiness through
    blat"--a russian word that is a linguistic first cousin to "clout." "i help people,
    and people thank me for it," stone said in describing his 30 percent discounts
    on such things as watches, running shoes and hard-to- purchase audio equipment.
    as a black marketeer, his monthly salary may reach 800 rubles--$960. that is a
    magnificent raise from his previous 130-ruble-a-month factory job, supplemented
    by his wife''s 120-ruble-a-month wage. "many people, especially children of well-to-do
    parents, have everything from birth," stone wrote. "now i have everything, too."
    his letter drew a terse response from the editors, who wrote, "let your son write
    an essay in his exercise book on ''what my daddy does,'' on how you skulk around
    back entrances like a thief, begging for an extra fiver for your wares." the most
    touching letter published in recent weeks was from a young woman who wrote anonymously
    to meridian magazine with her tale of soiled love. "i tried to convince myself
    that i was in love," she said of her reaction to ceaseless pressure from a boyfriend
    eager for sex. she relented and became pregnant. the father did not even come
    to the maternity ward when she gave birth. caption: map: soviet union. illustration

    got drunk and urinated on a parked car. a policeman witnessed this, and our son
    was charged with indecent exposure, which is a felony. our son is now in his 30s,
    married with children, active in scouting and owns his own business. he is interested
    in moving to florida but is terrified of this incident hanging over his head.
    indecent exposure sounds as if he was exposing himself to people, but, he was
    just a college kid who drank too much and chose a handy place to relieve himself.
    i''m sure the police have arrested many kids in florida over easter break. my
    question: is there a way to erase this from his record? he and his family went
    to disney world, and he was afraid to drive for fear of an infraction of the law
    because of this happening years ago. you have my permission to run this in your
    column to warn other young people that what they do can follow them all through
    life. heartbroken.'

    if plans go according to schedule, i''ll be married next june. i met "julia" when
    i was a senior at college. she was a junior. after i graduated, i drove down to
    see her nearly every weekend. i live about two hours from there. we started to
    go steady, then i gave her an engagement ring. one night julia called me from
    college crying. she said she had fooled around with a guy i knew (i''ll call him
    john), but she promised she would never go near him again. she called me several
    times after that to say john was still "after her," but she didn''t want me to
    do anything about it because she could handle it. meanwhile, i was very upset
    after these calls. then one morning she called in tears to say that john had given
    her a ride somewhere, refused to take her home and tried to rape her, but she
    fought him off. i told her i was driving right down there to have it out with
    him, but she begged me not to, saying they have a lot of mutual friends and she
    didn''t want any awkward feelings. she asked me for her sake to forgive and forget.
    here''s the payoff: julia put john on her guest list for our wedding! i told her
    i couldn''t stand the sight of that guy and i didn''t want him anywhere near us
    on our wedding day. she says he''s a good friend to all her friends and she can''t
    leave him out. i am ready to tell julia if she wants to marry me, she can''t invite
    john. am i wrong? end of rope.'

    your answer to "often stuck" was all wet. she wanted to know how to avoid giving
    her phone number to a man in whom she wasn''t interested, and you told her to
    take his number instead and say she''ll call him when she has some free time.
    why is it so hard for women to say no? i have had women give me their phone number
    after i''ve asked for it only to find them surprised when i call, and then i get
    turned down. women have told me that they''re afraid of hurting a man''s feelings
    by refusing to give him their phone number. believe me, straightforward honesty

    i am a pastor who believes in a lot of home visitation, and when i go into a home
    i will inevitably find the boob tube blaring. after i''ve been seated for about
    three minutes, i ask pleasantly, "may i turn down the tv a wee bit?" usually they
    say, "oh, just shut it off!" if they hesitate, or say, "well, i will turn it down
    just a little bit," then this is a signal to me that they are more interested
    in their "soap" than their salvation, and in 15 minutes i am gone. and incidentally,
    i do not agree with you that people are not socially obligated to turn off the
    tv when someone drops in unexpectedly. after all, is a television program more

    i have just returned from another shopping trip frustrated and empty-handed. all
    i want is one good-looking dress that i can wear for an evening out. i would like
    to ask the american fashion designers: for whom are you designing? each other?
    certainly not for american women. i am a 41-year-old professional woman who has
    worked hard to maintain a trim figure, and i''d like to show it off a little.
    today''s designers make that hard; their fabrics are lovely but the styles range
    from frumpy to ridiculous. i can find nothing without a blousy waist (intended
    to hide at least 20 pounds around the middle), and dresses with shoulder pads
    that make me look like a football tackle. whatever happened to the classic little
    cocktail dress whose shape approximates a woman''s figure? i''m boycotting the
    dress market until the designers come up with something worth buying, and i''ll
    bet i have plenty of company. threadbare but resolute in virginia.'

    a year ago my beloved sister, "ida," passed away. it was a blessing, as she had
    been terminally ill for a long time. ida left a devoted husband, "al," age 57,
    a married daughter, "jill," and jill''s child, who is the apple of al''s eye.
    al started dating a young woman i''ll call bonnie. our family had known bonnie
    and her family for years. she''s divorced, childless and a very fine person. al
    and bonnie seem happy together. now the problem. jill disapproves of the relationship
    between her father and bonnie. she thinks bonnie is too young for her father.
    (she and jill are the same age, 36.) jill told her father that if he continues
    dating bonnie, she will not allow him to see his granddaughter. my sister was
    a loving, generous person, and she would not have wanted al to stop living because
    she died. al is a healthy, active man, and deserves some happiness after all he''s
    been through. we don''t want al to quit dating bonnie, which he would probably
    do rather than give up seeing his grandchild. how do you see this situation, and
    how do we help? wants to help.'

    my husband and i have a problem with his sister that requires your immediate attention.
    for years now "sis" has been sending newsy christmas letters to friends, relatives,
    old schoolmates and people we rarely see and hardly know. it wouldn''t be so bad
    if she would just write about her own husband and children, but she writes about
    the whole gang of us, including her in-laws, trips, what they''ve bought and where
    they plan to go, which boils down to bragging at its worst! she tells what is
    going on with all the members of the entire family, which includes us. my husband
    (her brother) has been in and out of court for several years with business problems
    and lawsuits, and she tells about our "never-ending problems in court" in every
    newsletter. nothing, including gossip and rumors, goes unmentioned. this includes
    separations, divorces, jilted lovers, you name it. to make matters worse, her
    husband has bought her a word processor for christmas, so her christmas letters
    can be longer now! how can we stop her? several other family members feel the
    same way, but are as helpless as we are. please get this in your column as soon
    as possible, abby. you will be doing this family an enormous favor. nervous in

    i am seeing a very wonderful man, and he has asked me to marry him. we seem so

    child he believes to be his own but has never seen! the child''s mother was 17
    and he was 18 when "suzie" was born. he said he had no desire to see suzie, but
    her mother is still hoping that one day he will marry her. he has not seen the
    mother, either, and has no desire to. this seems strange to me, abby. his daughter
    lives less than 100 miles from here. he insists that he is comfortable with this
    situation and prefers to keep things as they are. now i am wondering what kind
    of man would turn his back on his own daughter. this bothers me a lot. what are
