    last year, my mother gave me a lovely set of china. my husband and i shopped around
    and found a very handsome china closet in which to display it. a few days ago,
    my mother came to visit us, and while admiring the china closet and its contents,
    she said, "i expect you to leave the china i gave you to ramona." (ramona is my
    niece.) i was rather surprised and somewhat disturbed to hear this, because i
    had planned to leave the china and cabinet to my daughter and son-in-law. i should
    have said something, but i didn''t. my question: am i obligated to leave the china
    to ramona? confused in georgia'

    a computer twist. my husband spends a lot of time on his home computer. he belongs
    to some services on the computer using the telephone. he has spent more than $2,000

    our consumer center has produced a book titled "why women pay more." the first
    of its kind, the report demonstrates how women are cheated and harmed in the marketplace
    because they are women, and shows women how they can avoid these marketplace perils.
    covering topics that range from clothing to medical care, auto to home repair,
    pensions and insurance, lawyers to advertising, "why women pay more" blows the
    whistle on gender gouging while providing useful advice on how to avoid these
    abuses and how to report them to authorities. we want women to stop the billions
    of dollars of deceptive promotions, poor-quality merchandise, unnecessary surgery,
    drugs and car/home repairs from being handed over to unscrupulous merchants. the
    result would be greater health, efficiency and peace of mind. can you help bring
    this book to the attention of your readers? (men need to know about these things,
    too.) the introduction and preface by me and the author, frances cerra whittelsey,
    summarize the situation - one too long ignored by consumer agencies, women''s
    groups and business schools. it is truly an outrage - and something can be done
    about it. thank you for your interest. ralph nader, washington, d.c.'

    on easter sunday, i wore a new hat with a medium-sized brim. midway through the
    service, the minister requested that we all "squeeze in" a little closer together

    on the shoulder. it was an usher who asked, "would you mind removing your hat?"
    i replied, "yes, i would mind." then i started to feel a little guilty and tried
    to get back into the spirit of worshiping. i could no longer see the minister
    because of the new position of the people in front of me. (should i have asked
    them to remove their heads?) at the service''s conclusion, the woman seated directly
    behind me planted herself in the middle of the aisle and announced that i had
    ruined her easter because she couldn''t see the minister. i told her that everyone''s

    can you stand one more letter about funny last names? there''s a running joke
    about mine. thirteen years ago, i married a man whose last name was fuerst - pronounced
    "first." ironically, i''m the second mrs. fuerst. in the early years of our marriage,
    my husband and i discussed possible names for our children - hugo fuerst for a
    boy and april fuerst for a girl. when filling out applications, or opening accounts,
    i''d be asked, "what is your name? please give me your last name first." i''d
    reply: fuerst. i''d be corrected, "not your first name - your last name; i need
    your last name first." i''d repeat, fuerst, only to be corrected again, until
    i''d say, exasperatedly, "fuerst is my last name." "first is your last name? how
    is that spelled?" i''d begin, "f-u" . . . appearing to be making some kind of
    obscene remark until i''d say "e" followed by "r-s-t," which satisfies the inquirer.
    however, abby, my name does have one advantage. when people are all cued up, waiting
    to be called, and we hear, "who''s first?" i reply cheerfully, and honestly, "i

    to me. your flag hello. remember me? some people call me old glory, others call
    me the star-spangled banner, but whatever they call me, i am your flag, the flag
    of the united states of america. something has been bothering me, so i thought
    i might talk it over with you-because it is about you and me. i remember some
    time ago, people would line up on both sides of the street to watch the parade,
    and naturally i was leading every one, proudly waving in the breeze. when your
    daddy saw me coming, he immediately removed his hat and placed it against his
    left shoulder so that his hand was directly over his heart-remember? and you,
    i remember, were standing there, straight as a soldier. you didn''t have a hat,
    but you were giving the right salute. remember your little sister? not to be outdone,
    she was saluting the same as you, with her right hand over her heart-remember?
    what happened? i''m still the same old flag. oh, i''ve added a few more stars
    since you were a boy, and a lot more blood has been shed since those parades of
    long ago. but now, somehow, i don''t feel as proud as i used to feel. when i come
    down your street, you just stand there with your hands in your pockets. you may
    give me a small glance, and then you look away. i see children running around
    you shouting; they don''t seem to know who i am. i saw one man take his hat off,
    then he looked around, and when he didn''t see anybody else take off his hat,
    he quickly put his on again. is it a sin to be patriotic today? have you forgotten
    what i stand for, and where i have been? anzio, guadalcanal, korea and vietnam!
    take a look at the memorial honor rolls, and see the names of those patriotic
    americans who gave their lives to keep this republic free. when you salute me,
    you are actually saluting them. well, it won''t be long until i''ll be coming
    down your street again. so when you see me, please stand straight and place your
    hand over your heart, and i''ll know that you remembered. i''ll salute you by

    a girl pregnant and had to rush her to an abortion clinic. that''s not all. next,
    george got 90 days in the county jail for shooting a gun at his girlfriend. (he
    missed her.) when i visited george in jail, he broke down and told me everything.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    after reading the letter about the two grown men (cousins) who got the giggles
    during the funeral service of their uncle, i had to write and tell you what happened
    at my grammy''s funeral. the minister told everyone to stand for the eulogy and
    prayer, and that''s when the giggling and snickering began. soon, the minister
    was giggling and snickering along with the rest of the mourners. guess what started
    it all? it seems that when grampy stood up, his pants fell to his ankles, and
    he was so deep in prayer he didn''t bother to pull up his pants until after the
    eulogy. that funny episode broke the tension and made grammy''s death a little
    less painful. so, as the saying goes, "laughter is the best medicine." b.m. reinhardt,

    i''d like to comment on the divorced father who sent his 6-year-old daughter a
    dozen long-stemmed roses for valentine''s day and his girlfriend of three years,
    a dozen short-stemmed roses! (he lamely blamed it on "a friend" who ordered them
    for him.) first, how about something more practical and lasting for a 6-year-old
    - such as time, shared values, or a memorable trip to the zoo? second, don''t
    discount the girlfriend''s feelings. feelings aren''t right or wrong. she has
    a right to have hers. to the girlfriend: things probably won''t change with your
    boyfriend, unless they get worse. men do lots of stupid things regarding children
    from former marriages to assuage their guilt. evaluate carefully before making
    any long-term plans with this one! i''ve been there twice, and the only thing

    let me assure you that the question of indulging and overcompensating children
    after divorce will be a critically important factor in the next marriage - where
    emotional power struggles are bound to occur. a dozen long-stemmed roses for a
    6-year-old? a totally unnecessary gesture, which is a thoughtless put-down to
    the girlfriend and a subtle message that empowers a 6-year-old. "jealous valentine"
    is wise to bring this touchy issue and her feelings out into the open. she needs
    to know what her boyfriend''s priorities are going to be, in order to have a healthy,
    well-balanced marriage - especially where stepchildren are involved. my experience
    over 20 years has proved that the husband/wife relationship needs to be top priority,
    and the children need to know this! if a stepparent is willing to be a totally
    self-sacrificing partner, let the children be indulged to the hilt - but if you
    want and need more from a marriage, either speak up, or beware! delaware stepmother'

    not so long ago, you had something in your column about the definition of "rsvp."
    you stated you were sure many people didn''t know what it meant. well, until recently,
    i did not know what "sase" meant. i''m a high school graduate, but somehow that
    term had never been explained to me in school, and when i saw it in print, i sort
    of skipped over it because i didn''t understand it. recently i was complaining
    to my aunt about some company not responding to a letter i had sent, and auntie
    asked me, "well, did you send an sase with your letter?" i told her i did not
    know what she was talking about. then she explained to me that people will reply
    if you send a "self-addressed, stamped envelope" or "sase" with your letter. bingo!
    i finally caught on to what the initials meant. believe me, the next time i need
    to hear from someone i will be sure to include that envelope. i''m sharing this
    because there are probably others who do not know what those initials mean, and
    wonder why they didn''t get the information they requested. you have my permission

    this is for "brokenhearted wife," whose husband took a female co-worker to a basketball

    of marriage, my husband decided to train for a 26-mile marathon race. he met a
    woman who was also training for this event. she was married with two children.
    everything appeared very aboveboard and proper. their running together continued

    think there was anything odd about my husband''s so-called platonic relationship
    with this woman. in my seventh month of pregnancy, my husband announced that he
    was leaving me. oh, by the way, his running partner left her husband at the same
    time. (surprise, surprise!) it is now three years later, and my husband is living
    with this woman i wasn''t supposed to be concerned about. meanwhile, he contends

    i''ve enjoyed the letters about inappropriate laughter at funerals. i will never
    forget my uncle john''s funeral. he was a retired military man who didn''t have
    many close friends-except those he met in bars and gambling casinos. as my parents
    walked into the chapel, followed by my siblings-all grown adults-a recording of
    "amazing grace" was playing. the record had a crack in it and the needle kept
    getting stuck. then the chaplain, who had never met uncle john, kept mispronouncing
    his last name, and everyone got the giggles. it was contagious-people were laughing
    so hard, they cried. after the funeral, my parents invited everyone to join us
    at the holiday inn next door for lunch. dad had his usual martini, mom had her
    manhattan, and we had wine with lunch. the waiter said: "you all seem so full
    of life today. what''s the happy occasion?" my mother said, "we just buried a

    it doesn''t matter if you''re 8 years old or 60. if you''re lucky enough to have
    a father, sit down and write him a letter. tell him how much he has meant to you
    over the years. don''t be shy about telling him how much you love him, and why.
    it doesn''t have to be a literary masterpiece - just a few sentences will do.
    of course, if you''re in a sentimental mood, go ahead and express those thoughts
    you may have found difficult to verbalize. then, sign the letter, be sure to add
    the date. long after the neckties, shirts, wallet and cologne are worn and discarded,
    i''ll bet your father''s day gift remains tucked away for safekeeping with his
    most important papers. how do i know? because mine was. love, abby'

    going about the daily routine in this ''90s "me" generation, i''ve observed that

    ''90s 1. be on time. this includes responding to rsvp invitations and canceling
    appointments you aren''t going to keep. 2. include your phone number when leaving
    a message on someone''s answering machine, in case he''s getting his messages
    from a car or pay phone. 3. ask: "may i have . . .?" instead of telling people,
    "i need . . ." 4. carry a pen or pencil so you don''t have to borrow one. 5. don''t
    call anyone''s home before 9 a.m. or after 8 p.m. unless it''s an emergency. 6.
    if you have call waiting, don''t make the person you were talking to first wait
    on "hold" if you get another call. 7. be quiet in libraries, in theaters after
    the movie starts, and in hotels and hallways after 8 p.m. and before 10 a.m. 8.
    "closed" means closed. 9. don''t violate people''s privacy by giving their name,
    address or phone number to salesmen or anyone else without each person''s prior
    permission. 10. you are responsibile for your children and their behavior. robert
    alan soltis, esq.'

    it''s been the practice in some doctors'' offices to address individuals by their
    first names. i''m in my 70s, and resent it when someone comes into the waiting
    room and calls, "richard!" whatever happened to mr., mrs. or ms.? i''ve discussed
    this with others in my age group, and the consensus is that they don''t like it
    either. when i asked about it in a doctor''s office, i was told, "we''re all on
    a first-name basis here." (that may have been the case, but the doctor was always
    called, "dr. so-and-so.") another nurse''s aide said that using the first name
    helped to avoid mistaken identity between patients in the waiting room. that explanation
    is just plain stupid. there would be a greater chance of finding another "richard"
    in the waiting room than a "mr. larson." recently, when i bought something with
    my credit card, the clerk handed me my receipt and said, "thank you, richard."
    i asked why "mr. larson" wasn''t good enough, and she replied, "the company policy
    requires us to personalize our comments." i asked to see the manager, who informed
    me that the employee was correct, and employees who did not do so would be subject

    a small plate off a wooden rack. it fell to the floor and broke into several pieces.
    a young woman rushed over and said, "you owe me $40 for that piece!" the gentleman
    looked shocked, but got out his wallet and started to count the few bills he had,
    when the woman with him said to "ms. manager," "you must be insured for this:
    the gentleman is living on his social security. also, $40 is outrageous for that
    plate; it wasn''t even marked." ms. manager ran to the telephone, saying, "i''m
    calling the police." the woman with the elderly gentleman led him from the store,
    and they were soon out of sight. my husband and i stayed for half an hour, and
    no police came. abby, how would you have handled this? curious traveler'

    what should i do with a husband who insists on keeping condoms? we do not use
    condoms, so i feel he has no need to keep them. when i discovered that he was
    keeping them in his drawer under his underwear, i confronted him and told him
    there was really no reason for him to keep them. he led me to believe that he
    would get rid of them, but i found that he only moved them. i figured out that
    the only reason a married man keeps condoms after his wife has had a hysterectomy
    is that he must be planning to use them with someone other than his wife. what
    do you think i should do about it? untrusting wife'

    than 35 years. marie passed away several years ago, and we have continued to see
    steve on a social basis as we always did, including him in family celebrations,
    having him to dinner, etc. over the past several years, i have cooked many meals
    for steve who, by the way, cannot cook. i''ve never expected anything but a simple
    thank-you, but suddenly it occurred to me that never once has steve brought over
    a bottle of wine, sent a plant for christmas or even a card for my birthday. on
    those occasions when my husband and steve and i go out for dinner, steve has never
    offered to pick up the check. he is quite well-off and could easily afford it.
    my question: do you think steve is just plain ignorant, cheap, or taking advantage
    of us? in our culture, many people seem to "forget" their friends who have lost
    their mates, but my husband and i are the only ones of our mutual friends who
    have continued to include steve as always. abby, do you think i have a right to

    after reading the letter from "embarrassed in boston," whose adult son and his

    my uncle joe passed away at the ripe old age of 92. he had been a member of the
    american legion, so at his funeral an elderly comrade stood off to the side of
    the casket and proceeded to play "taps" on a beat-up trumpet. he was pathetically
    out of tune, which struck me funny, so i buried my face in my hands to conceal
    my laughter. other family members, thinking i was taking my uncle''s death very
    hard, gathered around to console me. at another funeral, while the minister delivered
    the eulogy, i whispered to my husband, "doesn''t the minister remind you of bozo?"
    the minister''s head was bald in the middle with a lot of fluffy hair over each
    ear. it looked like someone had run a lawn mower clean up the middle of his head.
    i discreetly laughed hysterically into several wadded up tissues. many times,
    my younger brother charles and i would just look at each other at the dinner table
    and we''d break up. once during one of these giggling fits, our parents started
    to laugh. poor dad kept biting the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing,
    but it didn''t help. charles and i are both in our 40s now and our parents have
    passed away, but we still go on these contagious laughing jags. nostalgic in baltimore'

    in retirement, i am now hooked on talk shows. i enjoy the "make-overs," but they
    always use thin young women with thick hair, never older women with extra pounds
    and thinning hair. i subscribe to many magazines; they often have articles on
    looking good at 30, 40 and 50 - never 60, 70 and 80. yet the population is definitely
    living longer. women may now have 40 or 50 years to live after their children
    are raised. i have two sisters who are still vital at 83 and 84. ladies home journal
    has a monthly feature, "can this marriage be saved?" yet they report only on couples
    in their 20s and 30s! the latest weight watchers ad on tv in this area shows only
    young women. all young women will get old one day - if they are lucky. why are
    older women so invisible? mrs. bea zirk, 69, richland, wash.'

    too long or too short - and my clothes are either too loose or too tight. i have
    never talked back to her, but once when she was on my back about something, my
    husband told her to lay off and quit picking on me, so she said i was "overly
    sensitive." well, she is overly insensitive, and always has to have the last word.
    this irritates me. last sunday we were at my mother-in-law''s for supper, so after
    we ate, everyone went to the family room and it was obvious that they expected
    their daughter and me to clean up. when my mother-in-law comes to my house, i

    this is in response to the reader whose pet peeve is people who come to church
    services and plop themselves down at the end of the pew and expect everyone to
    crawl over them. i am very short, so i always get to church early so i can get
    an aisle seat. i am reminded of what happened to me when our son graduated from
    the air force academy. the graduating ceremony was to begin at 9 a.m., so we got
    to the stadium at 7 a.m. and stood in line until the gates opened at 8. i staked
    out an aisle seat and sat on that hard concrete for an hour. at exactly two minutes
    to 9, a pretty young thing trotted down the aisle on the arm of a cadet. he leaned
    down and asked me sweetly, "would you mind moving down, please?" i smiled back
    and replied, "young man, do you know how long i have been sitting here?" he looked
    surprised and ashamed, as he found a couple of seats in the middle of the row.

    i am writing in response to the letter from a mother whose daughter was adopted
    shortly after birth. you responded with a beautiful poem titled, "legacy of an
    adopted child." i can certainly relate to this poem, being the mother of two children,
    an 11-year-old son by birth, and an adopted 2-year-old daughter from korea. this
    column referred to the "natural" mother vs. "birth" mother, which brings me to
    my reason for writing. as an adoptive parent, i feel it is important to educate
    the public regarding the use of proper terms when speaking about adoption. i consider
    myself and my daughter to be very "natural" and "real." i have also been asked
    whether or not i have any children "of my own." my response is: "are you asking
    if i have any children by birth?" i do not wish to discourage these questions,
    and i am very sympathetic to the fact that most people simply do not know the
    proper terms to use, but i am concerned about how their questions sound to the
    adopted child. imagine how you and your child would feel if someone asked you
    point-blank: "do you know anything about her real mother?" thanks for helping
    me educate a few people. just call me "mom"'

    no children but mothered many?) now, "will the youngest mother present please

    gave up her child when she was 15?) now, "let''s see the mother who has had the
    most children!" (this will revive memories of all the ridicule and insults endured

    will send a message to people who engage in sinful behavior, and worse yet, take
    chances. when are people going to wake up and realize that there is no "safe sex"?

    you once wrote, "if you want your children to turn out well, spend half as much

    i watch my grandchildren grow pathetically spoiled. when i raised my children,
    i was home all day and my husband provided for all of us. our children had nice
    toys, good clothing, and we all took family vacations together. now i see my grandchildren
    wearing designer clothes, with more toys than will fit into one room. their parents
    take them on weekend trips to texas, louisiana, alabama and florida. the cost
    is outrageous. meanwhile, my children are in debt up to their eyeballs trying
    to keep up with the joneses. you are right, abby - it''s not how much money you
    spend on your children that counts; it''s how much time you spend with them. how
    else can you teach them proper values? time spent with a child is a gift of love.

    may i give your readers the benefit of my very valuable experience? i address
    this to any woman who is "in love" with a married man: never expect to see him
    on sundays or holidays. never call him at home. don''t ever expect him to take
    you out in public, but be prepared to entertain him at your place. he may bring
    a bottle of wine or the steaks occasionally, but in actual dollars and cents,
    you will spend more on him than he''ll spend on you. never depend on him in times
    of personal crisis. don''t believe him when he tells you his wife is a shrew,
    cold, homely, too fat (or too thin) and hasn''t slept with him for 10 years. don''t
    ever expect his wife to divorce him - even if she catches him. she knows you are
    not his first and won''t be his last. also, she is not about to give up her social
    status, financial security and retirement income because of you. however, her
    discovery will probably terminate his affair with you, so be prepared to get some
    new clothes, circulate, and find another married man whose wife is a shrew, cold,
    homely, too fat (or too thin) and hasn''t slept with him for 10 years. sign me

    that letter from "no name or town" really hit home with me. while dating my second
    - and definitely last - husband, i made what could have been a horrible mistake
    by telling him in vague terms about some premarital experiences i had. he seemed
    amused and intrigued. after we were married, he would occasionally tease me about
    my former lovers, but i noticed a bitter edge creeping into his tone. after a
    number of these little zingers, i realized that he was concerned about his own
    performance. then i told him with absolute honesty, "i wish i''d been a virgin
    for you, but no one has ever satisfied me as often or fully as you do; you must
    not realize how much it hurts me to be reminded of my past mistakes." but i believe
    what really clinched it was the baldest truth (i swear) of all: "darling," i said,
    "don''t you understand that all the time i was looking for you?" once i said that,
    with tears in his eyes, he smothered me with kisses - and the subject never came

    usually smile, but i''ve had a lot of fun with my name, which never fails to provoke
    some kind of comment. i have three sisters and one brother. here''s a family favorite:
    when our mother went to the doctor to find out if she was pregnant, the doctor
    got up and walked over to the window and searched the sky. mother asked, "what
    are you looking for?" the doctor replied, "i''m looking for an angel." mother
    asked, "why an angel?" the doctor replied, "because you''re a virgin about to
    give birth." when my sister mary went to college, one of her professors was calling
    roll on the first day of class. he said, "mary virgin? what an unusual name. do
    you have any sisters or brothers?" my sister replied with a straight face, "well,
    there''s mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james . . ." that''s when the
    professor backed off. i''m a practicing catholic and i mean no disrespect when
    i make jokes about my name, but with a name like virgin, we girls had to develop
    a sense of humor. elizabeth a. virgin'

    last week, i broke up with the man i''ve been seeing for nearly a year and a half.
    i''m 27 with two small children. my friend, whom i''ll call "jerry," is 38 and
    married. i am divorced and work full time trying to make ends meet. jerry helped
    me pay my bills and took care of my children and me financially. the problem:
    his marriage, his card playing, his telling me he''d come over and never showing
    up - or he''d show up three or four hours late. in the beginning of our relationship,
    i told him i''d wait forever for him to "get his life together," leave his wife,
    etc. it seems my waiting was futile until the day i told him i didn''t want to
    see him anymore. now, all of a sudden, changes are going to be made. in the meantime,
    i have started dating someone else. he''s 31, single, good with the kids and takes
    me to nice places. this is the first time in my life i''ve had the opportunity
    to date. so - what''s my problem? should i believe that jerry is really leaving
    his wife? is it worth the financial security to stay with this man, or should
    i try it on my own? it is so hard. i have no family here to help me, and my ex-husband
    is giving me a hard time because i had his wages attached for child support. do
    people ever really change, abby? waiting for a change'

    i''ve always gotten along well with my neighbors, but listen to this: the woman
    next door has a lovely peace rosebush. last june she planned to take a large bouquet
    to decorate our church, but when she came out early sunday morning to cut the
    roses, she discovered that the bush had been stripped! meanwhile, guests we had
    for dinner on saturday night brought me a large bouquet of peace roses, which
    i had placed in our front window. when my neighbor discovered that her roses were
    gone and saw the bouquet in my window, she rang my doorbell, practically forced
    her way into my house, took my flowers and said some terrible things to me. i
    was too shocked to respond. now it turns out that following the episode, another
    neighbor had come to her to apologize for her preteen daughter, who had sneaked
    into her yard that saturday evening and stolen her roses! my neighbor''s husband
    says his wife is too embarrassed to face me, and i should swallow my pride, go
    over there and make up with her. abby, i can''t forget those shameful things she
    said to me. i feel terrible about the whole thing, but since she''s in the wrong,
    i think she should come here and apologize to me. how can this be settled so we
    can be friends again? rose fever'

    one or a sandwich? millie in maryland'

    i am a 23-year-old woman who is taking over a prosperous family business started
    by my grandfather. this is a small town, and my grandfather formed some valuable
    business relationships with men who are still very important to the success of
    our business. the problem is that these "gentlemen" find me quite attractive.
    so much, in fact, that i have found myself backed up against the wall, hugged,
    squeezed and generally mauled by these kindly old buzzards, while they keep reminding
    me that they''ve been good customers for more than four decades. if these men
    were my age, i could handle them, but they''re all over 65, and trying singlehandedly
    (and soemtimes double-handedly) to close the generation gap. is there a way to
    keep this business (and myself) on our feet? edgy'

    my husband and i have been married for 16 years, and not once has he brought me

    when i ask him what it is, he says, "open it and you''ll find out." and when i
    do, i find a plain card without his signature or my name on it. i have told him
    repeatedly that if he can''t take the trouble to put my name on the card and sign

    he told me that if i was going out, to buy myself a card. i told him i wouldn''t
    do it, so when he came home, he handed me another unsigned card in a paper sack.

    a ride with a stranger, no matter how nice he appears to be. i happen to be a
    decent man, but you took an awful chance. you can''t tell anything about a man

    my dad has been bald for years. i have seen pictures of him when he had hair,
    and they just don''t look like dad. mom got him to get a hairpiece - the kind
    they cut and style for the individual. when dad came home with it, he looked so
    strange to me. he is 44 years old, abby, and he doesn''t have to look like a kid
    of 20. mom is crazy about it, and i''m not sure whether dad wears it to please
    mom or himself, but he wears it all the time. i can''t get used to it. do you
    think he ought to wear it or not? his daughter (age 18)'

    what would your reaction be if a young woman who worked for your husband named
    her baby after him? well, that''s my problem, and i''m still upset about it. this
    girl has worked for my husband for about two years. she''s only 22, but that''s
    old enough to know better. i wonder what her husband thinks. it seems to me that
    they could have found someone in his or her family to name their baby after. we
    were invited to the christening. my husband went, but i said i had a headache

    "not afraid of the dark," who complains about searchlights glaring into the sky,
    is talking about "light pollution." this little-known type of pollution is gradually
    stealing the pleasure of sky-viewing from tens of millions of people. bright skies
    hide the stars and planets from us. light that shines upward is wasted. a few
    communities, largely near major observatories, have ordinances requiring hoods.
    why should we pay for light that doesn''t go where we want it? we should all try
    to limit light pollution by having our own lights and our town and city lights
    shine only on the ground, not above the horizontal, and by shutting off those
    lights whenever they are not needed. jay m. pasachoff, professor of astronomy,

    travels the bridge of your nose? could you use in shingling the roof of your mouth
    the nails on the ends of your toes? could the crook in your elbow be sent to jail?
    if so, what did he do? how can you sharpen your shoulder blades, i''ll be darned
    if i know, do you? can you sit in the shade of the palm of your hand and play
    on the drum of your ear? do the calves of our legs eat the corn on our toes, then
    why does it grow on the ear?'

    can you stand one more letter about grown children who do not visit their parents?
    my mother complains to her friends that i rarely visit - but here''s the reason
    why: every time i''ve visited my mother in the past 20 years (i''m 40 now), i''ve
    been subjected to a barrage of criticism about my hair, my clothes, my weight,
    my friends, my job, my car, my home and other relatives i visit who are not on
    her "approved" list. if i express an opinion with which she does not agree she
    flies into a rage and invites me to leave. mother found other things to do on
    the day i graduated from high school (as valedictorian), the day i graduated from
    college (with honors), the day i got my ph.d. (with distinction), the day i moved
    into my first apartment, and the day i bought my first house. in 1989, i was living
    in san francisco when a big earthquake occurred. my home sustained minor damage
    and we were without electricity and full phone service for several days. when
    i finally got an open phone line, it was 8:30 p.m. the day after the quake. the
    first phone call was to my mother to let her know i was safe. her reaction? she
    was upset because i woke her up. my mother is an angry and bitter woman with little
    room in her life for laughter, joy or outside interests. i find my visits with
    her to be full of sadness, frustration and stress. no matter what i do or say,
    i always come away feeling like a failure. that is why i keep my visits to a minimum.

    i am 28 years old and am engaged to marry a wonderful man. when making out our
    guest list, i have run into a dilemma that i''m hoping you (or perhaps a reader
    who has solved this problem) can help me with. i grew up in a home with an abusive
    mother and an absent father. at the age of 16, i began to have suicidal thoughts
    and was placed under the care of a psychiatrist. through countless hours of therapy
    (years, actually) my doctor gave me his listening ear and caring heart. he has
    helped me deal with the turmoil of my upbringing and gave me the "tools" with
    which i was able to forgive my mother before her recent death. in short, my psychiatrist
    turned a severely depressed and confused young girl into a confident and happy
    woman. my question: would it be appropriate to invite him and his wife to my wedding?
    i am planning a large informal wedding, and requesting that no one bring gifts.
    my doctor knows some of the other guests socially, so he and his wife would be
    comfortable. a close friend told me that it would be inappropriate to invite my
    doctor. what do you think? happy bride-to-be'

    i have worked in a state government office for 15 years and take pride in my work.
    several women are now being allowed to bring in their babies all day, even though
    many child-care options are available to them. our old building has very few amenities
    - no lunchroom, no clean bathroom, or any kind of privacy provided for the majority
    of employees. many of my work colleagues now spend a good portion of their day
    fussing over these babies instead of working. the mothers bring their babies into
    meetings and do not have the courtesy to leave if the babies start crying or fussing
    or need to be breast-fed. the office manager brings in his own handicapped child
    at his convenience, so my complaints that babies and children are very distracting
    in an office, especially when trying to meet deadlines, have fallen on deaf ears.
    abby, what do you and your readers think of babies and children being allowed
    in public offices with their parents? perturbed in washington'

    carl and i met five years ago. i moved in after a year and a half. he felt that
    i was too fat because i was 10 pounds overweight. i disappointed him because i
    never got my weight down from 128 to 118. (i''m 5 foot 6.) so i moved out (my
    choice). after a couple of days of living alone, he begged me to come back and
    i moved back in. about nine months later i moved out. again, it was my choice.
    he did not want to marry me and i wanted to begin to plan my future. i stayed
    away about a month, during which he was pleading with me to come back and promising
    he would change. when i went to pick up my furniture, he cried and told me he
    couldn''t live without me - he wanted to get married. i moved back in and we became
    engaged. he wanted to get married immediately, but i insisted that we wait. which
    brings us to today: we went out with another couple last saturday night and wound
    up getting into an argument. he felt i wasn''t paying enough attention to him.
    (i was laughing a lot with my girlfriend.) when we got home, he wouldn''t speak
    to me for two days. the wedding is a week away, and now he is saying that the
    wedding is off because i don''t love him enough! i am 27, never married, have
    a college degree and a steady job, and am considered attractive. he is 31, married
    once at 21, no kids. am i crazy for still wanting to marry him? he can be generous,

    many years ago when i lived in the midwest, i was married to an abusive man who
    forced me to write a bad check. it was so long ago that i''m fuzzy about the details.
    it happened sometime between 1968-''72. the check wasn''t more than $10 or $20,
    but when it bounced, the service station manager who had cashed it had me arrested.
    i don''t remember if it was a county or a city jail. i was fingerprinted, paid
    a fine, as i recall, made good on the check and was released. i spent no time
    in jail, and that was the end of it. it was the only trouble i have ever been
    in my whole life. now the problem: i am interested in a job with a nationally
    known company. as part of its employee screening process, everyone is fingerprinted
    and the prints are sent to washington, d.c. i need to know if my "record" will
    show up. a couple of my friends work there, and i want this job badly, but before
    i will embarrass myself or them, i''d pass up the job. can you help? i don''t

    i am a 21-year-old college student. my boyfriend and i have dated for three years
    and plan to marry eventually. my boyfriend makes no demands on me. however, i
    have done his laundry four times in the three years we have dated when he was
    pressed for time. my mother and father are furious about this but can''t explain
    why. when i meet women, one of the first things they ask me is if i do my boyfriend''s
    laundry, but they cannot explain why it would be so horrible if i did. even sitcoms
    occasionally touch on the subject. i don''t understand the gravity of the issue.
    then, i read a letter in your column written by a woman who wanted to warn other
    women about doing their boyfriends'' laundry. she said women should break up with
    any man who asks them to wash their clothes. the woman (signed "stupid") did not
    mention in her letter how doing her boyfriend''s laundry made her boyfriend a
    "user," and all your response said was, "thanks for giving other women the benefit
    of your experience." obviously, the woman''s boyfriend was demanding in ways other
    than asking her to do his laundry. and, if he asked her to do his laundry continually,
    she could have said no, even after the first couple of times. by the way, my boyfriend
    has done my laundry three times, and no one thinks he is being used because of
    it. why are people so uptight when women help their boyfriends every once in a

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    keeping the "home" fires burning has been tough for the 6-year-old abc daytime
    program with hosts gary collins and sarah purcell. "home," a how-to guide for
    modern domesticity, draws a loyal audience. but abc, at times, has seemed as bent
    on rubbing it out as a diligent homemaker attacking an embarrassing toilet bowl
    ring. "we have an inside joke here: this is the show that nobody can kill," says
    woody fraser, the show''s creator and executive producer. "every new vice president
    who comes in wants to take aim at `home,'' either because they don''t understand
    the nature of it or don''t like the nature of it." it is a program designed for
    women, fraser says, and that seems to confound the network executives. in july
    1991, abc managed to drive fraser away as producer when the network insisted on
    revamping "home," making it more news-oriented in a bid to increase viewership.
    but ratings plunged, and fraser was lured back in november 1992. in january, abc
    announced that it was canceling "home" in favor of a talk show imported from canada.
    affiliates howled at the prospect of another gabfest, 27,000 viewers sent angry
    letters and abc retreated. the one-hour program, which airs 10 a.m. weekdays on
    wls-ch. 7, was given a vote of confidence with a yearlong contract. recent "home"
    shows have featured such segments as dollar-stretching ideas "every clothes shopper
    should know," recipes for low-fat snacks and a workshop on replacing cracked bathroom
    tiles. weightier issues also get attention. there''s advice from columnist abigail
    van buren-"dear abby"-on solving marital problems, medical updates and a pediatrician''s
    take on child-rearing issues such as parental nudity around children. the studio
    set is comfortable and houselike, perfect for a midmorning kaffeeklatsch with
    friends. the casually dressed collins and purcell are relaxed and low-key. no
    power suits-or acts-here. the information is often meaty, a blend of anecdotal
    experience and professional savvy. the mother of a newborn tells how a temporary
    nanny helped save her sanity; a pediatrician explains the value of such services.
    "i want to give solutions and answers," fraser says. "i''m giving you positive
    possibilities because we are inundated with bad news constantly." crafts segments
    are popular-and a perfect example of why men in the tv industry find "home" hard
    to fathom, says mary alice dwyer-dobbin, abc''s executive vice president of daytime
    programming. "male executives, whether station managers or even executives here
    at the network, watch the screen without the audio on and think, `what is this
    little arts and crafts show?'' " what they''re missing, fraser says, is the ability
    to view the world from outside their perspective. when dennis swanson, abc''s
    daytime programming president, told fraser in 1991 that the show should focus
    on more important issues and events, fraser left, and in the 16 months he was
    away, the ratings fell by nearly half. "dennis called and said: `i made a mistake.
    let''s see what you can do with it,'' " fraser recalls."i took it from the political
    to the practical, if you will. i made it a woman''s show again." even in these
    days of anti-political correctness, it may seem chancy for a man to proclaim he
    speaks for women. but fraser is unapologetic. he feels a special bond with the
    opposite sex. "i happen to know that women are brighter than men," he says. "they''re
    more open and sensitive than men. my wife calls me a soft man. she says i''m a
    feminine man. i don''t mind that. i''ve never minded diapering babies." fraser
    also relies on two of his daughters, both young mothers, to gauge how successful
    "home" is in meeting its audience''s needs. "they find this to be a show that
    gives them information they can really use," he says. "maybe they should have
    been paying more attention to their mother when they were 15, but now they have
    to pay attention." the reborn show''s mission is to keep its homespun soul intact
    but boost ratings. that means more promotion and a higher entertainment quotient,
    says dwyer-dobbin. but not too heavy on the fluff, fraser insists. "if we''re
    too entertaining, then you don''t get the information," he says. "then we hear
    from our audience."'

    i would like some advice on how to say the right thing at the right time. i love
    my husband (common law) very much and he is much smarter and stronger than i.
    when we met, i was living on the street a prostitute. we have been through 4 1/2
    years together and i have always waited on him hand and foot, but only because
    i loved him and enjoyed doing it. then he started taking advantage of it and the
    mind games began, like, "if you don''t do this for me, i''ll do something you''ll
    regret." i am 21 years old and was sexually abused by my father from the time
    i was 8. dad was a big man, 6 foot 2 and 200 pounds. he threatened to kill me
    if i told my mother. it is something i have tried to forget, but i can''t. in
    the past 4 1/2 years, i have tried every birth control device there is and still
    ended up getting pregnant three times. the first two pregnancies ended in abortion
    because i felt too immature to handle the responsibility. actually, i believe
    i could have handled it, but my husband was totally against it, so of course,
    i ended the pregnancies. but when i became pregnant for the third time, i wanted
    a baby. so i gave my husband a choice - either the baby and me, or nothing. our
    son is now 12 months old and a complete angel. but my husband has always doubted
    that our baby is his son, and that hurts. could you recommend some books about
    how to either deal with this or on how to say the right words at the right time?

    my sister "kim" is being married in two months. since our father is deceased,

    i have met my future brother-in-law, "john," a half-dozen times. he has always
    been rather cool toward me-though he has been warmer with the rest of my family.
    when i asked kim about this, she explained that she had told john that i was gay
    (which i am) and that he strongly disapproves of gays! last weekend, i called
    kim to discuss some arrangements pertaining to the wedding, and she told me i
    could arrive the day before the ceremony and indicated that aside from the wedding
    reception, there wouldn''t be any other festivities. today, i called "chuck,"
    a cousin who is invited to the wedding, to see if he would like to share traveling
    expenses. i told him i was driving out on thursday, two days before the wedding.
    chuck then asked me why i wasn''t going on monday, like everyone else, for the
    family dinner that john''s parents are hosting as well as the bachelor party.
    well, i called kim and found out that john and his family don''t want "someone
    like me" around. kim said she had to wheedle to get them to let me come to the
    church, because his family is very religious and they despise gays. he told her
    that my being at their wedding would be "a slap in god''s face." (never mind that
    kim and john have lived together for two years.) abby, i love my sister, but i
    feel hurt, and now i''m not sure i want to lay out the money and time to go where
    i''m not particularly welcome. what should i do? confirmed bachelor, cockeysville,

    i never thought that at 50-plus years old i would feel the fear, shame and stupidity
    i felt sitting in my gynecologist''s office being tested for sexually transmitted
    diseases. the lecture that my kind, caring physician gave me was severe - and
    i deserved it. he said, "women who grew up in the ''father knows best'' age, and
    have unprotected sex in the ''90s, are operating under a false reality." a man
    (and so-called friend) i dated for years never used any kind of protection. now

    to say whether he used protection with the others. well, today it is possible
    to "kiss and kill" - and now, i have had multiple partners because of this man''s
    promiscuity. would you believe i have three grown sons who are smarter than me

    i believe the english language needs three new words - pronouns to take care of
    the "he or she" mess: i.e., "he or she may take his or her deposit to the bank
    whenever it suits him or her." in the past, when males dominated (at least they
    thought they did), it bothered no one to use the masculine pronoun indiscriminately;
    but no more. to use both genders to satisfy all is both annoying and awkward,
    so i suggest: "heesh" instead of he or she. "hirm" instead of her or him. "hizzer"
    instead of his or her. how about it, abby? can we initiate these new words through
    your widely read column? ruth gurry, punta gorda, fla.'

    a close relative had been planning a second marriage, but without telling anyone,

    the wedding and the reception at his family''s home. now we''re getting strong

    mentions eventually having a "religious" ceremony and a reception in the future.

    after reading the letter from "ms. future doctor," i felt the need to write and
    give another view on career sexual stereotypes. i am 27, a registered nurse for
    four years, and a male. i am frequently asked, "when will you become a doctor?"
    or "you''re doing this just to put yourself through medical school, right?" also,
    "what''s the matter, couldn''t you get into medical school?" when i started my
    schooling to become a nurse, i considered medical school, but the further i got
    into nursing, the more i enjoyed being a nurse. i enjoy comforting a patient in
    pain, teaching my patients about their diseases, and holding the hand of someone
    who is frightened and hurting. these feelings are experienced by every nurse,
    and being male did not exclude me from doing them. (most doctors are too busy.)
    i still work hard being a competent and compassionate nurse. more males are choosing
    nursing as a career, and we need to shed our preconceived notions about who nurses
    are and what they look like. also, you used the term "trained nurses." may i remind
    you that physicians are educated in medical school, and nurses are educated in
    nursing schools. monkeys are trained to perform in circuses. mr. nurse in tampa'

    your letters regarding jealous women and stepchildren have prompted me to write
    to you regarding what seem to be several misconceptions concerning stepparents.
    i am now the stepmother of five children, and it is the most difficult situation
    i have ever had to deal with in my life. i fell in love with the father of these
    children - but had i fully realized what was involved, i would have left the country
    and changed my name. i am expected to be chief baby sitter, entertainer, chauffeur,
    nurse, counselor and caretaker of these five children - with none of the say as
    to how they are raised or disciplined. these particular children are about as
    lovable as satan, and i''d attempt an exorcism if i thought there was a priest
    who could survive it. i have tried my level best as a dutiful stepparent, but
    these children would kill mother teresa in a day! taking care of them has landed
    me in the hospital three times in the last two years. i don''t like being treated
    like dirt in my own home by a bunch of kids who have never been taught manners.
    i did not allow them to throw food at the dinner table, which made me about as
    popular as malaria. when these spoiled children are all 18 and scatter to the
    four corners of the globe, their father will be lucky to hear from them on father''s
    day (they don''t bother with it currently). all they want is money, more money
    and things. as soon as i can scrape the funds together, my bags are packed. am

    presbyterian minister in texas p.s. abby, i wrote to you in 1974, asking what
    to do about my weight problem. you suggested overeaters anonymous, and told me
    about its reliance on a higher power. well, i was 14, and not ready to hear that.
    but it stayed with me. i finally attended my first meeting in 1987, and i just
    had my sixth birthday of abstinence from binge eating. the program was a large
    reason for my entry into the ministry, as i got in touch with my own higher power.
    thanks for planting that seed. it has truly flowered.'

    i am writing to you out of concern and confusion. i have been dating a very special
    young lady for 11 months. she is 23, twice married, and has a 2 1/2-year-old daughter.
    i am 29, have never been married and have no children. four months ago, i purchased
    a home, and she and her daughter have been living with me. i am supporting them
    financially. now the problem: she is pressuring me almost daily to marry her soon.
    she says she needs a commitment from me - although neither of us is dating anyone
    else. she tells me that other men want to date her, and are willing to give her
    a commitment of marriage immediately. i think she is telling me this to make me
    jealous, and it hurts me. i do love her, and plan to marry her eventually, but
    not right now. i don''t want to lose her, but i don''t like the pressure she is
    putting on me. i tell her i need more time, but she thinks it''s just an excuse.
    it''s not an excuse; it is how i feel. what should i do? confused and concerned'

    as a waitress, i see many parents who do not seem to have any control, and children
    who seem to have no manners or respect. parents sit there while their children
    are just plain rude to the waiter/waitress and let their children run wild through
    the restaurant. once, i was told by a parent whose 3-year-old nearly knocked me
    over, "when you''re a parent, you just don''t care what your kids are doing because
    you are so worn out you need a break!" (i almost fell over.) i wanted to tell
    her in that case she should have left her kids at home. i just hope that one day
    soon parents will go back to some of the "old ways." children need to learn to
    say "please" and "thank you," "yes, sir" and "no, sir," etc. you do not hear that
    anymore. kids do not tell their parents where they are going or about what time
    they will be home. i am only 25 years old - however, i always told my mother where
    i was going and about what time i would be home. and if i went somewhere else
    or was going to be late, i would call her. i still do it, and not because i have
    to, but because i respect her and do not want her to worry. children need to be
    taught all of these things early in life or, when they are 16 or 17 and uncontrollable,
    parents will go around asking, "where did i go wrong? we gave him/her everything,
    and never asked for anything." society needs to wake up and take a long, hard
    look at things the way they were, the way they are, and where we are headed. if
    you think things are bad now - wait until these children who weren''t taught respect
    and discipline start running things! t.h., smyrna, del.'

    school and the teacher asked the class, "who was christ''s mother?" all replied
    in unison, "mary!" then the teacher asked, "and who was christ''s father?" nobody
    answered for a few moments; then one kid spoke up: "his name was virg." then he
    went on, "all i hear about is virg and mary." another little boy at sunday school
    was told by his teacher that god lives in all our hearts. the little boy replied,
    "no, he doesn''t. every morning, dad knocks on the bathroom door and says, `my

    i keep reading letters in your column from natural mothers who don''t want to
    be found by the children they gave up for adoption. every time i read one of those
    letters, i feel both angry and hurt. angry because of the selfishness of these
    women, and hurt because i am adopted and it hurts to think that my natural mother
    doesn''t even want to know me. no matter what the reason for giving us up for
    adoption, the bottom line is that we live our lives feeling rejected by our "real"
    mothers - the women who gave birth to us. these women are more concerned about
    the questions that might be raised and the problems it would cause than they are
    about knowing the kind of people we turned out to be. is it fair for us to grow
    up feeling that we were never really wanted in the first place? being adopted
    isn''t easy - always wondering if i look like my mother, wondering if she remembers
    me on my birthday, or if she ever regrets having given me up. maybe she''s dead,
    or maybe she''s the lady who was standing next to me in the grocery store last
    week. i love my adoptive parents and i owe them more than i can ever repay. they
    gave me the best life they could, and they''ll always be my "real" parents. but
    there''s someone missing, someone i''m afraid to look for, because if i find her,
    she may reject me again. just another adopted kid'

    i recently leased a studio apartment in a small complex - it''s just the right

    i share a wall is a prostitute and drug addict. people come and go at all hours
    of the night, and the television is on 24 hours a day. it stops for maybe three

    in a recent column, you wrote that several calendar manufacturers had yet to come
    up with a way to abbreviate the year 2000. since the letter "m" is also a roman

    my sister is 10 years older than i am, and lives on the other side of the continent.
    we are both married and have children. i have not heard from her for two years.
    she and her kids call my mother and other sister on an intermittent basis, but
    she never calls me. no letters, no christmas cards, no thank-you notes for gifts
    i send to her and her family. i have no idea why she is shutting me out. i have
    pretty much decided to quit trying to contact her. my resentment of her silence
    has been festering for so long i''m afraid to call her for fear she will hurt
    me more, or i will overreact and say something stupid. i don''t want to necessarily
    shut her children out, but since they are now teenagers and have yet to write
    or call to thank me for birthday and christmas gifts, i have decided not to send
    them anything else. i think about my sister frequently. it makes me sad, but i''m

    with you that i have used for many years, when speaking to audiences on the subject
    of old age and retirement. (the author is unknown.) on opening his new store,
    a man received a bouquet of flowers. he became dismayed on reading the enclosed
    card, which expressed deep sympathy. while puzzling over the message, his telephone
    rang. it was the florist, apologizing for having sent the wrong card. "oh, it''s
    all right," said the storekeeper. "i''m a businessman and i understand how these
    things can happen." "but," added the florist, "i sent your card to a funeral party."

    my fiance and i recently attended the wedding of two acquaintances we hardly knew

    shoved a video camera into my fiance''s hand and told him (not asked - but told)
    that he was to tape the wedding reception and go around asking the guests if they
    had any advice for the bride and groom - on camera. naturally we were caught off-guard,
    so we tried to make the best of it. when i asked who delegated this task to us,
    the bride replied, "i did. my sister''s boyfriend was supposed to do it, but they
    broke up last night and he''s not here." next thing i knew, the bride told me
    that videotapes hold six hours of stuff, so i should be able to get the entire
    reception - "and don''t forget to get us leaving the reception in the limo!" well,
    i went around asking the guests what advice they had for the newlyweds just like
    i was asked to do. anyway, i haven''t given them a wedding gift yet, but i''m
    considering sending them a card saying, "hope you enjoy the video!" after all,

    it begins: "good morning, mrs. anderson "how do you feel today? "i just dropped
    by to cheer you up "while passing by this way. "how long have you been ill, my
    dear? "you''re such a sight to see "how very thin and pale you are, "you''re sure

    upon all of those blessings for which we can be thankful. how''s your health?
    only a few minor complaints? well, thank god they''re not major. if you are reading
    this - you''re still here. you can probably think of at least one person who isn''t
    around this year. (i know i can.) if you awakened this morning and were able to
    hear the birds sing, or read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one) -
    praise the lord! a lot of people could not. (say a prayer for those who were injured,
    or who have perished, in fire, flood, earthquake or war.) how''s your pocketbook?
    thin? you''re not alone. but many people in the world are a lot poorer, and are
    making do with far less than we americans. are you lonely? well, the way to have
    a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, don''t stand on ceremony, pick up
    the phone and call someone. go out of your way to do something nice for someone.
    it''s a sure cure for the holiday blues. are you concerned about your country''s
    future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern - concern for fair treatment
    under the law. in america we can cast a secret ballot or criticize our government
    without fearing a knock on the head or a knock on our door in the middle of the
    night. freedom rings! you can worship in the church of your choice (or not worship
    at all - if that''s your choice). as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving
    prayer. perhaps you will want to use it at your table tomorrow. let one of the
    children read it: "oh, heavenly father, we thank thee for food, and remember the
    hungry. "we thank thee for health, and remember the sick. "we thank thee for friends,
    and remember the friendless. "we thank thee for freedom, and remember the enslaved.
    "may these remembrances stir us to service, "that thy gifts to us may be used
    for others. amen." may the spirit of thanksgiving be shared by one and all! have
    a wonderful holiday, and may god bless you and yours. p.s. why not invite a friend
    who lives alone to share a thanksgiving meal - or, better yet, call and say, "i''m
    coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." try it, and let me know how
    your day was. thought for the day: "the measure of a man''s real character is

    the table and a toddler threw cheerios all over the floor. this was very annoying
    to the other customers, not to mention the wait staff. so i turned to another
    waitress nearby and said: "i hope someone doesn''t run into one of those kids
    and spill hot coffee on them. remember last week when that little girl was burned
    all over her face?" the mother promptly ordered her children to go sit in their
    chairs, and stay there. of course, there never was any "little girl who had her
    face burned," though this could very well have been a true story. servers often

    you were way off base with your advice to "what to wear?" whether we like it or
    not, society places a significant amount of emphasis on physical appearance. in
    a couple of weeks i''m going to my 20th class reunion, and i''m wearing a black
    mini-dress. i exercise daily and watch my diet. i''m a confident, attractive woman
    with a high-paying career and two fine grown children. for work, i dress conservatively,
    but in the evening, i am more daring. my advice would have been, "wear that dress.
    i hope you turn every head in the room." hartford, conn.'

    this is in response to the letter from "cathy in pittsburgh," the waitress who
    told about six women coming into the restaurant with a cake, ordering coffee only,
    and asking the waitress to serve the cake. i think i can top that. for my birthday,
    my mom took my sister and me to a restaurant for lunch. mom had brought a small,
    decorated birthday cake along to celebrate the occasion. when we finished with
    lunch, the waitress brought out a knife and three plates for our cake; then she
    told us that the kitchen help had asked if we would let them have a piece, too.
    thinking that a couple of pieces of cake wouldn''t hurt, mom said, "sure, how
    many pieces do you need?" the waitress said, "ten pieces should do it." needless
    to say, we were appalled that she had the gall to ask for that many pieces, but
    mom had already said yes, so she cut 10 pieces and ended up with just enough cake
    to serve the three of us. kathy in portland'

    i think i can top the story about the ladies who brought a cake into a restaurant
    and asked the waitress to cut it and serve it. i was on duty as head cook in a
    cafeteria one sunday afternoon when the cashier came back and asked how much she
    should charge for a cup of hot water. i told her we didn''t charge for hot water.
    then she said, "but the customer wants 12 cups!" i went out to the dining room
    and saw 12 people seated around two tables they had pushed together. they had
    taken plates, silverware and napkins from the buffet table and wanted us to serve
    the chow mein they had purchased from a takeout restaurant down the street. they
    had brought their own tea bags to steep tea in our cups! dessert was fortune cookies

    as the holiday season approaches, may i speak for all of us who work at agencies

    clothing-and i don''t mean to be ungrateful-but i wish your readers would keep
    these suggestions in mind: (1) if it''s too worn, or stained, or out of style
    for your child to wear, our kids won''t want to wear it either. self-esteem is
    as important for these children as it is for others. (2) if a toy is broken, or
    part of it is missing, our children can''t play with it either. you''d be surprised
    at the number of people who simply empty the entire contents of a toy box containing
    broken crayons and stray game pieces into a plastic bag, and drop it off as a
    donation. (3) older children, especially teenagers, are often overlooked this
    time of year. agencies that are swamped with gifts for younger children often
    have a hard time finding anything for older brothers and sisters. (4) some agencies
    appreciate gifts of money so that they can fill a particular need or a special
    wish. abby, please let your readers know that donations (large and small) are

    with the holidays just around the corner, i recall that last year you printed
    a letter from a geriatric nurse who made some wonderful suggestions for what to
    give to people who live in nursing homes. i have another suggestion for older
    people who are not in the best of health. my own grandmother was confined to a
    bed or wheelchair for several years, and had difficulty communicating because
    of parkinson''s disease, but "grams" remained alert and oriented, and she retained
    her memory and sense of humor. four years ago, i, too, had difficulty deciding
    on a christmas gift for her, then i hit upon an idea that became a ritual during
    my visits to her in the nursing home. first, i would soak her hands in warm, soapy
    water, then clean, trim and file her fingernails, and finally, apply nail polish.
    then i washed her face, brushed her hair and cleaned her eyeglasses. finally,
    i would soak her feet in sudsy water and give her a foot massage. she would always
    tell me how good it felt to have her hands and feet massaged, and her legs and
    arms gently stretched. all the while we would chat, or quietly enjoy each other''s
    company. the cost? next to nothing, except for my time and attention, the most
    valuable gift i could give her. joann p. seaver, byron, calif.'

    is nothing wrong with being left-handed. it is just the way a person is born.

    i am involved in a situation and am curious as to what the proper etiquette is.
    i was in a bridal party, and three weeks before the wedding, the bride decided
    not to go through with it. this was after the bridesmaids'' gowns and matching
    shoes had been purchased and two showers given. one of the showers was paid for
    by the bridesmaids, plus the shower gifts. the bride claims she is going to keep
    the shower gifts because they are not "wedding gifts" and it would be too expensive
    to return all of them. she also claims that technically, all the bridesmaids''
    gowns should be paid in full by us since they were ours (some of us just put the
    deposit down). i feel that she is completely wrong and that it is her responsibility
    to return all the shower gifts, as there is no wedding; she should also reimburse
    us for any expenses incurred. there are no extenuating circumstances here-just
    a classic case of cold feet. what is the correct thing to do? i think the ex-bride

    she didn''t want to be referred to as my stepdaughter. she goes out of her way
    to be rude and does things out of pure spite. for her dad''s sake, i have ignored
    them as much as possible, as he is 83 years old and in poor health. it all came
    to a head while i was in the hospital in july for gallbladder surgery. this daughter
    came to visit her dad and, instead of fixing him nourishing meals, she took it
    upon herself to scrape all the wallpaper off my living room walls and paint them
    an ugly green-convincing her dad that it would be a "surprise" for me. it certainly
    was! my own daughter happened by the hospital and told me about it. i was so upset,
    i had a severe setback. my "stepdaughter" fled into the night. she didn''t wait
    until i was out of the hospital. my husband can''t see what''s wrong with a person
    entering another person''s home and doing this without the owner''s permission.
    not only that, but he also mailed her a large sum of money as a reimbursement.

    a 7-year-old? i desperately need someone to talk this over with. as of right now,

    while because of our hectic schedules. last august, i gave sarah $85 to purchase
    something for me in a store next to her office building. it has been nearly four
    months, and i still haven''t received what she promised to pick up-and she did
    not return my money, either. i have a feeling that she spent it. well, six weeks
    ago sarah lent me $80 because i ran short and payday wasn''t for another week.
    when she handed me the money, she said i could pay her back later. can you believe
    her nerve? my question: should i "forget" to give her the $80 and not mention
    it again? or should i remind her about the money i gave her last summer? we have
    both been busy, so i haven''t seen her since the latest incident. what do you
    think? wavering in washington'

    "asian-american in alabama" wrote to say that even though he was born and raised
    in montgomery, ala., he had been stopped by strangers who asked, "where are you
    from?" well, abby, i was born in the united states, as were my parents, my grandparents
    and my great-grandparents. on my father''s side, the records are not quite clear,
    but he can trace his family back to colonial days. however, despite my german
    ancestry, it would never occur to me to call myself a german-american. i am an
    american. when world war ii broke out, my father didn''t wrestle with his german
    ancestry. he was an american. he fought the nazis in africa, in italy, in france
    and in germany. i am getting tired of people who insist on hyphenating americans.
    they refer to afro-americans, asian-americans, native americans, italian-americans,
    mexican-americans, etc. "asian-american in alabama" said, "the only authentic
    americans in the united states are the american indians," which isn''t true, as
    they also came from somewhere else. my family has been in america long enough
    for me to qualify as a native american. in fact, i even have some indian blood
    in my veins. my advice to "asian-american in alabama": the next time you are asked,
    "where are you from?" or, worse yet, "what are you?" proudly reply, "i''m an american!"

    in answering "asian-american in alabama," you missed the implied racism in the
    question, "where are you from?" as a caucasian woman married to an asian-american,
    i have become acutely aware that racism still exists. my german family and my
    husband''s japanese family came to the united states at about the same time. my
    husband''s family spoke english sooner and acquired american mannerisms sooner,
    yet they were often asked, "where are you from?" and, "where is the best japanese
    restaurant in town?" such questions were never asked of me or my family, probably
    because we looked "american"-while my husband''s family looked "foreign." marilyn

    i am a 70-year-old widow who lives alone. about 11:15 one evening, i was awakened

    was so relieved. he knew where to find my outside house key, which i keep hidden

    safe. larry is 15. he apologized for frightening me, and explained that he was
    in the neighborhood and wanted to pick up his duffel bag containing his sweat
    suit and gym suit. (he had spent the night in my house the week before.) larry
    begged me not to tell his father, who is my son. so far, i haven''t told. maybe

    my mother told a friend that her son and his wife were expecting their first child.
    the friend said, "oh, how nice-your first grandchild!" innocent enough, except
    my parents already have a grandchild-he is my son, whom we adopted as an infant.
    my mother was furious. she asked the person, politely, "have you forgotten alex?"
    (not his real name), to which he replied, "well, no, but this is a real grandchild-you
    know, a blood relative." abby, you would not believe the questions some people
    ask about adopted children. for the uninitiated, here are a few tips: (1) don''t
    make remarks or ask questions about his "real" parents. his adopted family are
    his "real" parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. (2) don''t ask why his parents
    didn''t want him-especially not in front of the child. (3) don''t ask how much
    he "cost" us. (believe it or not, i have been asked this several times.) he cost
    us nothing. we did, however, pay our attorney, his birth parent''s attorney, some
    medical bills and the agency fees. (4) if you are a schoolteacher, don''t ask
    your students to do a "family tree." chances are, there is an adopted child in
    your class. (5) don''t ask me who our son looks like. how should we know? "a real

    (2) gift certificates for the recipient''s favorite grocery store, deli or department
    store. (food sure beats trinkets.) (3) a "picker-upper" with a yardlong handle
    for retrieving items from overhead shelves, or things dropped behind the sofa.
    (4) postage stamps and postcards. (seniors, remember when you could send a letter
    for 2 cents-and a penny postcard had a stamp on it?) (5) if you must give clothing,
    please let the recipient select it-that way, you can be sure the size is right,
    ditto the fabric and style. (6) if you''re sure the senior wants a puppy-give
    one that''s weaned, housebroken, spayed or neutered, and include some pet food,
    a water dish, doggie bed, leash and two collars-and make one the next size up;
    puppies grow. (7) if the senior says, "please don''t give me anything," translate
    that to mean: "no trinkets or dust-catchers that take up valuable space in an
    already crowded apartment." it could also mean, "i don''t need things, but i would
    appreciate a short visit from you regularly, but please telephone the day before,
    and try not to interrupt my afternoon nap." (8) if you''re far away, please write
    some news about yourself and mutual friends. also, i don''t understand your "pc
    460 with a billion k-bytes of ram and a mouse or a tiger." and please send me
    a subscription to a newspaper containing dear abby. (9) consider some homemade
    coupons for housecleaning, seasonal yard cleanup, or a day at a museum, art show,
    petting zoo, shopping mall or the public library. (10) if the oldster is financially
    secure and doesn''t need "things" or errands run, your presence will mean more
    than your presents. you could also make a donation to the person''s favorite charity-not
    yours. love ya, abby. runa zenda siranush, sierra vista, ariz.'

    ten years ago, after 18 years of marriage, my husband left me for a silicone princess.
    my college-age son said, "fight fire with fire," so i went to a plastic surgeon
    and had a "utes"-upper torso enhancement surgery. i went from a 32b to a 36dd.
    you cannot believe how it changed my life. i needed a job, and i was hired on
    the first interview. my first day on the job, i was asked to dinner by three single
    men. a year later, i married a man 10 years my junior. he''s wonderful; he doesn''t
    smoke, drink, swear or nag, and he adores me. i am in heaven! he told me after
    we were married that he was attracted to me because of my figure. i was tempted
    to tell him it wasn''t always this way, but i couldn''t get the words out. i love

    the hectic work week. so what''s the problem? most people return our invitations,
    and during the winter months they invite us to their homes, include us in sporting
    activities, or whatever is going on-except for one couple. we have never had a
    meal in their home-or even been asked to watch a video for an evening-yet they
    are more than eager to be entertained by us. she does not work, is not involved
    in any organizations, and they have no children-but she complains incessantly
    about how "busy" she is. this may seem petty, but it hurts never to be included
    in anything they do. after many years of this, we decided not to invite them to
    our cottage this summer. whenever i see her, she hints to be asked. what do i

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    everywhere you go, bill clinton has begun to hurtle toward that never-never land
    where people look upon him with contempt and cartoonists portray him as a perplexed
    kid in high socks and breeches. he has no political pull. democrats have lost
    all nine races for open congressional or statewide offices since clinton''s election,
    and many candidates have passed along word that they would love the president''s
    help in raising money, as long as he doesn''t insist on getting any pictures taken
    with them. the president blames his troubles on a lot of people, such as republicans
    eager to prevent him from "giving you health" and unnamed "powerful forces" in
    the press. but he created his own problems when he promised in 1992 to serve as
    a kind of yahoo messiah, a man born of mean circumstances but high principles,
    someone destined to lead us to new heights of prosperous virtue. people believed
    this hokum for the same reason that lonely folks scribbled checks to jim bakker:
    americans love bold promisers. even now, letters flood into the white house at
    an unprecedented pace, and writers pour out their personal fears and hopes more
    directly and heartbreakingly than they do to dear abby. meanwhile, out on the
    hustings, people treat him like another guy. a reporter''s daughter asked him,
    "boxers or briefs?"-and he answered with a classic clinton straddle: both. after
    nearly 18 months in office and jillions of hours on television, bill clinton remains
    an enigma. he feigns candor but refuses to answer simple questions about his behavior
    and financial history. indeed, he lies with shocking frequency on at least the
    second topic. he is an absolutely likable human being, much to the consternation
    of those who want to paint him as the most evil person this side of stalin. he
    listens well, he feels genuine emotions and he can achieve something almost like
    eloquence on the topic of race. yet when you try to patch together the pieces
    of his political mosaic, no comprehensible picture takes shape. you find no great
    crusade. you see only a man eager to refute lincoln''s axiom that you can''t fool
    (or please) all the people all the time. far from being a revolutionary, as any
    good president must be, bill clinton is the consummate apple polisher. he has
    made his way through life by saying the right things to the right people, never
    getting a bad mark for deportment in school or a bad recommendation from an elder.
    he probably sat in the front of his class. the attempt to craft a cult of personality
    has failed because he seems to have none. he has invented and reinvented himself
    in order to please whoever would judge him next and has done so with such skill
    that nobody can tell for sure who the real bill clinton is. the sum of his many
    strengths is an endearing weakness, the desire for unfiltered affection and admiration.
    his bond with the american public is not one of leader and followers. it is more
    like the relationship between a dependent man and a mass of supportive codependents.
    he does not chase an impossible dream so much as a fat file of polling results.
    in short, we have a president who has made us all part of his continuing battle
    for political survival-a hollow man who could go out not with a bang but with
    a whimper.'

    why all the commotion about how to stop a rooster from crowing? roosters instinctively
    crow for a reason. their biological clock is set by their hormones. a rooster
    crows to wake up the hens early in the morning to let them know that it''s time
    to get off their perches and get with it if they want chicks to hatch from their
    eggs. a rooster will crow if he is upset, or to let us know that there is going
    to be a change in the weather. (roosters sense rain, storms and violent weather,
    and it''s their way of sending out an alarm.) abby, this is not a scientific explanation;

    my husband, who is normally a kind and loving man, recently told me that he finds
    my body size troubling. i''m 5 feet 3 inches, weigh 204 pounds and have tried
    every diet under the sun. i doubt if there''s a weight-loss plan that anyone could
    suggest that i haven''t tried. my question, however, is not about another kind
    of weight-loss program. what i''d be interested in knowing is this: how do other
    men with fat wives deal with it-especially those whose wives got fat after their
    marriage? are they embarrassed in front of friends? do they have affairs, or fantasize
    about thin women? or do they say nothing and quietly hate their wives? does criticizing
    bring a change? do they decide to resist cultural standards of weight? or do they
    ignore it and love the other qualities their wives have? please ask your male
    readers, abby. i''m very interested in what they might have to say-but they are
    not the kind of questions you ask some man sitting in the local fast-food restaurant.
    thank you! fat but not happy'

    my daughter recently graduated from a very prestigious college. each graduate
    was given a limited number of tickets, as there were many graduates in an auditorium
    with a limited seating capacity. while i expected to see people of all ages, i
    did not expect to see small children and infants. some parents did not hold the
    little ones on their laps; they let the youngsters jump around during the ceremony!
    and some with babies spent the entire time carrying them up and down the aisles
    trying to calm them. let''s face it, it is difficult even for a parent to be interested
    in hundreds of graduates and speakers; how on earth do parents of these children
    expect them to act? this is a wonderful moment for the parents and grandparents
    of graduates-but never on god''s green earth would i do something as stupid as
    bringing an infant to a graduation ceremony. annoyed in massachusetts'

    and embarrassed by his off-color jokes, but he continues to call daily with yet
    another dirty joke. last week he came to a family gathering with a newspaper ad

    regarding smoking and the tobacco industry: where are the george washington carvers
    of our day? i do not smoke, and because i have asthma, bronchitis and allergies,
    i have trouble when i''m in the presence of tobacco smoke. however, i cannot believe
    the good lord made this beautiful plant without many purposes in mind. george
    washington carver (1864-1943), a black educator and botanist, developed more than
    300 products from the peanut and 200 from the sweet potato. i challenge the george
    washington carvers of our day to get busy in their laboratories and develop products
    from the tobacco plant. the list of possible products, i feel certain, would be
    endless: foods, food supplements, animal products, garden products, fertilizers,
    building materials, etc. if dr. carver found 300 products in the peanut and 200
    in the sweet potato, surely there are dozens of products yet undiscovered in the
    tobacco plant, making it possible for tobacco farmers to prosper. mrs. eilene

    my husband and i, both in our 60s, recently had the most disappointing weekend

    out on the lake. we could have cried. dad and i fished off the dock alone. when
    the kids returned late that evening, they said, "we thought you''d be tired after
    that long drive, so when our friends stopped by, we took them out on the lake
    to fish." not wanting to upset them, we didn''t tell them how hurt we were. do

  body: 'dear readers: have you noticed that in recent years there seem to be fewer
    patriotic americans flying "old glory" on flag day, memorial day and the 4th of
    july? perhaps this moving piece will stir others to action as it did me. your
    flag hello. remember me? some people call me old glory, others call me the star-spangled
    banner, but whatever they call me, i am your flag, the flag of the united states
    of america. something has been bothering me, so i thought i might talk it over
    with you-because it is about you and me. i remember some time ago, people would
    line up on both sides of the street to watch the parade, and naturally i was leading
    every one, proudly waving in the breeze. when your daddy saw me coming, he immediately
    removed his hat and placed it against his left shoulder so that his hand was directly
    over his heart-remember? and you, i remember, were standing there, straight as
    a soldier. you didn''t have a hat, but you were giving the right salute. remember
    your little sister? not to be outdone, she was saluting the same as you with her
    right hand over her heart-remember? what happened? i''m still the same old flag.
    oh, i''ve added a few more stars since you were a boy, and a lot more blood has
    been shed since those parades of long ago. but now, somehow i don''t feel as proud
    as i used to feel. when i come down your street, you just stand there with your
    hands in your pockets. you may give me a small glance, and then you look away.
    i saw one man take his hat off, then he looked around, and when he didn''t see
    anybody else take off his hat, he quickly put his on again. is it a sin to be
    patriotic today? have you forgotten what i stand for, and where i have been? anzio,
    guadalcanal, korea and vietnam! take a look at the memorial honor rolls, and see
    the names of those patriotic americans who gave their lives to keep this republic
    free. when you salute me, you are actually saluting them. well, it won''t be long
    until i''ll be coming down your street again. so when you see me, please stand
    straight and place your hand over your heart, and i''ll know that you remembered.
    i''ll salute you by waving back!'

    when my son was 2 1/2, i gave him a doll. he slapped it under his arm as he rode
    his tricycle up and down in front of the house, where i could monitor him through
    the kitchen window. one day i saw a rather disagreeable neighbor woman bend over
    and say something to him, which caused him to run to our front door. when i opened
    it, he asked, "mommy, am i a little boy or a little girl?" of course, i told him
    that he was a little boy, and since (even at 2 1/2) he spoke very clearly, i told
    him what to say if this neighbor-or anyone else-asked him about his doll. this
    same neighbor asked my son why he had a doll. i saw her startled face when he
    looked up at her with his big blue eyes and said clearly, "i''m developing my
    paternal instincts!" incidentally, abby, both my sons have become wonderful fathers.

    the letter in your column containing a "naughty" poem someone had written in a

    in 1885.) the handwriting, although that of an adolescent, was beautifully penned,
    with a lot of flourishes and squiggles to decorate it. this particular book had
    apparently been used to pass signals between students. some were in poetry. a
    most entertaining example follows: "when you and i our love shall part "shall
    leave a blot in both our hearts "i to the silent grave shall go, and "sleep my
    last as others do. "all this, my love, i want to say, but "night doth call, and
    i obey. "with meditation read these lines; "you will in them a question find.
    "sweet is the question; mind it well. "heart to heart, so fare thee well!" in
    the margin is written, "read the first word of every line going down; it poses
    the question: `when shall i sleep all night with you, sweetheart?'' " someone
    else wrote, "some said he would before many nights." and in yet another hand was

    dogs are fine; i have nothing against them. but should people sleep with them?
    i was a widow when i married a widower who has two small dogs, and abby, they
    sleep with him in his bed every night. he says he and his first wife always let
    the dogs sleep with them. i just can''t seem to get used to this. don''t get me
    wrong, i like dogs-but i don''t like having them in my bed. during the night,
    the dogs walk on us (my husband sleeps right through it, but i can''t). if i put
    them out and close our door, they cry and scratch on the door until he lets them
    in. irritated'

    how rude and ignorant can people be? my daughter was married 10 days ago. despite
    the fact that both sets of parents are divorced, everyone got along (as it should
    be) and had a wonderful time. my complaint concerns "no-shows"-people who rsvp''d
    in the affirmative and failed to appear. we had the reception at a nice hotel,
    and limited our guest list to the number of people we could afford to have. we
    made individual favors for each person, and went to a great deal of trouble and
    expense to make this day one my daughter and her new husband would remember forever.
    abby, a full one-quarter of the confirmed guests did not show up! don''t people
    realize that we had to provide the hotel with a guaranteed number of guests two
    days before the reception, and had to pay for them regardless? if these people
    had bothered to call and let us know their plans had changed, we could have saved
    $400. abby, please tell your readers to seriously consider their plans before
    responding to an rsvp, and if circumstances change after accepting, to at least
    give the concerned party the courtesy of a telephone call as soon as possible.
    please use my name. i am so angry with these people, maybe they will see this
    letter and know how much hurt they have caused by their lack of common courtesy.

    i found an abandoned photo album in a mountain of junk that a disgruntled tenant
    left for us to clean up in a victorian mansion near downtown los angeles. the
    tenant was a notorious scavenger and, as such, went through people''s trash (literally).
    most of the stuff was worthless, but at least one item could be priceless. it
    is a photograph album containing photos from the late ''30s through the ''50s.
    it apparently had belonged to a japanese couple whose last name was "tsunekawa."
    in this album are photographs of (presumably) the tsunekawas and fellow japanese

    i know your column is for people who have problems, but i''m hoping you will make
    room for my letter. recently, i had four migraine headaches in six weeks. they
    were so severe that they caused temporary blindness, numbness, paralysis and loss
    of speech. i spent a total of 2 1/2 weeks in bed. my doctor gave me a list of
    foods to avoid. this list was two pages long! at first, i was uncomfortable with
    some of the restrictions because it meant that i had to cook everything from scratch.
    then i discovered baby food! it is portable, convenient, and has no chemical additives
    or flavorings. it''s not just plain old squash or peas. why am i telling you this?
    it occurred to me that you could spread the word to the thousands of people who
    for various reasons are on restricted diets for one of the following reasons:
    have diabetes or hypoglycemia and must eat small meals frequently; have chemical-additive
    sensitivities (no msg or hvp); have trouble swallowing (the smooth texture is
    helpful); are recovering from mouth surgery and can''t chew yet; or have recently
    tightened orthodontic appliances and can''t put pressure on their teeth. in case
    you''re wondering, i do not work for a baby food manufacturer. i am a schoolteacher
    who just wants to help. i wish someone had given me this tip years ago. i would
    have been spared the severe pain i recently experienced. so, will you speak up
    for me? thanks a million. sandy rodgers, irvine, calif.'

    immediately, where they continued to watch me from behind their curtains. abby,
    i am by no means paranoid, but my older sister moved in with me a few months ago,
    and it''s making her crazy. some new neighbors are also aware of that nosy couple,
    and several of my friends have been stared at and have made comments about my
    "curious" neighbors. we have tried ignoring them, and a couple of times my sister
    stared back at them. any suggestions? under observation in nashville'

    i am writing to you about a family problem. my grandmother just got married again.
    grandpa died 12 years ago, and grandma has lived with us ever since. (grandma
    owns the house, but my dad did all the remodeling, keeps it up, so it''s really
    more like ours.) anyway, all those years, grandma said she didn''t need a man;
    but all of a sudden, she found this guy and everything changed. she''s happy and
    just like a kid again. her new husband moved into our house and is sharing grandma''s
    room. he claims he has heart trouble, so all he does is eat, sleep and watch tv.
    meanwhile, grandma waits on him like he''s a king. he loves her desserts, so now
    grandma spends her time cooking and baking, which is the only good part because
    the rest of the family is getting lots of good eats now. she used to mend and
    iron our clothes and even clean our rooms, but not anymore! both my mom and dad
    work, so we kids are left with the housework to do after school. i am sorry grandma
    ever found this lazy old fool. why don''t old people who are nearly 60 settle
    down to being alone instead of wanting to be young again? downhearted and overworked'

    i am a single, mature young woman who met a middle-aged bachelor. within a month,

    we wait a while before making any commitments. he kept telling me he couldn''t
    live without me and had to have my answer, so i told him i wanted to go away for
    a week to think things over. (i went to my sister''s 300 miles away for a vacation.)
    well, you''ve heard the old saying, "absence makes the heart grow fonder." it
    must have worked, because i really missed him and, when i got home, i told him
    i had decided to marry him. then he told me he wanted a week to think it over.
    after the week was up, he asked for another week. i was hurt but gave him another
    week. now he tells me he is still not sure and wants a little more time to make
    up his mind! do you think he is pulling my leg or trying to get even with me?

    apparent annoyance with this new arrangement has become obvious, and that is my
    problem. it is very depressing to be asked the first thing in the morning, "what
    is your schedule today?" (what she means is, "are you going to stay home all day

    in the morning and nap in the afternoon, and this displeases my spouse no end.
    i figure that this will keep me in good physical condition and possibly increase
    the number of years i will be around, which i suspect may be another source of

    told me to let my husband have his flings and have a ball, and in time he will
    get tired of it and come back to me. in the meantime, i should be pleasant and
    uncomplaining and be a good mother to our two teen-agers. my problem: how can
    i endure the pain of seeing him come and go as he pleases? can you give me a few
    pointers on how to put up with this when my heart is aching? lonely'

    i am writing to you because i am terribly frustrated and am too ashamed to talk
    to anyone else about the problem. i am married to a basically wonderful guy, except
    for one problem. he is totally uninterested in sex. he''s 28, handsome and in
    apparent good health, so don''t tell me to send him to a doctor. he loathes them.
    he is very intelligent, has a ph.d. in history and his work is his life. he says
    people who are interested in sex are insecure and so intellectually dead that
    sex is all they have left. he always has an excuse for avoiding it. he''s either
    too tired, it''s too late or he''s too preoccupied with something he''s reading.
    i am 27 and i won several beauty contests in college. i''m cheerful, educated,
    mentally and physically healthy, and all i want is a decent sex life. i''ve tried
    all the gimmicks: sexy nightgowns, discussing it with him, leaving good books
    and magazine articles around for him to see. even crying. nothing helps. we have
    one child (a miracle), and my husband didn''t come near me for six months after
    that. i feel rejected. i''ve considered having an affair, but i''d feel too guilty
    to enjoy it. i don''t want to divorce him because outside of this one failing,
    i love him. how can i turn him on? abandoned in bed in philadelphia'

    we live on a corner lot. the front yard is not fenced, so the kids and dogs cut
    across the corner. the kids i can yell at-the dogs i can just clean up after.
    (we don''t even own a dog.) the most recent aggravation came, however, with the
    ripening of the apples on the tree which is between the house and the sidewalk.
    neighborhood kids come by, pick an apple-or an armful-take a few bites, and throw
    the cores in my yard or on the sidewalk. the other day, two young girls walked
    by my house with armloads of apples. they glanced in my window and saw that i
    saw them. i came out on the porch to tell them once again that i did not want
    them picking apples off my tree, but they ran off, denying that the apples were
    from my tree! while they were running, i asked them loudly why they were running
    like guilty little thieves. my dilemma: i do not mind children picking my apples,
    but i think they should ask first. there are more than enough apples. if they
    want enough for a pie, i''d give them a bag in which to carry them. so now i feel
    like the neighborhood witch because i don''t let the kids pick my apples. i still
    think if they don''t ask first, it''s stealing. am i right or wrong? apple annie

    in response to the letter from "mother of the bride," marsha and brad seem like
    normal young adults, trying to live, love and marry according to god''s law. their
    condemnation by her mother is tragic, unwarranted and undeserved. it''s interesting
    that after all her self-righteous babble, she was too ashamed to sign her name.
    i am a staunch roman catholic-educated by the jesuits throughout high school and
    college-and i can tell her with certainty that most of the jesuits who taught
    me would condemn her profoundly. in this entire premarital mess, the mother is
    the only sinner. her only obligation in this matter is to stand by her daughter,
    and support her psychologically and in every way possible. in 20 years, when she
    goes to visit her daughter and her family, and they throw her out, she''ll ask,
    "what did i do wrong?" i speak with authority; i was there. in 1960, my wife and
    i married in the face of considerable opposition. betty was a superb wife and
    mother. she raised three beautiful children, but we could never forget the cloud
    that hung over what should have been one of the happiest days of our lives. betty
    died three years ago, during the 31st year of a wonderful marriage. for god''s
    sake, mother, help your daughter, please ! leonard j. de carlo, m.d., oklahoma

    what advice would you give "gwen," my 48-year-old daughter, who is going with
    a divorced man whose two teenagers hate him? as small children, he tickled them
    until they cried, swung them around by their ankles until they cried, and when
    they wouldn''t stop crying at bedtime, he''d press on their chests with his arm
    (wrist to elbow) with all his might until they stopped crying. this information

    when i saw the letter in your column about someone getting locked in the trunk
    of an automobile, i had to write. i am now 15, but when i was 5, my best friend,
    marshall, and i were playing in my mom''s car. we got in the backseat, pushed
    the little button, pulled the rear seats forward, and crawled into the trunk.
    after pulling the backseat up, marshall would display his manly strength by kicking
    the seat back down. he did it several times, showing off for me. after a while,
    you guessed it: marshall couldn''t get the seat down, and we were locked in the
    trunk. we both tried kicking the seat down, which didn''t work. then we tried
    pushing the trunk lid up, which was also ineffective. by that time, we were panting
    for breath and clammy with sweat. a little while later, mom came down the stairway
    to the garage calling for us. (when you don''t see two 5-year-olds for a while,
    you get suspicious.) i yelled to mom that we were in the trunk of the car, and
    after repeating, "in the trunk?" in amazement, she ran and got the keys to the
    trunk and released us from our ovenlike dungeon. i later realized that if mom
    hadn''t rescued us, we would have suffocated. if there had been a latch to the
    trunk so that it could have been opened from the inside, marshall and i would
    have found it and escaped much sooner. jennifer prowse, guam'

    i think my son''s wedding must be in the running for some kind of "ruined wedding"
    prize. his wedding took place on a cruise ship, so everyone was together for 10
    days. two days before the wedding, one of the bridesmaids was "flashed" by a crew
    member and came unglued. it was the talk of the passengers, but the captain refused
    to take it seriously. from then on, everything went downhill. can anyone top this?

    i work as a cashier in a small grocery store, and have some advice i would like
    you to pass on to all shoppers: could they take a few minutes of their time to
    put their name, address and phone number in their discount coupon packs? we are
    forever finding them and have no way of returning them to their owners. just yesterday
    we found one that had an envelope in it with a lot of money. it also contained
    pictures of grandchildren. it was the pictures that the woman remembered, and
    came back to the store to retrieve. she had forgotten that her money was also
    in the pack. even if there weren''t money and/or pictures enclosed, the coupons
    are valuable, and we would like to be able to return them. thanks for getting
    the word out. mary, a cashier at blouin''s iga, swanton, vt.'

    i''m a faithful dear abby reader and usually agree with your answers, but your
    response to the feminist who complained about men treating her to drinks in bars
    and then behaving as if they expected "something" in return upset me. you said
    that if she really wanted to promote equality between the sexes, the next time
    she struck up a conversation with a guy in a bar, she should buy the drinks. then
    she wouldn''t owe him anything! since when does accepting a couple of drinks in
    a bar create a debt possibly to be repaid in prostitution? you were off base with
    the feminist, who rightly assumed that the gift of a couple of drinks was politely
    discharged by the pleasure of her company. when women earn a dollar for every
    dollar men make, i''ll advocate going dutch on every outing. in the meantime,
    i say that dates-even those encountered in bars, and this goes for either gender-owe
    the purchaser nothing except a sincere thank-you. in a survey a few years ago,
    young men were asked whether they thought they could expect sex if they spent
    money on their dates. the more they spent, the more likely they were to say that
    sex was expected! to go along with that, which you imply you do by agreeing that
    the only way she wouldn''t "owe" him something would be to buy her own drinks,
    is to say that dating is a form of prostitution. please reconsider your answer.

    a remarried widow wrote complaining about sleeping with her husband''s two dogs,

    a year and a half ago, my daughter (i''ll call her betty) was married in a beautiful

    for people who go through windshields and red lights. for somebody with leukemia.
    for people being operated on. for barefoot kids who aren''t careful. for people
    who are into feudin'' and fightin''. for hemophiliacs and daredevils. for people
    undergoing dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant. for people who fool
    around with guns. for little kids who manage to uncap a bottle of something poisonous.
    a blood donor is good for people who have been badly burned. for new mothers who
    need transfusions. for new babies who need a complete change of blood supply.
    for people having open-heart surgery. for cancer patients. for people with severe
    hepatitis and anemia. for kids who fall out of trees or whatever. a blood donor

    you recently told "fighting in connecticut" that her family is unusual because
    she is a democrat and her husband is a registered republican. well, my husband
    and i are in the same boat. not only that, my mother was a staunch nixon supporter,
    and my father a gung-ho kennedy man from new hampshire. up until she died, my
    mother wore her "i married a damned democrat" button to the polls, and my father
    wore his "i married a damned republican" button. because of our differences, our
    two daughters get to hear both sides of nearly every issue; we tolerate each other''s
    differences, and have learned the fine art of compromise. this protestant converted
    to catholicism so we could all worship together. my traditional husband now understands
    the issues of homosexuality better and has given up eating veal. i have learned
    to be responsible for my own checkbook, quit smoking, discovered the music of
    tony bennett and michael feinstein, and have learned to keep my mouth shut. some
    people think we are a crazy couple, but our 15-year-old happy marriage is built
    on tolerance of our differences, and the integrity to stand up for what we believe
    in. neither of us will probably ever change our stance on abortion or era, but
    we never attack each other personally. sign me . . . tolerant in new jersey p.s.

    recently, my husband and i moved to my husband''s homeland to be with his mother
    who has been diagnosed with emphysema and deteriorating lungs. last march, the
    doctor''s prognosis was that she would die within a matter of months. our problem
    is that she is still smoking cigarettes and is not using her oxygen as often as
    she should. she is constantly wheezing and short of breath. her doctor told her
    to quit her job, so now she''s home all day, and all she talks about is dying.
    abby, if she is so worried about dying, why is she still smoking? i feel like
    i''m hitting my head against a brick wall whenever i try to talk to her and give
    her words of encouragement. she refuses to go to another doctor for a second opinion.
    abby, what can the family and i do to help her see the light? concerned daughter-in-law'

    nine months ago, my husband of 23 years died unexpectedly. although most of my
    friends have been very helpful, i was appalled by the behavior of many of my acquaintances.
    they actively avoided me for about six months. after that, they acted as if nothing
    had happened. i know these people are not purposely cruel. they just didn''t know
    what to say, and now they are afraid to "remind" me of my loss. a simple "i''m
    so sorry," is all i want to hear-and believe me, the loss is with me all the time.
    sometimes i get the impression someone does not know my husband has died, so i
    tell him or her, only to hear, "oh, yeah, i read about that." the best thing i
    have ever done is join the widowed persons service sponsored by the aarp and local
    community organizations. i also joined a bereavement group sponsored by hospice.
    only other widowed people know how i feel and take my feelings seriously. the
    following appeared in a recent w.p.s. newsletter. i hope you think it is worth
    printing: after someone has died, say . . . "what i always liked about ( ) was
    ( )." "i''ll never forget the time he and i ( )." "may i take the kids to the
    beach today?" "it''s ok. tell me again about ( )." "i just phoned to say hello."
    "tuesday will be a tough day for you. may we spend it together?" "i thought you
    might need a hug, or someone to hold your hand today." "you don''t have to hide
    your tears." "i''d love to (trim bushes, etc.). may i do it for you?" the best
    thing anybody (who did not know my husband personally) said to me was, "i was
    so sorry to read about your husband''s death. would you like to talk about it?"

    i find collecting money for gifts in the workplace a huge pain. i think that practice
    should be outlawed-especially in places where six or more people are employed.
    i work in a large office-there are 52 people here. many of them i hardly know
    because we meet only during the breaks-or in the bathroom. why should i be expected
    to chip in for gifts for people who are practically strangers to me? i suggested
    that we hold one party a month for newlyweds, babies, birthdays, etc. no dice.
    like lemmings, they continue to give, then complain about it. i think it''s high
    time we put an end to such foolishness. what do you-and your readers-have to say
    about these "collections"? sane in san diego'

    she usually got a bad cold about the second week in october. so, it seemed, did
    a lot of other people. she wasn''t sure where this one came from. a type-a businessman
    had been coughing on his laptop and the rest of the commuter train car. the supermarket
    checker had paused to blow her nose on a soggy tissue before pushing the groceries
    over the scanner. the hostess at a weekend party had been hoarse and sneezing.
    as usual, she was surprised all over again how miserable a cold made her feel.
    she had a sore throat, a stuffy nose, a headache, a dragged-out feeling. why,
    she thought with irritation, don''t people who have colds stay home and away from
    others, so they don''t pass the virus on? as usual, though, she soldiered on with
    her cold, juggling the complicated commitments of her life even though she would
    have liked to cuddle up with a comforter and a cup of tea and watch the simpson
    hearings on tv. she made it through her scheduled presentation at a business meeting,
    tucking cough drops into her cheeks to control her coughing. none of the people
    who shook her hand afterwards mentioned her cold. her husband, being helpful,
    took the family out for dinner. she covered her mouth when she began sneezing
    at the salad bar, but used the same hand on the serving tongs as she filled her
    plate. back home, she took a 12-hour cold capsule, frosted cupcakes for the cub
    scouts and went to bed feeling lousy but virtuous. an assistant manager at the
    meeting caught the cold and passed it on to the flight attendant with whom he
    shared a bed and a passion for the electric slide. she worked a full 737 flight
    to atlanta and another to los angeles before she could schedule a few days off.
    the los angeles passenger in seat 13c was feeling miserable three days later.
    but he''d paid $1,000 to attend a reception for a political candidate he supported
    and nothing short of a 104-degree fever would have kept him away. the candidate
    caught the cold and passed it around the state as he shook innumerable hands and
    hugged a few dozen babies. the candidate''s political strategist got sick, but
    he had other campaigns to advise, more funds to raise, other political stories
    to spin to the media. he gave the cold to two people on the washington-bound plane,
    to three political volunteers, to a senior official at the white house and to
    a reporter who was asking tough questions about a client whose numbers were slipping.
    the white house official gave the cold to two secretaries, an intern, "a source
    close to the president" and a trade representative from a third-world country,
    who took the cold home along with the promise of more economic aid. the reporter
    couldn''t take time off just for a cold. she was putting together a big story
    and she needed to save her sick days for the times her preschooler was ill. but
    she had to give up when the day-care center called her to pick up her feverish
    daughter and her back-up sitter couldn''t make it. after the little girl had been
    up most of the night crying with an earache, the reporter took her to the pediatrician.
    one or the other of them gave the cold to a toddler and his pregnant mother in
    the doctor''s office. seven other preschoolers were absent from day care the next
    week. the father of one of the preschoolers caught the cold when he took his turn
    giving her a bath and a bedtime story. he was a banker who couldn''t be spared
    from work, so he spent several days passing out colds along with the mortgage
    and loan papers his clients signed. the cold also spread to a trust officer at
    the bank whose daughter was getting married on saturday. the father of the bride
    not only handed his daughter to the groom, but his cold as well. four of the women
    who kissed him at the reception got the cold in return. one of the wedding guests
    took the cold with her to a crucial job interview and gave it to the prospective
    employer along with her resume; with her gravelly voice and runny nose, she did
    not make a good impression. the interviewer had the cold when he went to a retirement
    home to celebrate his mother''s 85th birthday; it would have been unthinkable
    to have missed the party. only two of the other elderly residents became seriously
    ill, but both recovered. from the retirement home, the cold spread around the
    locker room of a professional football team via the coach who spent an afternoon
    helping his elderly mother fill out business papers that couldn''t wait. no one
    on the team was really sick, but the cold took the edge off the performance of
    the first-string quarterback and the best punt returner and the team lost a game
    it had been expected to win. apparently no one died from the cold as it spread
    around the country. no one knows whether the temporary hearing problems of any
    of the toddlers became chronic or if any of the elderly did not return to their
    old vigor. no one knows how many business mistakes were made or golden opportunities
    lost by people not feeling quite up to par but not quite sick enough to stay home.
    no one wears lapel ribbons to call attention to colds. or holds protest marches
    to demand more research money. or sets up private associations to seek a cure.
    no one even writes to ann landers or dear abby or miss manners suggesting it is
    rude and wrong to expose others to our viruses, however unintentionally, or to
    pass along an illness, however mild. so stock up with cough drops. it''s the second
    week of october again.'

    well. we have always tried to treat our children equally, and our estates will

    i have kept the column you had regarding the elderly woman who was hooked on sweepstakes.
    i am sure that most people don''t realize how serious the problem is. i am an
    attorney in the field of real estate and elder law, and not a week goes by that
    i do not get a call from an older person who needs to speak to me privately. (they
    are afraid someone will listen in on the phone, so i usually make a house call.)
    one 83-year-old woman had just built a two-car garage onto her home to accommodate
    the new jaguar she was told she had won. (it turns out she was only a "finalist"-and
    she never received the car.) another woman had three shopping bags full of canceled
    checks she had sent to various agencies to "win" some kind of contest. in two
    years, she had spent more than $175,000. all her checks were for $3 and $5. when
    she could no longer afford to have people come in and help her with her daily
    chores, she had to give up her home and now lives in a community-supported senior
    citizens residence. another dear soul had her entire house, from floor to ceiling,
    stacked with magazines to which she had subscribed. she asked, "couldn''t i have
    them send the magazines to someone else and i''ll send the money? they have been
    so good to me." i don''t know what can be done in other states, but in florida,
    we have a system where a "guardian" can be set up. elderly persons can be allowed
    to reside at home, and either family members or professional guardians can manage
    their money. abby, sweepstakes are not simply a harmless pleasure. they can get
    to be a real compulsion. maria l. drumm, attorney, ft. myers, fla.'

    the letter signed "lost and lonely," from the widow whose children cleaned out

    your answer really surprised me. you said the daughters spared her a "painfully
    heartbreaking task"-wrong! they denied her the chance to heal! sorting his belongings
    gives her a last chance to review old memories-or catch a whiff of his cologne
    on a suit coat, and choose who would most appreciate something which was his.
