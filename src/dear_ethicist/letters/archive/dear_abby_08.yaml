    my 7-year-old son, when told he was adopted, asked the inevitable question: "then,
    mamma, does that mean you''re not my real mother?" "well, let''s see," i said.
    "here, pinch me real hard and we''ll see if i''m real or not." he pinched, i squealed,
    and we both had a good laugh. a happy, frank discussion followed. but the most
    wonderful part is that this precious son of mine has two mothers. i have had the
    privilege of rocking him, feeding him and watching him grow into an adorable 7-year-old.
    yes, i am his "real" mother and don''t you dare call me less. but no less real
    is the little girl who refused to have an abortion, insisting, "this little life
    inside me has as much right to live as i." the little girl who looked the social
    worker in the eye and said, "this adoption will work, because i am doing it for
    his sake, and i don''t ever intend to hurt him by interfering with his life."
    that brave little girl has been true to her word for seven years. someday when
    he is grown to a big, strapping 6-footer, if his appearance in her life would
    not hurt the children she is now bearing for herself, i should be happy to think
    that i had so taught him to love and respect the thought of her that he would
    take her in his big arms and whisper, "mother, i love you." she has every right
    to his love. and he will be a better man if he proves wise enough to know it.

    fools rush in! in second-guessing shakespeare, you should not be so quick to give
    credence to a high school student''s english teacher. most serious shakespeare
    scholars now agree that, in "hamlet," "nunnery" means a convent or cloister. it
    was not until 1936 that dover wilson, in his "what happens in hamlet," first suggested
    that it meant a brothel, along with other silly notions, most of them freudian.
    such interpretation became fashionable for a while (laurence olivier gave it acceptability)
    but it has largely faded. although there was some use of the word "nunnery" in
    elizabethan england as a brothel, such use was not extant. no one can rationally
    read this scene without concluding that hamlet, in urging ophelia thither, is
    crudely suggesting that only in such a place can she hope to escape the evil machinations
    of man and the vile institution of marriage, which has so despoiled his mother.
    he can hardly have meant brothel to this end. isaac asimov, in adopting the conventional
    meaning, offers another suggestion: "but is it ophelia he plans to send to a nunnery,
    or is it his mother, queen gertrude?" be assured that, for every opinion of shakespeare,
    there is another to the opposite, and hundreds in between. and just because this
    genius was much given to the bawdy does not mean we should go out of our way to
    give his every word that twist. will baker, yakima, wash.'

    years ago, you had a piece in your column about "children''s little hands"-i can''t
    remember all of it, but it contained some wonderful advice for parents who are
    raising small children. it said, "never remake a bed after a child has done his
    best to make it-no matter how bad the job is." i just loved that piece, but i
    can''t find it anywhere. will you please run it again? it was one of your best.

    you were absolutely and positively wrong in your advice to "mother of six"! i''ve
    used such strong language because this goof is monumental; you owe 50 mea culpas
    on this one. what if i don''t like something i read in your column? should i write
    to the publisher of my newspaper and tell him to cancel my subscription? or should
    i contact the newspaper''s largest advertisers and enlist their aid in coercing
    the editors to print only what i deem appropriate? soon we would have either no
    media or only meaningless fluff, offensive to no one. also, no dear abby. let
    me tell you what offends me: i am offended by this growing idea that we can control
    what people (media included) say by simply labeling it "offensive." freedom of
    speech is our first and foremost civil right, guaranteed by the u.s. constitution.
    you don''t like what someone says? tough. don''t look, don''t listen or don''t
    read it. but don''t try to shut them up. information isn''t dangerous. suppression
    of information is. very little tv programming is intended for 4-year-olds. they
    don''t have jobs, and they don''t spend money. i couldn''t believe you would encourage
    economic coercion nationwide as a means of censorship to help one parent abrogate
    her responsibility. but don''t shut up. just think a little. and keep on writing.

    so "slim and satisfied" thinks no one would tell an obese person, "gee, you''re
    fat! why don''t you go on a diet?" well, it''s happened to me dozens of times.
    total strangers have stopped me on the street and said, "you have such a pretty
    face, have you ever tried-(weight watchers, optifast, nutri-system, overeaters
    anonymous, tops, diet center, jenny craig, hypnosis, or that wonderful doctor
    who does stomach-stapling surgery)?" i''ve had people come up to me in restaurants
    and say, "do you really think you should be eating that?" (the "that" could be
    anything from a salad to dessert; they don''t think a fat person should be eating
    anything, period.) hairdressers and makeup specialists have told me that it''s
    pointless to bother about my hair or makeup, weighing as much as i do. and buying
    clothes is a nightmare. i either order mine by mail or have them made by a seamstress.
    if i enter a clothing store to buy a gift for someone, a salesperson is sure to
    approach me and say, "sorry, we don''t carry your size here." i broke my arm in
    a car accident two years ago, and while waiting in the emergency room, a doctor
    appeared and said, "boy, you really should lose some weight!" as if my weight
    had caused my broken arm! most physicians believe that all fat people are lazy,
    weak-willed and undisciplined, rather than people who could be suffering from
    a genetic or metabolic problem. i am 36 years old, and have been on more diets
    than i can count. a pediatrician put me on metrecal when i was 8; another doctor
    gave me a 600-calorie-per-day diet when i was 11; still another put me in the
    hospital for a medically supervised fast when i was 13. for the past year, i''ve
    been working with a great counselor who understands obesity. she has helped me
    more than all the diet doctors and weight-loss groups combined. i am learning
    to understand the connection between eating and hunger, which was lost in all
    those years of bingeing and dieting. i know i''ll never be thin because i''m genetically
    programmed to be fat-but i hope to find my natural weight through a program of
    learning to eat from hunger. i hate exercising, but i do it every day, because
    i know it''s important (for both fat and thin people) for health reasons. abby,
    you''ve done a terrific job in educating the public about obesity and discrimination
    against fat people. you have helped fat people stop hating themselves and to understand
    that they have a physical problem-not a lack of willpower. i know this is too
    long for your column and you''ll have to trim it, but please try to print some
    of it. i speak for so many people. looking beyond looks'

    i need your help concerning something that happened to me many years ago. i am
    now 23 and have a good memory. the trouble started when i was about 3 or 4 years
    old. my grandfather would pick me up and put me on his lap; then after a while,
    he would put his hand under my dress and rub me in a private place. with a little
    girl''s mind, and because i was so fond of him, i never thought he would do anything
    wrong. i would tolerate it as long as i could, then i''d get down. this went on
    until i was about 7. i remember trying to stay off his lap because it made me
    feel uncomfortable and ashamed. when i was 10, my grandfather died. i kept remembering
    what he had done to me, and i couldn''t bring myself to feel sad. meanwhile, my
    mother loved her father very much and cried for a long time every time his name
    was mentioned. once she asked me if i ever thought of grandpa and if i missed
    him. that really got to me, abby, because i remember what a terrible thing he
    did to me, and i was glad i didn''t have to sit on his lap. should i tell my mother
    what happened and destroy the good memories she has of her father, or keep it
    to myself since he is now dead? he doesn''t deserve to be well thought of after
    violating my body as a child, but i don''t want to hurt my mother. what should
    i do? bitter memories'

    which lingerie was displayed. after checking thoroughly with various customers
    who were in the store that day, we traced the dentures to a lady from san francisco
    who was visiting friends in hoquiam. we were able to obtain her address, so we
    wrote to her asking if she had left her dentures in our store. she answered immediately,
    asking us to please send the dentures at once as she was having difficulty eating
    and talking. we carefully wrapped the dentures, marked the package "fragile,"
    insured it and mailed it promptly to the lady in san francisco. abby, she never
    acknowledged that she had received her dentures, let alone thanked us for having
    sent them. reimbursement for the postage and insurance was incidental, but we
    did expect a note of thanks. my question: was it our duty to take our time and

    "leona," my unmarried granddaughter who is graduating from high school, just found
    out she is pregnant. her mother, who is divorced, wants leona to keep the baby.
    i am urging her to put the baby up for adoption. leona and her mother don''t even
    want to let the baby''s father know about the pregnancy for fear he may want custody
    rights-never mind that he should be held financially responsible for his actions.
    my daughter (leona''s mother) works only part time and receives meager child support
    for her other three children. i''ve pointed out that it will be impossible for
    them to make it financially. i''ve also pointed out that leona''s chances of going
    to college and ever getting married with a ready-made family will drop drastically.
    in short, i''ve told them that leona, a beautiful girl who once had a promising
    future, is almost certainly doomed to a life of poverty and unhappiness if she
    keeps the baby. abby, what is your opinion of this unreasonable attitude on their
    part? concerned grandfather'

    i read in the chicago tribune that a judge had ordered a drug dealer to pay for
    his keep while he served his time in jail, so i wrote the following letter to
    the editor: "why not a crime tax, or `housing'' fee? each criminal sentenced to
    serve time in jail should be assessed a housing fee. this would put the financial
    burden where it belongs-on the criminal. "cook county currently pays the salvation
    army $1.7 million to provide 140 beds a year for its `surplus'' inmates. this
    figures out to $33.27 per day, per person. if the county collected $33 per day
    from each resident, it would cost a dope pusher or drunk driver $900 per month
    for lodging, goods, clothes and medical expenses. by comparison, a crime victim
    has to pay that much for only two days'' room and board in an average hospital.
    "cook county jail now has more than 5,000 inmates. at $33 per day, the residence
    fee would generate more than $60 million in revenue per year." is my theory sound?

    thank you for telling your 90 million readers last september about the midland
    community spirit award, created to honor annually a community that best represents
    the american ideal of a community pulling together and helping one another. also,
    thank you for joining us at the white house last november to honor the citizens
    of sioux city, iowa, who won the award for their compassionate assistance to the
    passengers and crew of united flight 232 after it crashed into an iowa cornfield.
    among the 88 communities nominated last year were many inspiring stories of community
    spirit. as one of the judges said, "it was difficult to select a winner, since
    through their efforts, all were winners." for example: - when a building collapsed
    in brownsville, texas, citizens worked shoulder to shoulder for more than 60 hours,
    relentlessly clearing rubble to find those who died and rescuing trapped survivors.
    - when a train derailed near saco and glascow, mont., the citizens of these two
    small towns graciously fed, clothed and cared for the waylaid passengers. - when
    a blizzard halted traffic late one afternoon, members of the valley view methodist
    church in north texas walked from car to car inviting hundreds of stranded motorists
    to spend the night in their church. and townspeople brought whatever they had
    in their freezers to feed all of them. - when colonial beach, va., (population
    2,500) needed to replace the old school built in 1912, the community raised half
    a million dollars to build a new school through bingo, bake sales and penny campaigns.
    we are now seeking nominations for the midland community spirit award to be presented
    in october 1990. we have asked president bush to make the presentation again at
    a white house ceremony. abby, won''t you please ask proud citizens to nominate
    their communities now? thank you for your help. carrol m. thomas, mayor, midland,

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    one day last fall in the azalea garden in philadelphia''s fairmount park, i spotted
    a young woman wearing a short poufy white dress and carrying a bouquet. a bride,
    i figured: even out of season the azalea garden is a popular spot for wedding
    photos. but, a few minutes later, i saw another young woman in the same poufy
    white dress. a double wedding? then a turn in the path revealed the whole wedding
    party having its picture taken: five or six women in the short poufy white dresses,
    assorted tuxedoed groomsmen and, posed regally beside the groom, the bride herself,
    dressed from head to toe in black lace. such is the power of conventional color
    symbolism that it gave me an actual chill. black-and-white weddings were fashionable
    last year, but still . . . a wedding dress that looks exactly like widows'' weeds
    sends, as they say, the wrong message. the rule that brides wear white-or occasionally
    cream or ivory or even blush-pink-seems written in stone, beyond all questioning,
    as right, proper and necessary as the rule that baby boys are dressed in blue
    and baby girls in pink. in fact, according to jo paoletti, a costume historian
    at the university of maryland, both rules are relatively new. as recently as 1918,
    a children''s wear trade paper advised that baby boys should wear pink and girls
    blue: "the reason is that pink being a more decided and stronger color is more
    suitable for the boy; while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier
    for the girl." a century or two ago, a bride who wore black wouldn''t necessarily
    have given anybody the creeps, or even raised eyebrows. a typical bride then got
    married in the best dress she owned, no matter what color it was. even a bride
    who could afford a new dress for her wedding would usually expect it to become
    her new best dress, and would choose its color based on her taste and the fashion
    of the moment. but once the idea of white wedding gowns began to catch on, it
    took hold with a vengeance. at the turn of the century, "the idea of white for
    purity took precedence," according to the wedding etiquette book by the editors
    of bride''s magazine, with the whiteness of wedding gowns symbolizing the untouched
    innocence of the blushing virgin bride. emily post, in the 1940 edition of "etiquette,"
    advised that a widow who marries "cannot wear a bridal veil, orange blossoms,
    nor a myrtle wreath, which are emblems of virginity. . . . although she usually
    chooses a dress and hat of color, she may, especially if she is still very young,
    wear an all-white dress-without a train-and with a hat, of course, instead of
    a bridal veil." post expressed no opinion on what a divorcee should wear for her
    second wedding but, since she thought "sending out engraved invitations to, or
    announcements of, the remarriage of a divorcee is in questionable taste," she
    probably would''ve found a white wedding gown, a veil and bridesmaids unthinkable.
    things have loosened up considerably since then. a 1988 bride''s magazine survey
    found that only 14 percent of bride''s readers expected to be virgins on their
    wedding night. along the way, there was an interesting transition phase when some
    people considered the rules to have been repealed while others considered them
    still in force, with the result that scandalized ladies were always writing to
    dear abby wanting to know if so-and-so was really allowed to have a big church
    wedding with a white dress and a veil and bridesmaids when everybody knew she
    was no more a virgin than her own mother-and did they have to send the hussy a
    present? now brides of all ages and conditions wear white if they feel like it,
    and it isn''t even big news if the bride is pregnant. on some other planet it
    might have turned out that, once the virginal symbolism of white weddings fell
    apart, brides would have started wearing some other color. but so wedded are we
    to white for weddings that, instead, we''ve kept the color and dumped the symbolism.
    but, now that it doesn''t mean the woman wearing it is a virgin anymore, what
    does a white wedding dress mean? "now," jo paoletti says, "it just symbolizes
    being a bride." illustration photo'

    stamps don''t stick? wet the stamp but don''t dog-lick all the glue off. touch
    the stamp to a wet sponge. if possible, buy stamps in coils of 100 or more; they''re
    made for machine applications and have more (and better) glue. also, they haven''t
    been touched by the hands of the many inventory employees at the post office.
    another tip. it''s better to lick the envelope, not the stamp. believe it or not,
    the envelope is usually cleaner than the stamp. no glue at all on these stamps?
    cockroaches ate it all off in the drawer. honest. it happens all the time. they
    leave no tracks. print more letters about the poor quality of glue. it didn''t

    can you stand one more letter of complaint about hairdressers? i quit going to

    why? because she kept stopping her work to use her hands to gesture while she
    talked to me. that was bad enough, but while she talked and gestured, she kept
    looking at herself in the mirror! that used to drive me crazy. i don''t have time
    to waste while she "talks to herself" in the mirror, as i have to get back to

    i thought, "hooray, now we don''t have to sneak around anymore." wrong! he still
    says it''s not wise for us to be seen together in public. why? he''s not married
    anymore. abby, i can''t understand this. he doesn''t give me a reason; he says,
    "it''s better if we''re not seen together in public." when i mention marriage,

    why do the news media report that someone is "elderly," when age has absolutely

    woman." abby, are elderly people different or less valued than other humans? elderly

    here''s one for you. my wife and i were married over a year ago. we sent wedding
    invitations to a number of family members and friends. one of my cousins who lives
    many miles away called to say that she couldn''t attend, and asked whether we
    would like "a this" or "a that" from a prominent store in her town. i chose between
    the two items and thanked her, but now i really can''t recall what the items were.
    well, here it is, a year later, and neither the "this" nor the "that" has arrived.
    my concern: did my cousin forget or decide not to send anything (which is fine),
    or did the store not send it (which isn''t). and, hence, since my cousin may have
    thought a gift was sent and she hasn''t received a "thank-you," she may be miffed.

    i''m writing in response to "flat in flatbush," who asked: "do men feel deceived
    if a woman wears a padded bra-giving the impression that she''s a 34b when she''s
    only a 32a?" abby, who cares? i wore a 34b padded bra so my clothes would fit
    naturally on my skinny, 5-foot-9 frame; deceiving men never entered my mind. do
    men get more sexual excitement and fulfillment from full-breasted women? i can''t
    speak for all men, but i know one who couldn''t care less if i look like twiggy
    or dolly parton. he loves me, not my breasts. how do men feel about augmented
    breasts? i can answer only for mine, and, honey, he loved me before i had breast-augmentation
    surgery, and he loves me now, no more, no less. more important, i feel better
    about myself, and he likes that a lot! so, tell "flat in flatbush" to go for the
    augmentation, but only if she''s doing it for herself and no one else. boy, i''m
    glad to get that (weight) on my chest! augmented in kirkland, wash.'

    concerning "flat in flatbush" and the padded bra question, i am one man who appreciates
    looking at a well-endowed woman, but her measurements have nothing to do with
    her ability to satisfy a man. women do not wear padded bras to "fool" men; they
    wear them so they will look better in their clothes. i am a small-built man who
    would love to be built bigger. when i take off my suit jacket, my shoulders go
    with it. so what? all men''s suits have padding in the shoulders. do women feel
    cheated or deceived when they discover their adonis has padded shoulders? i doubt

    our only daughter is being married soon. we have been planning this wedding for
    nearly a year. it will be a traditional wedding in our church, and a lot of time
    and money has gone into it to make it an exceptionally lovely occasion. in the
    basement of the church is a large room for such celebrations, and we are having
    it professionally decorated with flowers, balloons and ribbons. the problem: the
    groom''s niece is going to be celebrating her 10th birthday on the day of the
    wedding, and they (the groom''s family) want to know if it would be all right
    to bring a birthday cake to the wedding and celebrate "jennifer''s" 10th birthday
    at the same time-since all the flowers and decorations will be there anyway! it
    was suggested, too, that the band play "happy birthday," and all the wedding guests
    could sing "happy birthday to jennifer." abby, i am not in favor of combining
    my daughter''s wedding celebration with jennifer''s 10th birthday. it just doesn''t
    seem fair for them to expect it. is there a nice but firm way to say "no" to this
    nervy suggestion? mother of the bride'

    much has been written about daughter-in-law/mother-in-law relationships. i had
    a wonderful relationship with my mother-in-law until she passed away two years
    ago. i am writing to you now as a mother-in-law who, unfortunately, has not been
    as successful with my own daughter-in-law. if these tips will help just one daughter-in-law
    to improve her relationship with her mother-in-law, it will be well worth the
    time it took to write them. how to get along with your husband''s mother 1. invite
    your in-laws over once in a while. (once a year is better than never.) 2. when
    you are invited to your in-laws'' home for dinner, offer to bring something, and
    also offer to help with the serving and cleaning up afterward. don''t act like
    a guest-you''re family. 3. phone your mother-in-law to ask, "how are you feeling?"
    and make a little small talk. this shows that you are interested in her, which
    will help build a warm, closer relationship. 4. if she has given you a gift, such
    as a sweater or a purse, be sure that she sees you wearing or carrying it at least
    once. 5. if your mother-in-law has given your children clothing, make sure they
    wear those clothes to her home while they are still new and look nice. 6. if per
    chance she has hurt your feelings, don''t complain to your husband, and don''t
    let it fester. say, "mom, you hurt me . . ." then tell her why, so you can put
    it to rest. 7. if she has a daughter, don''t compete with her. accept the fact
    that she''s apt to favor her own daughter. (you will, too, if you have one someday.)
    8. never repeat family gossip. and try not to listen to any. 9. make it a point
    to ask her for something, a recipe or her opinion about something. (you don''t
    have to take it, but it will indicate that you respect her judgment, which is
    sure to make her feel great.) 10. love her son and take good care of him. abby,
    this was written primarily for women who live in the same city , but the bottom
    line is to be considerate, kind and generous. now, if some daughter-in-law wants
    to write 10 tips for mothers-in-law, i''ll welcome them. maybe there are some
    ways i haven''t thought of to encourage my daughter-in-law to love me. mother-in-law'

    approximately 500 years to decompose? during a beach cleanup along 300 miles of
    texas shoreline in 1988, 15,600 plastic six-pack rings were found in three hours.
    these rings-used for canned beer, soft drinks, oil, etc.-have become an ocean
    hazard to birds and other marine life. they''re left on the beach by sun lovers
    and wash into the ocean, or they''re dumped into our waterways along with tons
    of other garbage and gradually make their way into the oceans, or they''re dumped
    into seaside landfills and erosion or wind propels them into the water. once they''re
    floating in the sea, they''re potential hazards to marine life. if you really

    written in plain english by the earthworks group and tells you everything you

    from their "doctor"-or come up with some other phony reason for their absence.

    i recently received a "summons" in the mail telling me i had been chosen for jury
    duty. more than 300 people were questioned by the judge, defense and prosecutor.
    i was picked for a trial that is expected to last 10 days. i now find that my
    boss, who initially told me, "there are ways of getting out of this," is infuriated
    with me for missing work because i "allowed" myself to be picked. for the record,
    i''ve used one sick day in almost four years. abby, this is not a "vacation."
    someone has been accused of a serious crime, and it is up to a jury to determine
    this person''s innocence or guilt. doesn''t anyone remember the principles on
    which this country was founded? if everyone in america dodged jury duty, where
    would we be? i feel proud, honored and obligated to be a part of this process.
    abby, some of my fellow jurors are experiencing the same thing. please print this
    and explain to every boss out there how important this process is. proud to participate

  body: 'dear readers: i recently published 10 tips on how to get along with your
    husband''s mother-submitted by a very wise mother-in-law. then in the interest
    of evenhandedness, i asked for letters from daughters-in-law offering suggestions
    to their mothers-in-law on how to get along with your son''s wife. did i get letters!
    today''s column will be a compilation of the best tips on how to get along with
    your daughter-in-law. 1. when you call to talk with your son and your daughter-in-law
    answers the phone, don''t say, "is `john'' there?" spend a few minutes asking
    how she is and what''s new. and if they live out-of-town, when you write a letter,
    always address it to both your son and his wife. 2. if your son has been previously
    married, don''t bring up his past marriage. if he''s had girlfriends in his past,
    don''t mention them either. if your daughter-in-law has been previously married
    and has children by that marriage, accept these grandchildren as your own. don''t
    play favorites. 3. never offer advice unless it''s asked for. and never criticize
    your daughter-in-law''s housekeeping, cooking, children, friends or new hairdo.
    and don''t try to rearrange her furniture. 4. ask for-and display-pictures that
    include her and her children. every time she looks at them, she will feel wonderful.
    5. never say, "john looks thin, or pale, or tired." his wife will take it as a
    personal insult. 6. if your daughter-in-law has given you a gift, show your appreciation
    by wearing it-or displaying it-proudly. 7. never repeat family gossip. and try
    not to listen to any. 8. don''t allow your son or his wife-in the heat of anger-to
    tell you something unkind about the other. they will eventually kiss and make
    up, and you will be left holding their dirty laundry. 9. don''t drop hints about
    how much you would like to have grandchildren. some couples aren''t ready, some
    couples may have been trying for a long time without success, and some couples
    have decided that they don''t want any-which is strictly their business. 10. and
    one cardinal rule should always be observed. regardless of how close you live
    to each other, never drop in unexpectedly. a telephone call from the corner drugstore
    is all it takes. 11. if perchance she has hurt your feelings, take it up with
    her. do not let it fester, and don''t complain to your son. 12. also-don''t monopolize
    holidays. remember that your daughter-in-law has parents, siblings and friends
    that she might like to spend time with on holidays. some couples may even like
    to spend an occasional holiday by themselves. 13. let your son go. recognize and
    respect him for the adult he is. stop calling him skippy, sonny, junior or any
    other juvenile nickname that he has long outgrown. 14. also, if you have other
    daughters-in-law-or daughters of your own-treat them all equally. and that goes
    for their children, too.'

    may i respond to "appalled in chicago" concerning the present-day secretary''s

    dictation, spell, add, make coffee, water plants and run errands. the problem
    is that the present-day office manager wants a 19-year-old with good buns. well,
    most of us who have first-rate secretarial skills saw "19" many years ago, and
    our buns are sagging. my scores on employment tests have amazed personnel department
    heads, but as soon as the person for whom i would be working takes one look at

    you recently published a humorous piece submitted by a reader who had clipped
    it from her church bulletin. it went like this: "you know you''re growing older
    when . . . you need your glasses to find your glasses. you sit in a rocking chair
    and can''t get it going. your knees buckle, but your belt won''t," etc. it was
    very funny-but in a way, it was also sad. everything about aging was portrayed
    as negative, dreary, downhill and hopeless. how much happier the world would be
    if we''d all look at the bright side of life. remember how happy we were as kids-looking
    forward to summer vacation, looking forward to christmas morning, looking ahead
    to anything that makes us feel good? planning ahead for your 90th birthday beats
    the heck out of expecting to die at 70-as i once did. abby, i woke up at age 70,
    surprised to find that i was still alive and in good health, and i realized that
    this business about being "over the hill" at 60 was a lie! it got me to thinking:
    my mother refused to die until all of her six children could say goodbye. very
    few people die before a birthday, but a whole bunch of people die approximately
    two weeks after their birthdays. here i am, past 90 and looking forward to celebrating
    my 95th. then i''ll decide whether to pick up my option for another five. at 90,
    i''m having the time of my life! in 19-minute speeches, i tell the fellows at
    lions clubs, rotary clubs and others how to postpone their funerals, add years
    to their lives, and life to their years. who could ask for anything more? i''ve
    written a positive version of "you know you''re growing older when." i call mine,
    "you can stay young when: "you quit dreading old age and realize that life begins
    at retirement; it''s your second chance at life-your opportunity to do all the
    things you''ve always wanted to, but never had the time. "you will know you are
    staying young when you stop thinking you''re getting senile because you forgot
    something that wasn''t very important in the first place. "you will know you''re
    staying young when your joints suddenly hurt, and you think, `well, what can i
    expect at my age?'' "you can stay young by planning your next birthday the day
    after you finish celebrating the last one. (even if you don''t make it, you''ll
    have more fun than if you never tried.) "you will stay young when you realize
    that our creator gave us brains so we can make our own decisions. then he gave
    us a choice of living 70 or 100 years, so you need not join the 68 percent who
    were healthy enough to reach 60, but never made it past 75. (their own mental
    attitude set the date of their funerals.) "to the 32 percent who reached 60 in
    good health, survived beyond 75, and are still young, never forget that the first
    4-minute mile run in history was duplicated 317 times within two years after roger
    bannister showed the world it could be done! "the 32 percent who are staying young
    are positive thinkers who like it here and are determined to stay as long as they
    feel useful and needed. it''s a great world-why leave it?" e.l. stephenson, springdale,

    i am 15 and i want to join a convent. the problem is, i am not catholic. i''m
    not really anything, but i want to become a nun because i''ve never had a date
    and i''ll probably never have one, and if i were a nun in a convent, i wouldn''t
    have to make any excuses. after all, who ridicules a nun for not having a boyfriend?
    how does a girl go about signing up to be a nun? please answer in the paper because
    i don''t have any privacy here. if anyone in my family found out i asked you such
    a question, i''d never hear the end of it. future nun'

    dad died suddenly of a massive heart attack on the tennis court. it was a terrible
    shock to mom. they had been married for 48 years. mom''s new-age therapist gave
    her one year only to mourn dad''s death, then she ordered her to get on with her
    life. this therapist then introduced mom to an older man whom she had been treating
    for depression. the man''s wife has alzheimer''s and has been out of touch with
    reality for many years. you can probably guess the rest of this story. now mom,
    at age 70, is keeping company with this married man. (she says it''s platonic,
    but i''m not so sure.) i''ve been trying to convince her to break it off with
    him. my two brothers see nothing wrong with her conduct and tell me to mind my

    four years ago, my wife of 22 years divorced me without explanation. i have dated
    half a dozen women since. the first five were as self-centered as my wife, but
    i really fell for the sixth. we dated for eight months, then she decided i wasn''t
    the one, so she dumped me. she has dated and slept with five guys since she dumped
    me. how do i know? she calls every week to confide her problems and ask my advice,
    sometimes crying and carrying on for an hour or more. (the latest is that she
    fears she might be pregnant.) how do i tell her that it really hurts when she
    does this because i still care for her? also, where do i go to meet women who
    care about something besides themselves? please don''t tell me churches, social

    i hope this letter makes your column because i''m sure i''m not the only one with
    this complaint. with each passing year, older family members break up their homes
    to move to smaller quarters. and what do they do with their family heirlooms?
    they hand them down to their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, etc. i
    never receive any of these things. why? because i have no children to pass them
    along to. consequently, i am deprived of the pleasure of enjoying family heirlooms

    dogs to bark, but i don''t believe it should be allowed constantly. it''s nice
    to have a dog alert you when a stranger comes on your property, but these dogs
    bark at everything. a bird flies low: "bark, bark, bark!" the wind blows: "bark,
    bark, bark!" a car drives down the street: "bark, bark, bark!" i can''t sleep,
    read, watch television or entertain friends without interference from this canine
    quartet! i''ve called the police, but they can''t do anything unless the animals
    are loose and invading my property. my question: do dogs have more rights than
    people? i work, pay my taxes, support my family, and i''m a contributing member
    of my community. what do these dogs contribute? nothing. so what do i do? if you

  subject: Radiator cap can stay put
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    phil arendt is manager of automotive information for the aaa-chicago motor club.
    q-the radiator cap on my 1989 chevrolet caprice is almost impossible to remove
    without the help of channel-lock pliers, which bend the top of the radiator. i
    thought it would be a good idea to replace the cap with a lever release cap; but
    an auto parts store salesperson told me, "no way. it won''t work with your cooling
    recovery system." is that true? e.c., west side a-it''s somewhat correct. however,
    it''s also possible the counter person didn''t have the part in stock. in any
    event, you should ask yourself: why open the cap? with your car, it''s best to
    check the radiator level by looking at the coolant reservoir tank. if it''s low,
    add a 50-50 mix of coolant and water to the tank, not to the radiator. remove
    the radiator cap only when the system needs flushing, or to replace the cap because
    it doesn''t hold pressure, or because the car overheats and needs service. if
    you are determined to have a lever release cap, visit another auto supply store.
    the same lever release cap is used on 1977 through 1990 full-size general motors
    cars. q-i took my 1987 mercury grand marquis to a dealer to have the drive belts
    replaced. when i paid the bill i was shocked. one belt cost $26.96 and the other
    $36.50. when i questioned the price, the service manager told me the dealership
    charges ford motor co.''s suggested retail price. is this price-gouging? r.g.l.,
    palatine a-if you had told me which belts were replaced, i would be able to look
    up the prices. of course, you should have asked for the price of the belts before
    allowing the mechanic to replace them. the explanation the service manager gave
    you is weak, but valid. actually, he can charge whatever he wants for the belts.
    when i was a service manager and a customer questioned me about parts prices,
    i would use the suggested "book" price. i even would show the customer the actual
    price in the book. once the customer saw the book, no more questions were asked.
    q-sure, i enjoy reading your column, but i don''t always agree with you. recently,
    m.a.c. from michigan city, ind., touted using synthetic oil in his car. i agree
    with him. i use synthetic oil in my 1985 plymouth colt, which has 80,000 miles
    and is still going strong. the main reason i use synthetic oil is for convenience.
    instead of changing the oil every 3,000 miles, i can extend oil change intervals
    a bit. i prefer changing the oil myself and using a synthetic, instead of allowing
    a gum-chewing teenager at a quick-change shop to attack my car. what do you say
    to that? t.h., sycamore a-as a gum-chewing guy going through mid-life crisis,
    i still advocate natural motor oil over synthetics. i always caution that oil
    and filter must be changed every 3,000 miles or three months. because synthetics
    are more expensive than natural oil, save your money and go with the traditional
    product. q-if you answer this question, it may save my marriage. i have 128,000
    miles on my 1978 cadillac sedan deville. the car is in good condition. over the
    years various parts have been replaced, including the water pump, starter motor
    and brakes. there are a few annoying rattles and the body has a couple of rust
    spots. i want to keep this car, but my wife wants a new one. i think the cars
    detroit builds today are inferior to my ''78. should i spend $5,000 on this car
    or spend $25,000 on a new one? f.e.f., south side a-this is a case where i probably
    should have passed your letter on to the tribune''s dear abby or ann landers,
    but here goes: dr. gizmo''s rules of life include: cars don''t last forever, you
    only live once and i can''t remember the last time i won an argument with my wife.
    if it were me, i''d rather not sink $5,000 into the old buggy, only to perhaps
    face more expensive mechanical repairs down the road. i''d ask the wife to pick
    the color for a new car. otherwise, if money isn''t the issue, keep the old caddy
    for yourself and buy her a new car. oh, now i can remember the last argument i
    won at home. it was when i didn''t tell the wife about the new car i bought. after
    i made the purchase, the better half was happy to take the keys to the new car.
    she gave me her old buggy. q-in a recent column, you wrote that gasoline can get
    into the motor oil. the way i see it, the only way that can happen is if a gasket
    blows. i have a fuel-injected engine. can gas get into the oil in my car? j.s.,
    downers grove a-yes, because your theory is all wet. gas usually mixes with oil
    during what is commonly called flooding the engine. it''s more prevalent during
    the winter months, but may occur at any time. when an engine floods, gasoline
    leaks past the piston rings in the cylinder and down into the oil pan. once the
    gas mixes with the oil, the oil loses its ability to lubricate the engine. dr.
    gizmo''s rule of thumb: if an engine floods, change the oil and filter to remove
    the gasoline and ensure a fresh supply of oil for proper engine lubrication. otherwise,
    you may end up with costly repairs. ---------- readers may send technical questions
    about cars and trucks to him at dr. gizmo, aaa-chicago motor club, 999 e. touhy

    i must take exception to your advice to "his wife in ohio," who was whining about
    her non-existent sex life due to her new husband''s weight. first, she was aware
    of his weight, and had even slept with him prior to marrying him. second, i was
    dismayed by your assumption that the problem was his and he needed psychiatric
    treatment. abby, you are perpetuating a very destructive form of discrimination
    that is rampant in this country. it is neither a sin nor a sign of mental illness
    to be overweight. i''ve fought a weight problem all my life, so your suggesting
    that he should fix his "problem" so his wife can have the sex life she is "entitled
    to" is incredibly callous. what about the sex life he is entitled to? a better
    response would have been to send her to a shrink to solve her culturally induced
    hang-ups, so she could start living up to her marriage vows. with a little love
    in their relationship, maybe he''d have an easier time losing weight. denver dave'

    i am appalled at the attitude of "73 and resigned" who lamented about having no
    grandsons to carry on the family name. don''t his three granddaughters count for
    something? they are descendants of the same hudson river fur trader as he is,
    and they should be just as proud to have that heritage. the family surname may
    eventually become a maiden name for them, but that doesn''t change their ancestry.
    the roots of george bush and franklin delano roosevelt can be traced back to john
    tilley, who came over on the mayflower, and yet those presidents do not carry
    the tilley name. many people can detail their lineage back to the other mayflower
    passengers and revolutionary war soldiers, too, without currently having the same
    surnames as those colonial americans did. my advice to "73" is to have him talk
    with his granddaughters and to share the whole family history with them as soon
    as possible. years from now, those girls won''t have to wonder about their heritage

    i told him i was aware of what was going on between them, he said it was over,
    and he loved me-not her! i asked him to get rid of her. he said he would-in time-but
    it''s been three months, and she''s still in his office. am i wrong to want him
    to get a new secretary? i feel hurt that he hasn''t made good his promise yet.
    what should i do? should i believe him when he says it''s all over between them?
    untrusting and unhappy'

    we often read about animals and children suffocating in cars and in discarded
    refrigerators, so it''s time to tell my story: when my youngest son was 3, i was
    a single mom with a nanny/housekeeper. the nanny knew that we would be grocery
    shopping on saturday, so on friday, she defrosted the refrigerator and removed
    all the shelves. saturday morning, we were chatting about the week''s events and
    making plans for the day while the children were watching a movie. the 3-year-old
    got up to get a toy, and after five minutes or so, i asked, "where''s jesse?"
    i went upstairs: no jesse. i called out to him while nanny searched downstairs.
    we heard jesse crying in a faraway voice that was hard to locate. "where are you!
    jesse?" "i fell in." we heard his faraway voice, but we couldn''t locate the origin
    of it! five more minutes elapsed. i called 911. the firemen and police arrived,
    searched the fireplace, heater vents, attic and everywhere a toddler might climb
    or fall. finally, as i stood exasperated in the kitchen, a fireman opened the
    refrigerator, and out fell jesse, face red from lack of oxygen, cold, and blinded
    by the sudden light! abby, please ask parents to get safety locks for their refrigerators,
    and to never remove shelves to clean them without replacing them immediately.

    a 25-year-old woman wrote to say that she and her live-in boyfriend were expecting

  subject: Infant's sudden death devastates parents
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    last november, my husband and i went to awaken our 3 1/2-month-old son, only to
    find him dead in his crib! the cause: sudden infant death syndrome (sids), more
    commonly known as "crib death." there are no symptoms. almost as devastating as
    the loss of our son was the confusion and frustration that followed. because so
    little is known about sids, parents are often left to face cruel questions from
    well-meaning but unenlightened friends and family. it is difficult to understand
    how a child who appears to be perfectly healthy and normal could die so suddenly
    for no apparent reason. abby, will you please print the following facts to enlighten
    your readers: 1. sids is the sudden and unexpected death of an apparently healthy
    infant; the cause remains unexplained, even after an autopsy. 2. sids is the no.
    1 cause of death among infants between the ages of 1 week and 1 year, although
    it is most likely to occur between the ages of 2 to 4 months. 3. an average of
    7,000 babies die of sids every year. 4. sids is not caused by suffocation, aspiration
    or regurgitation. most sids victims appear to be healthy before death, although
    a few may show symptoms of a slight cold shortly before death. 5. sids is not
    caused by child abuse or an immunization; it''s neither contagious nor hereditary;
    and it occurs in families of all social and economic levels. 6. sids cannot be
    predicted or prevented. while the chilling question, "why did your baby die?"
    still cannot be answered, sids experts today believe that some subtle abnormality
    in infant development occurring in the fetal stages predisposes some babies to
    sids. our only hope in learning more about sids lies in research. parents who
    experience this tragedy have special needs. the best advice i can offer to their
    families and friends is: don''t say, "you''ll have more children." don''t set
    limits on how long the parents should grieve. and, above all, don''t try to substitute
    other children in the family to "replace" the one they''ve lost. each child is
    irreplaceable. the best advice i can offer parents is: please become better educated
    about sids. had i known more about it, i wouldn''t have tortured myself with guilt
    and blame for my baby''s death. sign me: missing my baby in ashland, ky.'

    this story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts. this is part 2. i kept
    all the letters from readers pertaining to the divorce-more than 35,000 of them.
    why? i''m not sure. maybe because they were so beautiful. i couldn''t throw them
    out. they are the only letters that i''ve ever kept. my readers told me not to
    think that because my marriage didn''t last forever, i wasn''t qualified to advise
    others. they said the experience would make me better qualified, and they were
    right. i don''t know if writing the column and reading about other people''s problems
    have affected the way i handle my own. i never confuse my identity with my readers.
    but i''m sure that what i have learned from them has given me strength. i''ve
    seen how people live through terrible tragedies and emerge stronger in the broken
    places. a divorce is nothing compared with the problems i see in my everyday mail.
    there are millions of people out there who have had rotten luck and fought their
    way back. the column has given me a healthy perspective and made me realize how
    fortunate i''ve been. i truly feel joined at the heart with my readers. i would
    rather have my column on 1,000 refrigerator doors than win a pulitzer. i don''t
    have a great deal of time for hobbies, but i make it a point to take time for
    myself. my work is never finished. there is always so much to do. i could easily
    become a workaholic, so i see to it that i have a social life. i set aside "play
    time," time for fun. i have interesting gentlemen friends. chicago has a fabulous
    symphony, the lyric opera and good theater. i''ve been blessed with friends who
    are marvelous to me. many single women, when they''re divorced or widowed, are
    left out. that never happened to me. in addition to my chicago pals, i have friends
    who invite me to fabulous parties on both coasts and some cities in between. i''ve
    already penciled in a hot-air-balloon party in normandy, france, for next june.
    i visit my sisters in omaha and beverly hills, and i vacation with friends in
    greenwich, palm springs, martha''s vineyard, southampton, palm beach, london,
    etc. i visit my daughter, margo, and her husband, ken, and the grandkids in connecticut,
    boston and minneapolis. we always have thanksgiving together. my family is a joy
    to me, the frosting on the cake. i''m often asked about my relationship with my
    twin sister, dear abby. it isn''t true that we fight. we get along fine. all siblings
    are competitive and, being twins, we are probably more competitive than ordinary
    sisters. but she''s a great girl with a marvelous sense of humor, and when we
    get together, our mouths never stop. we make each other laugh in a way that no
    one else can. we both have fax machines, and we fax each other like crazy. if
    i see a column of hers that i think is especially good, i''ll tear it out and
    fax it to her with a note saying, "this is great." she does the same for me. it''s
    irritating to read that we aren''t speaking. that is simply not true. professionally,
    we compete, but there are plenty of newspapers for both of us, and in some cities,
    her column and mine appear in the same paper. this does not bother either of us.
    this is a killer job. i often work 14 hours a day. i pick letters that demand
    a lot of me. it would be easy to print run-of-the-mill stuff, but i select letters
    that give me an opportunity to teach people something. this was my mission from
    the beginning. i have always viewed my column as an opportunity to educate. you
    cannot read my column regularly and not learn something. it always tickles me
    when i meet middle-aged people who say: "you raised me. my mother used to put
    your column in my lunch bag and on my dinner plate. when i went away to college,
    she''d mail the damned things to me with a note saying, `read this!'' now i''m
    mailing your column to my kids who are away at college, and i''m saying the same
    thing!" in addition to being able to reach millions of people, the column has
    empowered me to do some real good in the world. for example, years ago i printed
    a column about the most feared word in the english language-cancer. there was
    a bill before congress designating $100 million for cancer research. it needed
    president nixon''s signature. i asked my readers to clip the column and send it
    to washington. well-all hell broke loose. more than a million pieces of mail hit
    washington. capitol hill had never seen anything like it. no politician could
    afford to ignore that kind of pressure. president nixon signed the national cancer
    act in 1971, and we got the money. it''s been said that you can tell a lot about
    a person by the enemies they''ve made. it''s true. not everybody loves me. for
    a long time now i''ve been battling some mighty powerful opponents. as a strong
    supporter of planned parenthood and a woman''s right to choose, i receive a lot
    of ugly mail from the anti-abortion people. i also get nasty letters from members
    of the national rifle association. the number of people killed by handguns in
    this country is appalling. i am now fighting for the brady bill, which would require
    a seven-day waiting period before a person can buy a handgun. the nra says it
    would be "inconvenient." my position is that anyone who is in that big a hurry
    to get a gun shouldn''t have one. the animal-rights people would also dearly love
    to see me drop into a very deep hole. i believe it is absolutely imperative that
    animals be used to further medical research. for example, experiments using monkeys
    are essential to unlock the mysteries of the aids virus. animal-rights activists
    have broken into laboratories, let the monkeys out of the cages, smashed expensive
    equipment and destroyed research. i call these zealots "terrorists." the names
    they call me cannot be printed in a family newspaper. i receive approximately
    2,000 letters daily. no one screens the mail for me. i select all the letters
    that go into the column, and i do all my own writing. there are no little ghosts
    sitting at my typewriter. i have a staff of eight secretaries and two mail clerks.
    they are the most dedicated, hardest-working people i know. my office runs like
    a well-oiled machine. the amount of work they turn out every day is simply staggering.
    i could never do the job half as well without these incredible assistants. after
    all these years, i still attack every batch of mail with enthusiasm. i guess i
    must be a little crazy, but i continue to be excited by this work. some of the
    handwriting is terrible, but i''ve become a master at hieroglyphics. the number
    of people who write to me just to unload is surprising. they will go on for 12
    or 14 pages, and then i find there is no name or address. they end the letter
    by saying: "thanks for letting me get this off my chest, ann. i feel a lot better
    now." i am well aware that a life that has been messed up for 20 years cannot
    be straightened out with one letter from ann landers or two inches of newspaper
    space. many people who write to me need a lot more help than i can give them.
    the most important thing i do is something that many readers don''t ever know
    about. i refer people to service agencies so they can get the kind of ongoing
    help they need. we have, on computer, the addresses and telephone numbers of hundreds
    of service agencies and self-help groups in the u.s. and canada. people need to
    know how to get in touch with alcoholics anonymous, catholic charities, the lutheran
    family services and the jewish federation. they need to know about the drug-abuse
    centers, the support groups and the toll-free hot lines for the depressed and
    the suicidal and for rape victims, battered women and missing children. most of
    the self-help groups cost nothing to join. they extend a warm welcome to anyone
    who shows up. but people need to know they exist and how to contact them. telling
    them is the best thing i do. i am often asked if all the letters that appear in
    my column are on the level. people frequently say, "some of those letters are
    so fantastic, i think you make them up." let me assure you that every letter that
    appears in my column is real. the most frequent problems i get are about personal
    relationships. among the toughest of these involve women who are married to or
    living with men who are abusive, unfaithful, alcoholic or drug-addicted. they
    say: "don''t tell me to leave him because i can''t. and don''t suggest joint counseling.
    he won''t go." so what is there left to tell them? i say: "the only way a relationship
    will get better is if both people work at it. if he refuses to work at it and
    you insist on staying with him, there is nothing i can do to help you." i then
    suggest that she ask herself that famous ann landers question, "would your life
    be better with him or without him?" many women have written back to say: "thank
    you, ann. i''ve decided i''d be better off without him, and i''m kicking the bum
    out." how do the letters today compare with the letters i received 35 years ago?
    well, for one thing, the problems i am hearing about today are more disturbing.
    they reflect a serious deterioration of american family life. marriage is no longer
    viewed as a lifelong commitment. fifty percent of all couples who marry today
    will end up divorced. the average marriage lasts seven years. americans have the
    highest divorce rate in the world. there''s a great deal of guilt on the part
    of working mothers. they are ambivalent about leaving young children. they write:
    "it kills me to leave my 2- and 4-year-old kids at the day-care center every morning,
    but i have to work. i have no choice." and then there are the women who feel guilty
    about staying home. they worked hard to get their m.b.a.''s and gave up lucrative
    jobs for motherhood. "the woman who replaced me is now making $60,000 a year,"
    writes mrs. x of morristown, n.j. "when i go back to work two years from now,
    i''ll have to take considerably less. i really resent this, and i try not to take
    it out on the kids, but i''m not sure i''m succeeding." i hear a lot about drug
    abuse. it is ruining millions of lives. now we have crack, which is cheap, easy
    to get and dangerously addictive. the drug problem has created overcrowded prisons
    and jammed our criminal-justice system. assaults and murders, clearly drug-connected,
    have reached an all-time high in new york, chicago, detroit, miami and los angeles.
    teenage gangs and drive-by shootings have made the streets unsafe. babies have
    been shot in their mother''s arms. at one time i seriously considered speaking
    out for the legalization of drugs but decided against it. after considerable soul-searching,
    i concluded that legalization would lead to a whole new set of problems. can you
    imagine what life would be like if surgeons, bus drivers, pilots, air-traffic
    controllers, teachers, nurses, firemen and policemen were on drugs? and it would
    be legal! i have had a ringside seat to life, and the changes i have seen would
    twirl your turban. thirty-five years ago a paper in michigan refused to print
    a column i had written about homosexuality. today same-sex couples want the financial
    benefits that married couples have, tax breaks, hospital visitation and home ownership.
    i agree that they should have them. the world is moving so fast these days that
    i am running as fast as i can to keep up with the changes. it''s exhausting, but
    it''s exciting. i frankly admit, however, that i''m glad i have already lived
    the greater part of my life. i''m not sure i would want to be around 50 years
    from now. a few months ago on a tv show in seattle, i was asked where i get the
    energy to do this job. i replied: "i honestly don''t know. i think it must come
    from some place outside of me." i believe that is true. i have never been a deeply
    religious person, but i have always had a strong and abiding faith. when i look
    at what my life has been like and the gifts i''ve been given, i know i did not
    do all this myself. every night before i go to sleep, i read something from the
    old testament, and i pray that i can give back a small part of what has been given
    to me. what are my plans for the future? where am i going from here? no place.
    i have no plans to retire. i intend to write the column as long as i have all
    my marbles and the strength to do the job. i still exercise 40 minutes every morning,
    and i feel marvelous. i will probably slump over at my typewriter when i am 90,
    and that will be it. at least that is the way i would like it to be. illustration

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a retired woodshop teacher. i taught in the public school system for 27 years.
    during that time, i had to moonlight at other jobs as i had some major medical
    problems in my family. i moonlighted for 16 years in law enforcement. i worked
    as a policeman in three different agencies-city police, sheriff''s department
    and university police. while i was growing up, my parents were the final authority.
    in fact, i would rather have faced the police than my dad. if i got into trouble
    his thinking was, "they didn''t just decide to pick on my son for no reason. he
    must have done something to get their attention." that was enough to cause my
    dad concern about my conduct. this type of home authority has changed drastically
    in our society. if a child gets into trouble, his parents usually become allies
    with him against all forms of authority-police, schools, courts, etc. by not publishing
    the names of juveniles, a record is allowed to build and attitudes to develop.
    the family and young lawbreaker become anonymous, and the crimes become more frequent
    and violent. when the child gets old enough to be charged as an adult, everybody
    wonders, "when did he start going wrong?" the truth is, he had been going wrong
    for a long time but he was sheltered. it started when he stole the first piece
    of candy from the grocery store. he was just a 7-year-old kid, so it was "no big
    deal." it started again when he stole another kid''s bike-then it was probably
    just a "mistake." it started when he was underage and drunk-"oh, that was just
    a part of growing up." while i was a teacher, i had the opportunity to talk to
    students who told me that they could do almost anything except murder until they
    were 18, and it wouldn''t matter because at 18, they would get a clean slate.
    i have always felt that if the parents or the single parent who is raising the
    child will not accept responsibility for their child''s acts or actions, they
    should be forced by law to take responsibility. as you said, abby, you cannot
    legally publish the names of juveniles in the newspapers, but you could certainly
    publish the names of the parents. example: "the young son of mr. and mrs. john
    doe was found guilty of beating up an 80-year-old woman and robbing her of $3."
    i say, if you cannot charge the juvenile-charge the parent! this may very well
    help to bring child crime down. however, it may increase what may now be termed
    as "child abuse." there may very well be a few little warm butts around. and the
    80-year-old lady may have a little less to worry about in the future. thanks,
    abby, for letting me have my say. don banks, fort collins, colo.'

    most of us remember spending many pleasurable summer days riding our bicycles
    through the neighborhood on the way to a friend''s house or to the corner store.
    times have changed. that innocent ride can be very dangerous if children do not
    wear bicycle helmets. adults often forget that there are more and faster cars
    on the road than when they were kids. many think that because they survived the
    bumps and bruises of childhood, their children will, too. unfortunately, that''s
    not always the case. each year 500 children die and more than 380,000 are seriously
    injured because of collisions while on bicycles. in the united states, more than
    50,000 children suffer head injuries in bike-related incidents. adults tend to
    think of bikes as "toys" and, consequently, they do not teach their children to
    follow the rules of the road. (most collisions occur as a result of children riding
    in the street without first looking or yielding to traffic, riding against the
    flow of traffic, ignoring the rules of the road or swerving suddenly to make a
    turn.) abby, helmets can prevent 85 percent of serious head injuries-they are
    crucial to the safety of children. parents should set a good example by wearing
    bicycle helmets themselves when they ride-with or without their children. children
    need to be taught that a bike is a vehicle-not a toy-and, as such, cyclists must
    follow the rules of the road. wearing a helmet should be a condition for riding
    a bicycle, not an option. no helmet-no bike riding! bike helmets save lives. what
    better reason is there to make sure your child wears one? herta b. feely, executive

    i had been married for 10 years and had been faithful to my husband, and never

    felt no need to run another test to confirm the diagnosis as i had complained
    of the symptoms and he was 99 percent sure. but if i wanted to be sure which sexually
    transmitted disease i had, they would take a sample for the test. then i went
    home and confronted my husband. he said there was no possibility that this was

    sample from him. we were both treated for a week while waiting for our tests to

    quite a mistake, i might add, as i''m due to deliver our first child in february.

    in response to "suramericano''s" letter wondering whether to tell his family that
    he had tested positive for aids, i can offer the viewpoint of a family member
    who wasn''t told until it was too late. my dear cousin chose to tell only his
    parents and siblings, and then only after the aids virus had become active. i
    respect my cousin''s right to make this decision, but knowing now that he was
    gay and died of aids doesn''t cause me to cherish his memory less. however, many
    things continue to haunt me-the visits i would have made, the things i might have
    said, the understanding that was never achieved. was he ashamed? or did he think
    i would be ashamed? was it really necessary for him and his immediate family to
    be so isolated during his final ordeal? my choice as a family member would have

    i am a widow of modest means living in washington state. i recently entertained
    a friend who lives in florida. her two grown daughters, who are both quite well-to-do,
    were in town en route to a vacation in hawaii, so i invited them to join their
    mother at my home for dinner before she flew back to florida. one daughter asked
    to use my telephone. then she proceeded to make three long-distance calls without
    reversing the charges. all three women chatted at great length with their families
    some 3,000 miles away. abby, i am nonplussed as to how to handle this situation.
    should i send the itemized telephone bill to the mother? (i don''t know the last

    it was just a case of thoughtlessness or bad manners. i wish i were in a position

    what do you give a 78-year-old woman who doesn''t need anything and can buy anything
    she wants? the woman is our mother. the occasion was her birthday, so all five
    daughters came home to elgin, ill., for the weekend to help mom celebrate. we
    included her only sister and her grown granddaughter. we all got into my station
    wagon and drove to sears for a family photograph. then we drove to chicago where
    my father had his business 30 years ago. from there, we drove to our old home
    from which we moved in 1954. we had dinner at the restaurant where my sister had
    worked 20 years ago. the next morning we all went out for a farewell breakfast
    and then went on our way. the memories of that weekend meant just as much to us
    five daughters as they did to mom. and the memories will last much longer than
    any material gift we could have given her. just thought i''d like to share this

    you think it would be inviting rumors to have a man stand up with me? (my mother
    thinks so.) my fiance has offered to let leon be an usher, but i want him to be
    there in the role of the person who has been the nearest and dearest friend of

    i live at home with my mother (i''m 25), and a young man named "bo" lives with
    us. (he''s 21.) bo has been here almost a year. we dated less than two months,
    when he stayed over one night. the next day, before i could take him home, his
    mother came and dumped all his belongings on my front lawn. bo had no job and
    nowhere to go, so mother and i took him in. a year later, he still has no job.
    last month, he was arrested for violation of probation. as part of the condition
    of his probation, he has to attend a group therapy class once a week. but here''s
    the real problem: i was born and raised in a strict baptist home. (my father was
    a minister.) when i met bo, i went back on everything i ever believed in: no sex
    before marriage, no living together. my mother did the same. last month, i decided
    to go back to my church. i refused to have sex with bo, and he hit the ceiling.
    no matter what scripture i showed him in the bible, his answer was, "this is the
    ''90s." when i went back to church, i met a man i was drawn to immediately. i''ve
    only talked to him once, and that was when he was going around shaking hands.
    when his hand touched mine, sparks flew. he sings in the choir, and he stares
    at me the whole time. he is deeply religious, very handsome, polite and well-dressed.
    he is a beautiful, super person. what am i going to do about bo? i don''t love
    him. i realize now that i never did love him. i feel sorry for him because if
    we make him leave, he will have nowhere to go. he can also get violent if he thinks
    someone has wronged him. i am trapped, abby! what should i do? miserable in the

    we took him, raised him and loved him. in his teen-age years, he took his first
    beer, and from that day on, every dime he got went for alcohol. sober, he was
    charming, sensitive and caring. drunk, he was mean, abusive and unreasonable.
    we had brought him home from a large city, hoping to help him after he had become
    a street person. we got him into a treatment center. he had counseling and went
    to aa. he used to ask me why i didn''t go to al-anon, and i would say, "because
    i am not the one with the problem, you are!" how i wish i had gone! now i have

    my very dear friend and i are both in our 60s. we have been seeing each other
    socially for eight years, with no plans to marry. he drinks beer constantly, usually
    starting at noon. he doesn''t "chug-a-lug" it, but nurses it along. however, when
    he gets up to throw the empty can in the recycler, he immediately goes to the
    refrigerator for another beer, and the process continues until bedtime. in one
    day, he can easily consume a dozen beers! i have talked to him as gently as possible
    about this, but he just laughs and says he can handle it-he''s been doing it for
    years. i have driven him home many times. abby, this is getting to me. i''m beginning
    not to want to be around him anymore. between the beer drinking and the cigar
    smoke, frankly, he stinks! we do not live together, so i could ease out of the
    relationship, but i hate to end a longtime friendship. he insists that he''s a
    beer drinker, not an alcoholic. what are the facts? patience strained'

    my ladyfriend and i are supposed to be in love. we have been intimate and have
    considered a life together. there is, however, one obstacle. she currently insists
    upon continuing a "just friends" relationship with four or five of her ex-lovers,
    including an ex-husband to whom she was married 10 years ago-for only one year.
    (no children.) these relationships consist of christmas correspondence, occasional
    phone calls and visits that include overnight stays. she says that in her previous
    social circles, this is considered normal behavior. in my circle, it is not condoned.
    i am of a jealous nature, and insist that all such contacts with her ex-lovers
    stop as a requisite for a serious, long-term life together. what is the "norm"

  body: 'dear readers: tomorrow will mark the 14th annual great american smokeout,
    a one-day campaign to encourage smokers to quit smoking for 24 hours, just to
    prove they can do it. last year, more than 19.5 million smokers tried to quit
    for the day. this represents more than 39 percent of the nation''s 50 million
    smokers. breast cancer used to be the biggest killer for women. but the no. 1
    cause of cancer death among women and men today is lung cancer. an estimated 142,000
    will die of lung cancer in 1990. and now, a word about smoking-related diseases-emphysema,
    chronic bronchitis and heart disease: this year an estimated 390,000 will die
    from one of these. this total exceeds the number of u.s. battle deaths in world
    war ii; it is nine times as many people who die in automobile accidents every
    year! a congressional study has reported that health costs from the adverse effects
    of smoking have reached a new high of $100 billion a year in increased medical
    bills and lost productivity. the loss in death and disability cannot be measured.
    (and how does one measure the amount of heartache, remorse and guilt suffered
    as a result of a preventable, self-induced tragedy?) what about "secondhand" smoke?
    is it damaging to non-smokers to be in the presence of those who are smoking?
    yes! furthermore, studies reveal that the children of smokers are more prone to
    lung problems and allergies than are children of non-smokers. for years i have
    begged my young readers, "if you smoke, quit now. if you don''t smoke, don''t
    start!" yet an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 kids light up for the first time every
    day. why? peer pressure, no doubt. quitting "cold turkey" is the hardest way to
    quit, but my readers have told me it''s the most effective, and in the long run,
    the easiest way. cutting down is less traumatic, but the temptation to smoke is
    often too powerful to resist while smoking just one, two or three cigarettes a
    day. those who are heavily addicted may require help to break the habit. call
    your local chapter of the american cancer society for information. so if you''re
    hooked on cigarettes and have been telling yourself, "one of these days i''m going
    to quit," why not start tomorrow? it won''t be easy, but it will be the best thanksgiving
    present you can give yourself-and those who love you. love, abby p.s. a favor,
    please? if you quit tomorrow, even for 24 hours, i want to hear from you. then
    write again and let me know how long you were able to stay "clean." good luck.

  body: 'dear readers: here''s an update on my traditional thanksgiving column: tomorrow
    is thanksgiving, so why not take a few minutes to count your blessings? how''s
    your health? you have a few minor complaints? well, thank god they''re not major.
    obviously you''re still alive. you can probably think of at least one person who
    isn''t around this year. (i can.) if you awakened this morning and were able to
    hear the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the table
    on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one), praise
    the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. (say a prayer for those who perished in a
    fire, a flood, an earthquake or an accident.) how''s your pocketbook? thin? well,
    most of the world is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no
    social security. no medicare. in fact, one-third of the people in the world will
    go to bed hungry tonight. would you rather be in poland, the soviet union or iraq-god
    forbid! are you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls
    you, pick up the phone and call somebody. go out of your way to do something nice
    for someone. it''s a sure cure for the blues. are you concerned about your country''s
    future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern. if you don''t like
    your elected officials, you can go to work and vote them out of office. we still
    have the soapbox and the ballot box. freedom rings! you can still worship at the
    church of your choice, or not worship at all if you don''t want to. you can cast
    a secret ballot, or criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head
    or a knock at your door in the middle of the night. and if you prefer to live
    under a different system, goodbye and good luck. you are free to go. there are
    no walls or barbed wire fences to keep you here. in closing, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving
    prayer. perhaps you will want to use it at your table tomorrow. let one of the
    children read it. "o, heavenly father, we thank thee for food and remember the
    hungry. "we thank thee for health and remember the sick. "we thank thee for friends
    and remember the friendless. "we thank thee for freedom and remember the enslaved.
    "may these remembrances stir us to service "that thy gifts to us may be used for
    others. "and, dear god, please bless and watch over our men and women in the persian
    gulf and bring them home safely-and soon. amen." have a wonderful thanksgiving,
    and may god bless you and yours. love, abby p.s. special greetings to those of
    you in the military who wrote from korea, okinawa, japan and the philippines to
    tell me you are using my thanksgiving prayer.'

    i need your advice. six months ago, my husband and i separated. i moved out and
    took all my belongings and half of "our" belongings with me. i really tried to
    be fair. one thing i kept was a handmade bedspread my husband''s grandmother had
    made and given me five years ago at my bridal shower. abby, i have dearly loved
    this woman and kept the bedspread partly because of what she has meant to me.
    i felt she would want me to have it. however, recently my former husband called
    to tell me he wants the bedspread back-that his grandmother told him she wants
    him to have it. well, i am hurt over this because i thought my feelings for her
    were reciprocated. i even wonder if perhaps my husband didn''t fabricate the story.
    anyway, i want to do the right thing. i haven''t spoken to her yet because i fear
    what she may say. this is really hurting me. what should i do? hurting in virginia'

    my sunday school teacher says that god is everywhere. please put this letter in

    when he was hit by the car, my mother prayed to you to let him live but you wouldn''t.
    my little brother was only 2 years old, and he couldn''t have sinned so bad that
    you had to punish him that way. everyone says you are good and can do anything
    you want to do. you could have saved my little brother, but you let him die. you
    broke my mother''s heart. how can i love you?-peter" "dear peter: your question
    is one that has troubled religious men for thousands of years. one great thinker
    wrote a book about it. it is called `job'' and is part of the bible. it says that
    the suffering of innocent people is something we cannot understand. but this much
    is sure: death is not a punishment. it is one of life''s mysteries. speak to your
    minister, peter. communicate with god by praying, and he will help you in your
    search for wisdom and goodness and make your mommy happy again." abby, i saved
    that because it was such a beautiful and sensitive answer to that young boy who
    was hurting. trust your instincts and continue in that way to use your faith.

    i have been a church pastor for many years, during which time i have officiated

    them. i counsel them, rehearse them, conduct the ceremonies and remain for the

    we''d love to have you and your wife come to our reception." abby, my wife and

    i was frustrated by the letter from the retired schoolteacher who advocated the

    i repeatedly warned him that he could not afford the habit and sooner or later
    he would be tempted to steal a pack of cigarettes. well, on his 17th birthday,
    he was caught shoplifting. he went to court, did 12 hours of community service,
    and made restitution. since then, he has never been in any kind of trouble. so
    what would be gained by labeling a 16-year-old kid a thief, or putting our names
    in the paper as irresponsible parents? and what about families with more than
    one son or daughter? wouldn''t the siblings suffer unnecessarily? please, abby,

    for several years, i worked for a man who had a lot of trouble with the truth.
    apparently, he is still lying. although i no longer work for him, the woman he
    has been dating called me recently for some information about him. i acknowledged
    that she had guessed the truth about one area of his past, but i immediately regretted
    i had said anything. when she started quizzing me further, i suggested that she
    ask him directly, which she has never done. she seemed annoyed with my refusal
    to tell her more than i had. it seems that she plans to go to houston (without
    telling him) to track down the whole story. i told her that the answers she wants
    are not so bad, but i felt that the telling of his story was up to him. she still
    insisted she had no intention of asking him. although i am not in touch with this
    man, i''ve considered contacting him to tell him he needs to be honest with this
    woman-especially because she has already guessed some of the truth. i''ve also
    thought of calling her back and suggesting that he may be annoyed when he finds
    out she made a trip to houston-the people at that end will probably tell him.

    that way? it''s time to start preparing for the holidays again, so do yourselves
    a favor and do your christmas or hanukkah shopping now. here''s my annual-slightly
    revised-column on holiday shopping: if you''re wondering what to give aunt olivia
    or grandpa, who doesn''t go out much, let me tell you what not to give them: forget
    dusting powder, after-shave and cologne. (they probably have several unopened
    boxes gathering dust on their closet shelves.) grandpa doesn''t need another necktie,
    and aunt olivia doesn''t really want any more brooches, necklaces, bracelets or
    earrings. with the price of groceries so high, older folks who live alone on a
    fixed income would be delighted to receive a basket of goodies. include small
    cans of salmon, chicken, ham, tuna, fruit, instant coffee, tea bags, crackers,
    cookies and instant soup mixes. older people who live in confined quarters do
    not need more "things." don''t send music boxes, statuettes or other bric-a-brac.
    a truly thoughtful gift: postcards and some lined stationery with envelopes and
    a generous supply of postage stamps. (enclose some felt-tip pens too.) a handy
    gift: an assortment of greeting cards for all occasions, so that they, too, can
    send birthday, anniversary, graduation, get-well and condolence cards to others.
    don''t give a gift of clothing unless you''re absolutely sure the size is right.
    if you''re tempted to pass along a scarf, purse, wallet or some little doodad
    you received three christmases ago, please don''t; the recipient will probably
    find it just as useless as you did. if someone on your gift list is living on
    a pension, a check for any amount would be far more appreciated than some useless
    trinket. another thoughtful gift would be a year''s subscription to a newspaper
    or magazine you are sure he or she will enjoy. never give a pet to anyone unless
    you''re sure it''s wanted and will be cared for. and if you want to delight someone
    who considers his pet a "member of the family," include a tin or two of cat or
    dog food for the pet. don''t give wine or liquor unless you''re sure the recipients
    imbibe. candy, nuts and fruitcake make wonderful gifts for those who aren''t counting
    calories, but please have compassion for those who are, and lead them not into
    temptation. also remember that many older people have difficulty chewing hard
    candies and nuts. instead of giving someone a gift with permission to "take it
    back and exchange it if it''s not what you want," save yourself (and them) time
    and effort by giving gift certificates. for those who maintain their own homes
    and apartments, consider a gift certificate for services such as window washing
    and rug cleaning. and don''t forget certificates for the barbershop, beauty parlor,
    taxi rides or dinner out. holidays can be depressing for people who are alone,
    so if you know someone who might be alone and lonely, give him (or her) the best
    gift of all: an invitation to have a holiday meal with you and your family. loneliness
    is the ultimate poverty. love, abby ---------- to order "how to write letters

    i''ve been married to harry for six years. it''s been a constant struggle to keep
    our marriage going, due to his drinking and my co-dependency. harry has been sober
    for six months, and we are both seeing therapists at an alcohol treatment center.
    recently, we had such a severe crisis that we considered divorce. we both did
    a lot of crying and thinking. (we have four children.) during this time, harry
    went to his parents for emotional support. his mother decided that i am not a
    good wife because i don''t cook big, elaborate meals, and i don''t give harry
    sex often enough, so divorce would be in his best interest. then she cooked a
    pork roast and made sandwiches from the leftovers for him to take to work. she
    brought this lunch to the house while harry wasn''t home and said to me, "you
    don''t like me doing this, do you?" i replied, "no, i don''t." then she shook
    her finger in my face and proceeded to tell me all the things she didn''t like
    about me, so i took her hand in mine and held it at her waist while i attempted
    to correct her misconceptions. then she sat down and waited for harry to come
    home so she could tell him that i had picked a fight with her and twisted her
    arm! can you believe this? what do you think of this woman''s behavior? she has
    been interfering in my marriage since day one, and i am totally exasperated! what
    is your advice? end of my rope'

    married in our synagogue by the rabbi who has been a family friend for many years.
    the problem is, the rabbi can''t marry us unless connie converts to judaism. she
    is willing, and even agrees to raise our children in the jewish faith providing
    i become a practicing jew. she says if she takes the jewish faith she will follow

    i recently saw an item in the richmond times-dispatch, written by stan h. covington
    jr., which read, "the associated press reported that during an interview with
    cbs, saddam hussein said, `god is on our side, and satan is on the side of the
    united states.'' " wonder where hussein received his revelation? perhaps he''s
    holding adolf hitler''s old astrologer hostage, too! during world war ii, while
    i was serving with the 3rd army in germany, i removed a belt buckle from the uniform
    of a dead soldier. the lettering on the buckle read: "gott mit uns." (god is with
    us.) that started me to thinking: can religion be taught without teaching bigotry
    as well? if one teaches, for example, that having a particular faith makes one
    a better person, is the teacher not also implying that the non-believer is an
    inferior one? an experienced and motivated teacher might be able to do so, but
    how many parents or members of the clergy have both the will and the skill to
    do so? teaching "tolerance" alone is inadequate in that it still implies that
    the other fellow is wrong, but should be tolerated anyway, i.e., forgive his ignorance.
    as long as the "true believer" is taught that he is in any way superior to the
    non-believer, he is well on his way to becoming a qualified bigot, religious fanatic,
    or member of one of the many hate groups that have been spawned by such teachings
    through the ages. to the extent that your column encourages readers to think for
    themselves and to realize that there is nothing more wrong than self-righteousness,

    handsome, expensive fountain pen, emerald in color and trimmed in gold. then,

    asked permission to come to my home the following weekend. i refused, agreeing
    instead to meet her at a local coffee shop. abby, diane is an adoptee who recently
    located and met her birth mother. she told me that my father was also her father,
    which makes her my half-sister! she said her mother had told her that she and
    my father had been lovers for the last two years of his life. she said her mother
    never told her lover (dad) that she was pregnant, and she (diane) was given up
    for adoption when she was 5 days old! i told her that i did not take any stock
    in secondhand information- that i needed concrete proof in writing. she had none.
    however, she described my father''s physical appearance accurately, knew the names
    of his friends, the branch of service he had been in, and she correctly detailed
    the circumstances of his accidental death, which occurred some years ago. i asked
    diane what she wanted of me and my family. she said: "nothing. i just want to
    know something about my family, and perhaps see some photographs of my blood relatives."
    abby, i was prepared to meet a kook or a con artist. instead, i found her to be
    a very gentle, decent person. now i am totally confused about what to do. at this
    point, i don''t want to tell anyone else. (i am thankful she didn''t contact my
    mother.) at the end of our meeting, she said, " `our'' father has been dead for
    a long time. whom would we be hurting by knowing each other?" abby, i am wondering
    if there is some kind of physical test that could either prove or disprove these
    allegations? if this woman is really my half-sister, is there any way to verify
    it? no name or city, please'

    i have been going with a divorced man for the last three years. for the first
    year and a half he was living with a girl, then she moved out of the state. when
    she moved out, i moved in and have been staying at his house ever since. my problem
    is that he wants to remain friends with his "ex," which is ok with me, but he
    lies to her. when she calls and asks if he''s seeing anyone, he says, "no." once
    when i answered the phone and she asked him who i was, he said, "it''s the maid."
    i am sick of being hidden from his "ex." (he tells me not to make any noise when
    he''s on the phone with her.) what can i do to stop him from hiding me and lying
    to her? back-street girlfriend'

    two years ago, i ran into an old acquaintance from high school, and she invited
    me to lunch. we started having lunch together about twice a month. i enjoyed it
    at first, but soon noticed that she did nothing but complain. we are both 42,
    which she considers "over the hill." she is married to a lovely man, has money
    and wonderful children who have never given her any trouble, but she''s envious
    of all of her friends-this one''s new car and that one''s recent trip, although
    she wants for nothing. she constantly whines about growing "old." i had many problems
    in my younger years, and i found happiness late in life. i think 42 is a wonderful
    age. my problem: how do i get rid of this woman? i have been very patient, but
    i just can''t take her negative, complaining attitude any longer. after lunch
    with her, i feel anything but good. deflated'

    i thought it was extremely tacky of him to ask me to return these gifts, my first

    done with as painlessly and quickly as possible. then, the more i thought about

    i have a charming australian boyfriend (i''ll call him aussie). we''ve been together

    man. aussie never bothered to get a divorce. three years later, aussie moved to
    london where he became involved with a south american woman whose visa was about
    to expire, so he married her so she could stay in england. a year later, they
    separated, and aussie figured he was already in such a mess, why bother with a
    divorce. so, he lost track of her, too. now 11 years after aussie''s first wife
    left him, she contacted his mother, saying she needs a divorce because she has
    met a fine australian gentleman who wants to marry her. my aussie is thrilled

    i''ll make an honest effort to quit. if i''m overweight, i''ll eat nothing i know
    to be fattening. and i will force myself to exercise -- even if it''s only walking
    around the block or using the stairs instead of the elevator. just for today i''ll
    do something i''ve been putting off for a long time. i''ll finally write that
    letter, make that phone call, clean that closet or straighten out those dresser
    drawers. just for today, before i speak i will ask myself, "is it true? is it
    kind?" and if the answer to either of those questions is negative, i won''t say
    it. just for today i will make a conscious effort to be agreeable. i will look
    as good as i can, dress becomingly, talk softly, act courteously and not interrupt
    when someone else is talking. just for today i''ll not improve anybody except
    myself. just for today i will have a program. i may not follow it exactly, but
    i will have it, thereby saving myself from two pests: hurry and indecision. just
    for today i will gather the courage to do what is right and take the responsibility
    for my own actions. to one and all: have a happy, healthy new year. and to ensure
    a happy new year for everyone else, if you''re driving, don''t drink, and if you''re
    drinking, don''t drive. have a designated driver or take a cab. -- love, abby

    six years ago, my husband and i went to the netherlands to celebrate our 35th
    wedding anniversary. we had planned and saved for the trip for many years. another
    married couple, our best friends, were going with us. my mother had had several
    operations for cancer, but her doctor said she could live another six months to
    a year. you can probably guess what happened. we went off on this trip, and the
    second week of our holiday i got a call from my brother telling me that mom was
    in the hospital, but he didn''t think i should cut my trip short and come home.
    i did not go home, but my mother took a sudden turn for the worse and died the
    next day. we had taken a weekend side trip and missed the telephone message giving
    us the news, so i missed my mother''s funeral. a day has not gone by that i haven''t
    wept bitter tears and asked god to forgive me. my mother had sacrificed so much
    for me, and i wasn''t even there to pay my last respects. just writing this has
    helped, but i still feel guilty. maybe this will help others. have you any words
    of comfort for me? -- sorry and sad'

    (his cholesterol level and blood pressure could also be included here.) and, because
    studies have shown that there is definitely a connection between breast cancer

    may i add a few words to the letter from "one hopeless guy" who decided to chew
    tobacco instead of smoke it? let me tell you what "dipping snuff" will do to you:
    the nicotine from the tobacco seeps into your bloodstream, causing the arteries
    to constrict. the blood platelets become sticky, while the heart starts to pound.
    since the heart is beating faster through narrowing arteries, the blood pressure
    rises, increasing the chances of heart disease and stroke. while all of this is
    going on, the tobacco that has been stuffed between the cheek and gums is leaving
    a white lesion -- a precancerous condition that becomes malignant in from 3 percent
    to 5 percent of the cases. your teeth will scream for a dentist, not to mention
    the fact that your chances for developing cancer of the lip, nasal sinus, pharynx,
    larynx and esophagus also increase. your sense of taste and smell are diminished,
    which could result in the excessive use of salt, putting you at risk for high
    blood pressure and/or kidney disease. also, too much sugar may invite dental problems.
    i know this is not pleasant, abby, but people who dip snuff need to know the facts.

    with all this talk about condoms, there''s not a word about how to dispose of
    them safely. are we assuming that condoms are used only in the privacy of one''s
    own bedroom? or do we see the real world and know that they are used anywhere
    and everywhere? no mention is ever made of sanitary disposal. to a casual stroller,
    it would seem that accepted disposal is gravity. a walk in the park, and guess
    what? your toddler just picked up an interesting little item. or one cuts through

    please, can''t we protect others from the very thing the condom user is protecting
    himself from? as the mother of a toddler 40 years ago, i was appalled when she
    found a "balloon" and was blowing it up! with the enormous increase in demand,
    condom manufacturers can well afford individual packages that unfold to make a

    this is in reference to "in a quandary" -- the person who saw an older woman who

    our daughter, "naomi," who is 8 years old, has been taking piano lessons for three
    years. in recent months she seems to have lost interest in the piano, and it''s
    a struggle to get her to practice. i usually lose my temper, and she ends up in
    tears. i finally gave up trying to force her to practice. my theory is that unless
    she is motivated by her own desire to learn, it''s not worth the hassle -- not
    to mention the money we''re wasting on lessons. my husband disagrees. he thinks
    we should make naomi practice no matter how much she hates it. i should also mention
    that our son, "david," who is now 13, was allowed to quit taking violin lessons
    three months ago because of his many school obligations, plus making the football
    team -- which his father wholeheartedly approved of. naomi is angry. she can''t
    understand why we let her brother quit his music lessons, but we are not allowing
    her to quit. what do you think, abby? if you have a solution my husband will listen
    to, perhaps we can have some peace in this house. -- fighting in florida'

    i had to write in response to "a very disappointed trampoline owner" who was upset
    because he had to buy more insurance to cover himself if he was sued by neighbors
    whose kids sneaked into his yard and jumped on his trampoline. you suggested he
    build a fence and put a lock on it so children couldn''t use the trampoline unless
    they were supervised. abby, if "disappointed" wanted to give his children a fun
    toy, he may as well have given them a chain saw, because a trampoline is no less
    dangerous. supervision doesn''t ensure safety. my sister is a quadriplegic today
    because of a trampoline mishap she had years ago. she was a trained college gymnast
    who had spotters watching her when she did a back flip on the trampoline and broke
    her neck! she never left the trampoline, or hit the sides. "disappointed" is afraid
    an unsupervised child will get hurt and sue him. what happens if his own children
    get hurt? there will be no one to blame but himself. if he really loves his children,
    he''ll get rid of the trampoline. you may use my name. -- jenifer woetzel, welch,

    i can certainly sympathize with "pressured in pennsylvania" who wanted a "no-child"
    wedding. all of the invitations to my daughter''s wedding last month were worded
    in the correct way and addressed to "mr. and mrs." we assumed that by not including
    "and family," we would have no trouble. wrong! friends whom we had not seen in
    a number of years, and would have welcomed with open arms, announced that they
    were coming 500 miles to the wedding and bringing their married daughter (who
    was invited) and her three small children (who were definitely not invited!).
    it fell to me to telephone long-distance and tell them that the children were
    not included in the invitation. they said they had never heard of such a thing,
    and if the children weren''t welcome, they wouldn''t be coming either. i stood
    my ground and said i was sorry, but that''s the way it was. they never came. also,
    my daughter and i spent an entire weekend calling people who had failed to rsvp.
    a number of them told us they thought that if they were not planning to attend,
    they did not need to respond. (what did they think the stamp on the return envelope
    was for?) several accepted but never showed up. abby, i think it''s time to change
    the rules. tacky or not, if i ever have to do this again, i will state on the
    invitations: "sorry, adults only. "please respond with a yes or no. a stamped
    envelope is included for your convenience." and finally, the ultimate in tacky:
    "no-shows will be billed for the amount charged per person, by the caterer." (in
    our case, it was $30 per head, and we were out several hundred dollars and a lot
    of food went to waste because of those thoughtless people.) thank you for listening

    we would like to pass along a family tradition we started some years ago. a few
    days after each christmas and birthday, we go through our daughter kristin''s
    toys. with her help, we decide which toys she doesn''t play with -- or has outgrown

    our own child the joy of sharing. so instead of selling those old but good-as-new

    i''ve never written to you, but a recent letter in your column has motivated me
    to share my experience with tattoos. some parents were concerned that their bright,
    responsible daughter had "betrayed" her decent parents'' beliefs and values by
    getting a tattoo. i, too, was a popular, bright high school student. i was class
    valedictorian, president of the national honor society and a national merit scholar.
    i had my choice of colleges and scholarships, and initially chose a small, church-affiliated
    college. i later transferred to a large state university where i graduated with
    a 4.0 grade-point average and was elected to phi beta kappa. after leaving graduate
    school, i worked as a volunteer teacher for vista (the domestic branch of the
    peace corps), then i became a federal law enforcement agent and have been in that
    career for the last 16 years. i am married and have three wonderful children and
    am active in my church. and guess what? when i was 24, i got a tattoo! a rather
    small one in a relatively private place. i think tattoos are fascinating and would
    have another one were i not concerned about contracting hepatitis or some other
    disease from a dirty needle. i have had that tattoo for 15 years and do not regret
    it or suffer any embarrassment because of it. i got it for myself, not for public
    display -- although those who see it may get a clue to the "inner me" not normally
    revealed to the casual acquaintance. thanks for being an open forum, abby. --

    announced that he tested positive for the aids virus, we have been hearing a great
    deal about aids. it is no longer "a gay disease," and as johnson said, "if it
    could happen to me -- it can happen to anybody." please read what anna quindlen,
    the brilliant new york times columnist, had to say about the subject: "in the
    10 years since five gay men with pneumonia became a million people who are hiv-positive,
    this illness has brought out the worst in america. "last year we witnessed the
    canonization of one aids patient, a 23-year-old woman named kimberly bergalis,
    who says she ''didn''t do anything wrong.'' she is a lovely white woman with no
    sexual history who contracted aids from her dentist. she is what some people like
    to call ''an innocent victim.'' "with that single adjective we condemn those who
    get aids from sex and those who get it from dirty needles as guilty, and ultimately
    unworthy of our help and sympathy. we imply that gay men get what they deserve,
    and people who shoot up may as well be dead. it''s a little like being sympathetic
    to the health-conscious jogger who dies of a heart attack during a stint on the
    stairmaster, but telling the widow of the couch potato, ''well, if he hadn''t
    eaten all those hot dogs, this wouldn''t have happened.'' "how are all those parents
    who denigrate ''queers'' and ''junkies'' going to explain what happened to magic
    johnson? how are all those pious people who like to talk about ''innocent victims''
    going to deal with the lovable basketball star, the all-time sports hero, who
    stressed safe sex when he told the world he was hiv-positive? will this finally
    make them say to their kids, ''it could happen to you,'' and make them stop relying
    solely on chastity and start dealing with reality? "magic johnson, with that engaging
    personality, that athletic legerdemain, that grin -- this is what aids looks like.
    why can''t we learn to deal with our national tragedy with as much dignity and
    determination as this good man brings to his personal one?"'

  body: 'dear readers: well, it seems as though we just finished polishing off the
    thanksgiving leftovers, and it''s time to start shopping for holiday gifts again.
    you may consider spending less on gifts this year and doing a little more for
    the poor and homeless. however, old habits are hard to break, so if you insist
    on sending gifts, let me tell you what not to give aunt sylvia and uncle howard,
    who don''t get around much anymore. forget the cologne, dusting powder and after-shave.
    they probably have several unopened boxes on their closet shelves -- that is,
    if they haven''t already recycled them. grandpa doesn''t need another necktie,
    and grandma doesn''t want any more earrings. with the price of groceries going
    through the roof, older people who live alone on fixed incomes would appreciate
    a basket of practical goodies. how about small tins of tuna, chicken and ham?
    also, crackers, instant coffee, tea, soup mixes and cookies. people who live in
    confined quarters do not need more "things," so don''t send candy dishes or figurines.
    and don''t send articles of clothing unless you''re sure the size is right. leisure
    (or "warm-up") suits are comfy and easy to launder. older folks love them. some
    truly useful gifts: an assortment of postcards, some lined stationery with envelopes
    and a generous supply of postage stamps. and enclose some felt-tip pens. another
    suggestion: a variety of greeting cards for all occasions. they might want to
    send someone a nice birthday, anniversary, graduation or thank-you card. don''t
    forget get-well cards, condolence cards and "congratulations on the new baby"
    cards. should you be tempted to recycle a lovely but useless gift still in its
    original box, make sure the card to you is not still in the box. never give a
    pet to anyone unless you are absolutely certain that person wants a pet and is
    able to care for it properly. and if you want to make a hit with someone who has
    a pet, send a little holiday gift for it (a tin of dog or cat food and bird seed
    for "tweetie pie") along with a gift for its master. don''t give wine or liquor
    to people unless you are sure they imbibe. a thoughtful idea: a gift subscription
    for a magazine or newspaper you know they will enjoy. candy, nuts and fruitcake
    make beautiful gifts for people who aren''t counting their calories, but have
    a little compassion for those who are, and lead them not into temptation. also
    bear in mind that some older folks have difficulty chewing nuts and caramels.
    another good idea for those living alone on a fixed income: a gift certificate
    for some kind of service such as window washing, carpet cleaning, taxi rides,
    barber shop, beauty parlor or dinner or lunch at their favorite place. and (don''t
    laugh) a gift certificate entitling them to a trip to the podiatrist. because
    medication is no small item these days, a gift certificate from the neighborhood
    pharmacy would be very much appreciated. trust me. holiday time can be depressing
    for people who are alone, so if you know someone who might be alone and lonely,
    give him (or her) the best gift of all -- an invitation to have a holiday meal
    with you and your family. loneliness is the ultimate poverty. -- love, abby'

    i would dearly love to see the inside of the homes where my grandmother and parents
    lived when i was a child. they were farmhouses with no indoor plumbing and, at
    one time, no electricity. i understand that my grandmother''s house has been completely
    modernized, and i can see from the outside that an addition has been built onto
    it. my question: would it be out of line for me to go to the door, identify myself,
    and ask to be taken on a tour of the house? i can''t call ahead to make an appointment
    because i don''t know who lives there. also, i''m always on vacation when i''m
    in the area, and i can''t make an appointment for the next week or month. this
    is rural country; people are not as fearful of strangers as they might be in the
    city, and i can tell them enough about their house to convince them that i once
    lived there. i have asked a few friends what they would do if a stranger came
    to their door and asked permission to see their house. some said they would permit
    entry. others said, "no way!" abby, please ask your readers what they would say.

    this is the first time that i have written to you. maybe you won''t think this

    i am a 35-year-old single (by choice) woman, and after 20 years of dating, i have
    come to the conclusion that my mother was wrong when she said, "a lady never calls
    a gentleman -- she waits for him to call her." too many times i''ve had a man
    ask for my phone number, then i''d wait impatiently for him to call me. sometimes
    he''d call, yet there were times when he never followed through. then i''d agonize
    over what i might have done wrong. when a woman meets a man she''d like to see
    again, and he takes her number, why shouldn''t she feel free to take his, too,
    so if he doesn''t call her, she can call him? i recently met a very attractive
    man and we seemed to hit it off very well, but instead of his taking my number
    and saying the usual "i''ll call you," he gave me his number and asked me to call
    him. perfect! i had the option either to call him or not -- it was all up to me.
    i liked that. don''t get me wrong; i''m not on a power trip. i still like doors

    and make a mental note of all those blessings for which we can be thankful. how
    is your health? you have a few minor complaints? well, thank god they''re not
    major. if you''re reading this -- you''re still here. you can probably think of
    at least one person who isn''t around this year. (i know i can.) if you awakened
    this morning and were able to hear the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter
    human sounds, read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one) -- praise the
    lord! a lot of people couldn''t. (say a prayer for those who have perished --
    from natural causes, fire, flood, earthquake or war.) how''s your pocketbook?
    thin? you''re not alone. but many people in much of the world are a lot poorer
    and have far less hope than we have in america. are you lonely? well, the way
    to have a friend is to reach out to someone and try to be a friend. if nobody
    calls you, call someone. go out of your way today to do something nice for another
    person. it''s a sure cure for the blues. are you concerned about your country''s
    future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern -- concern for fair
    treatment under the law. our country may not be a rose garden, but it is far from
    a patch of weeds. freedom rings! look and listen. you can worship in the church
    of your choice (or not worship at all if that''s your choice), cast a secret ballot
    and even criticize our government without fear of retribution. and for the first
    time, we are living in a unipolar world free from the threat of impending nuclear
    disaster. as a final thought i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer. perhaps you
    will want to use it at your table tomorrow -- let one of the children read it:
    "o, heavenly father, we thank thee for food and remember the hungry. "we thank
    thee for health and remember the sick. "we thank thee for friends and remember
    the friendless. "we thank thee for freedom and remember the enslaved. "may these
    remembrances stir us to service, "that thy gifts to us may be used for others.
    amen." may the spirit of thanksgiving be shared by one and all! have a wonderful
    thanksgiving, and may god bless you and yours. -- love, abby p.s. why not invite
    a friend who lives alone to share a thanksgiving meal -- or better yet, call and
    say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." try it, and let
    me know how your day was.'

    her wedding was scheduled to be a month later. all the preparations were made

    is the intended bride supposed to return all the shower gifts? or are they hers

    my parents have been married for 16 years. i am 21. my first mother died. mom
    and dad have always had a trusting relationship. mom has been working for a law
    firm for the past seven years. lately she''s been spending a lot of time with
    her boss. it''s gotten to the point where "pete" -- her boss -- will pick her
    up and drive her to work every morning, then he brings her home after she has
    worked late. they go out to lunch together nearly every day. for the past two
    weeks, mom has worked late every night and she''s gone in on saturday to "help
    him out." pete is married, too. yesterday he gave her a single long-stemmed rose.
    i don''t dare say anything to either of my parents, so i''m asking for your advice.
    my younger brothers have both asked me if i thought something was going on between
    mom and her boss. i''ve always said, "no way," but now i think differently. i
    hate feeling this way. i love both my parents dearly, but i think mom is taking
    advantage of dad''s trust in her. what should i do? -- confused daughter'

    after reading the letter you printed concerning all the wonderful benefits of
    hugging, i had to write to express a contrary opinion. except for my husband,
    small children and animals, i am a person who does not like to be touched, and
    i think i have the right to feel that way. there is nothing wrong with me, and
    i am sure there are others who share my feelings. granted, a great many people
    feel that a hug can make their day, but a hug can ruin mine. occasionally someone
    i know only casually will hug and even kiss me, when i have given them absolutely
    no reason to believe i would welcome such familiarity. not wanting to appear rude,
    i grimace and bear it. i don''t know how this problem can be resolved, since apparently
    most people don''t object. but how is one supposed to know in advance that someone
    does not want to be hugged? however, once i inform a person that i don''t like
    to be touched, i would hope that my wishes will be respected. i have even thought
    of wearing a t-shirt with "thank you for not hugging me" across the front. any
    suggestions? just sign me ... hands off'

    people, for a number of reasons, put their ticket in their mouth to free up both

    or whatever. they do not consider that when they remove the ticket from their

    as clean as soap and water could get them." he then reluctantly blessed the food
    and began eating. the food was delicious, so he praised the hostess in spite of

    last friday, some friends and i went to a nightclub to listen to the band and

    i told him i wasn''t, and he said, "that''s great -- neither am i." i invited
    him to sit at our table, and i found him to be a really neat guy. at the end of
    the evening, bill said his ride home had left, so i gave him a ride home. he told
    me his roommate had guests over and he didn''t want to intrude, so we parked in
    front of his place and talked and kissed for nearly two hours. when we finally
    said goodbye, we had spent four beautiful hours together. before leaving, i gave
    him my phone number with high hopes of hearing from him. (he gave me no phone
    number.) a few days later, a friend who had been at the club when i first met
    bill told me that bill is a married man who lives with his wife and four children.

    my husband and i are separating after six years of marriage. i am 31 and he is
    33. after months of discussion and many sessions with a marriage counselor, we
    came to realize that we had no common goals. (he initiated the idea of separation
    after expressing a desire to be on his own again.) i have cried, bargained and
    offered to compromise, but his mind is made up; he wants his independence. i refuse
    to commit emotional blackmail or entrap him with a pregnancy to continue the marriage.
    therefore, i have decided the best thing to do is let him go. it hurts, but this
    way we can part as friends and get on with our lives. our problem: how to explain
    this to our families, friends and co-workers who have always viewed us as the
    "perfect couple." we rarely fought. we trusted each other, supported each other''s
    careers, shared the work and had fun together. no one would suspect that we''ve
    been talking about separating for the past four months. it will be a shock to
    our families and a total surprise to everyone else. abby, we want to be truthful
    and call it a mutual decision, but i know people will look for something more
    scandalous than incompatibility as soon as this spreads via the grapevine. how
    do we maximize understanding and minimize rumor fallout? -- d.j., illinois'

    to "any serviceperson" and sent it to the persian gulf as a part of your letter-writing
    campaign. i never really expected a reply, but i received one from a lt. patrick
    e. fortune, which i answered promptly. we soon learned that we had a lot in common:
    his name is patrick, my name is patty; he''s irish-catholic, i''m irish-catholic;
    he''s one of seven kids, i''m one of seven kids; he went to an all-boys catholic
    school, i went to an all-girls catholic school; we both have dreamed of biking
    through ireland. we also share many of the same beliefs about god, family and
    values. when pat returned to the states, we started talking on the telephone.
    we have had three- and four-hour long conversations. (don''t ask about our telephone
    bills!) i finally broke down and told him that i was absolutely nuts about him!
    he then confessed that he felt the same way about me. we finally met in cincinnati
    over the labor day weekend and had a sensational time. we knew there was no doubt
    about it -- we were right for each other. pat sent me a plane ticket so i could
    visit him at fort bragg, and our romance flourished. he will get out of the service
    in about six months, after which he plans to move to milwaukee and make spoiling
    me a full-time job. that''s wonderful because he''s the most important person

    has never been married, and my best friend is a married woman with two children.
    her husband''s job allows him to be home only three nights a week. i even stay
    at her home about 50 percent of the time. her husband has no objections to my
    staying in their home. in fact, we get along very well. the problem is that everyone
    thinks it is abnormal for us to "hang out" as much as we do. we do not have sex,
    and never will; we are not attracted to each other sexually at all. we are just
    good friends and that''s all. so, what do you think, abby? is our relationship
    normal or not? i hope you will print this so our friends will know that two people
    of the opposite sex can be good friends -- and that''s all. -- bugged in barstow'

    our 17-year-old daughter, "marcie," is going steady with "brad." they are both
    seniors in high school. during marcie''s junior year, she ran with the wrong crowd,

    very honest with brad, and now he is being verbally abusive -- throwing her past
    in her face and making her feel like dirt. she quit smoking and drinking, but
    there''s nothing she can do about her virginity. after being with brad, she comes
    home and cries because he makes her feel so cheap and dirty. they fight all the

    will you please ask your readers never to interrupt a police officer in the middle
    of a traffic stop unless it is a dire emergency? (directions to the nearest restaurant
    don''t count!) abby, we police officers never know who we are pulling over during
    a routine stop. it could be a murderer, an escaped felon or a minister. more law
    enforcement personnel are injured or killed during routine traffic stops than
    almost any other type of police activity. (it''s twice as dangerous at night.)
    please don''t pull up right next to me as i''m approaching the car i just stopped
    and ask me for directions! we could both be in danger and i might not be able
    to guarantee your safety. we also make stops where the element of danger is known
    beforehand -- such as an armed robber fleeing the scene. this is usually a planned
    stop where suspects are taken out of a car at gunpoint. if you should see one
    or more police officers with their guns drawn and pointed at someone, don''t walk
    up and ask, "what''s going on?" we are not filming "t.j. hooker." if a police
    officer is all red in the face and yelling at you and waving an arm in a sideways
    motion while holding a gun in the other, don''t wave back. it isn''t a greeting.
    move! you are in the line of fire! thanks, abby, for letting me get this off my

    sometimes i think that the u.s. postal service is its own worst enemy. they came
    out with a five-digit zip code which the public finally accepted (after a lot
    of grumbling). but right on top of that, they reduced the state abbreviations
    to only two characters which makes them very, very confusing. and now, four more
    zip code digits have been added! abby, ask people who don''t come from these nine
    states the following questions: is "ma" maine, maryland or massachusetts? is "ne"
    nevada or nebraska? is "al" alaska or alabama? is "ms" mississippi or missouri?
    i have recently had five mailings returned by the u.s. postal service because
    the address on the envelope had no apartment number on it. if the people who gave
    me their address did not include an apartment number, i have to address their
    mail as i see it. why put the onus on me? people tend to ignore decisions they
    feel are wrong and that they had no choice in making. maybe they hope that the
    rules will be modified. -- hopeful in daytona beach'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    after reading your article about people who are afraid of pets, i had to write.
    i have dogs, cats and also snakes -- all boa constrictors. while i was growing
    up, my brothers would come in from working the fields and get a big kick out of
    throwing snakes on me. i made up my mind i wasn''t going to be afraid, so i studied
    up on snakes and learned everything i could about them -- that''s how i started
    keeping snakes as pets. now i''m invited to bring my snakes to schools and talk
    to children so they can decide for themselves whether snakes are good or bad.
    snakes make loving pets. i took my 6 1/2-foot boa constrictor everywhere with
    me until she got so big i could no longer sneak her into my blouse. boa constrictors
    are non-poisonous. they''re intelligent, too. when i ask for a kiss, she kisses
    me on the corner of my mouth. once, when she was on the couch with me, she heard
    someone coming into the house through the sliding glass door -- so she went right
    after him! (afterward, the police refused to come in to make the report.) dogs
    intimidate people by growling and showing their teeth, but most folks are terrified
    at the sight of a snake! snakes are much easier to care for than a dog or cat.
    they eat only once every eight or 10 days, and they''re not slimy like most people
    think -- they''re smooth and silky. before closing, i want to commend you for
    telling the reader who was terrified to discover a snake coiled up in the corner
    of her attic, "why kill it? people don''t realize that snakes eat mice and rats,
    and they''re good for the environment." -- karen small'

    regarding the letter from the "mother of girls" about topless bathing suits for

    men and women. some just happen to be bigger than others. the "low" in our civilization

    that nudity is nasty. in a world where horrible crimes against humanity are committed

    hooray for cora laird of iowa who complained about how difficult it is to hear

    -- background music. (in some cases i have concluded the dialogue is secondary
    to the music, since there is no way i can hear what is being said!) i also wear
    a hearing aid. your suggestion to write to the various sponsors was a bit impractical,
    since in a two-hour show there are approximately seven breaks with eight or nine
    commercials, plus tv ads in each one. besides, the commercials are not the main
    problem -- i just hit the mute button; it''s trying to hear the show itself. the
    only way to reach the "powers that be" is through your column. a letter would
    not carry the clout your column does. if they would put filters in their ears,

    there are about 20 million people in the united states with some degree of hearing
    loss -- also millions of recent immigrants still struggling to learn english.
    in addition, there are millions of adults who are learning disabled, or simply
    never learned to read. what do they all have in common? they can all benefit from
    closed-captioned television. the problem: very few of them realize they can be
    helped by closed-captions, let alone own the caption decoder needed to decode
    the otherwise invisible subtitle-like captions that are broadcast with many television
    shows, and recorded with many home rental video movies. (contrary to popular belief,
    closed-captions are not just for deaf and hard-of-hearing people.) the good news:
    many people who become deaf early in life own a caption decoder. the national
    captioning institute claims that half the caption decoders sold were sold to hispanic
    and asian americans who find it easier to understand new idioms and strange english
    expressions when they can read and hear the words at the same time. the bad news:
    people who lose their hearing late in life either don''t know about closed-captions,
    or consider "dependency" on captions as a sign of aging. more good news: starting
    july 1, 1993, all television sets 13 inches or larger made or sold in the united
    states will have a closed-caption decoder built inside! abby, please educate your
    readers and encourage them to turn on the decoder at all times if they have children
    at home who are reading at or below fourth-grade level. that little decoder chip
    inside the television set may help put a permanent dent in the illiteracy rates

    thank you for many years of sensible, down-to-earth answers to problems that may
    or may not have entered my life -- they were enlightening anyway. now for my silly
    problem. my husband and i (70ish) recently took a trip in our rv and stopped at
    a favorite restaurant in pennsylvania that serves "family style." in other words,
    platters of food are on the table for all to share. upon leaving, i visited the
    ladies room, and since the woman attendant was bustling around the lavatories,
    i skipped washing my hands, intending to do so in the rv. i was shocked when the
    attendant stopped me and asked if i was entering the dining room. i said, "no,
    i''m leaving." it was very embarrassing, to say the least. i''ve heard of "potty
    parity" -- what is this? "potty police"? is this custom prevalent? -- red-faced

    can you stand one more story about a phony money-making scheme? my mother, a widow
    who lives on her social security, received a telephone call advising her that
    she had won three prizes -- an automobile, $10,000 in diamonds, and her choice
    of a vacation in hawaii, california or florida! well, mama thought she had died
    and gone to heaven! the man on the phone told her that all she had to do was let
    them send her their "products" to try; the products were free, but she had to
    pay for shipping, handling and insurance, which was "only $699.99." then the caller
    asked mother if she had either mastercard or visa. she said she had mastercard.
    so she was asked to give him her card number. she became suspicious and hung up!
    the man called her back saying, "we must have been disconnected." then mother
    said, "i''m sorry, i was advised never to give my credit card number to anyone
    on the telephone." she then hung up and immediately called the better business
    bureau to report this company. she was thanked, and then told that they already
    had the name of this company on file! abby, please run this in your column. there
    are still plenty of people who might fall for this kind of scam. -- no fool in

    i have a big problem. i am getting married on nov. 23. my fiance and i are having
    a wedding reception with more than 200 guests. there are no children invited.
    according to the etiquette books that i have read, it is not proper to put "no
    children" on your wedding invitations. (mine are already printed up the proper
    way.) anyway, one of my aunts is upset because her son and his wife have a 2-year-old
    boy who has cerebral palsy and some mental retardation. they claim that they cannot
    get a baby sitter for the boy and that they are bringing him to the wedding. they
    brought him to a family wedding last year, and everyone was buzzing about it.
    i don''t understand why they can''t get a sitter. they have plenty of time to
    find one. and i don''t want you to think that we don''t want the boy there because
    he has a disability. (my fiance also has a physical disability.) but it is not
    fair to my fiance''s family, some of whom have small children, too. how do i handle
    this? i have already told my aunt "no" in so many words. she''s one of those hardheaded
    people who wants her way all the time, and i am determined that she is not going
    to win this time. i don''t even understand why she is getting involved when it
    is her son and daughter-in-law''s place to talk to me about it. -- pressured in

    in response to "ellen," whose 75-year-old friend was out $4,000 (her credit cards
    were stolen and she was duped by a phone call into not reporting it), and anyone
    else who has in their possession even one credit card: read your credit agreement!
    your maximum liability for unauthorized use is $50 per credit card. prompt reporting
    also helps, as you cannot be charged for any purchases made with that card after
    you have notified the card issuer. that could mean even less than $50. the sob
    stories about people who have lost "thousands," with all due respect to this elderly
    woman, make me ill. was she carrying 80 cards? otherwise, her liability could
    nowhere approach $4,000. more likely, she just didn''t know her rights and responsibilities.
    and shame on ellen for merely reporting her plight instead of finding out what
    her friend''s rights were. also, those other "wonderful" folks who offer (for
    a sizable fee) to keep records of all your credit cards and notify the issuer
    if the cards are lost or stolen are a rip-off. you can do the same thing yourself
    for nothing if you''ll just keep a record of each card number and the telephone
    number to call in the event of loss, etc. the numbers are usually toll-free and
    are printed on your credit agreement and on the card itself. just make sure you
    write it down and file it, because you won''t have the card to refer to after
    it''s stolen. -- home economist in woodridge, ill.'

    your letters from women who are "faking it" to satisfy their husbands are hilarious!
    but there is definitely another side to the story. for 48 years i was married
    to a wonderful woman. every sexual encounter was an expression of love -- not
    lust. she initiated the activity as often as i did. then she suffered a paralyzing
    stroke, so for seven years i bathed her daily and cuddled her as i laid beside
    her as her beautiful body withered away. our love did not require the sexual act;
    holding her in my arms was all i needed. she has been gone for two years, and
    no one could ever take her place. i am a shriveled 76-year-old man and certainly
    nothing to look at. last year i joined a senior citizens group, and you would
    think i am clark gable! widows swarmed like flies to garbage! the first woman
    i danced with outweighed me by 100 pounds and wanted to "dirty dance" with me.
    the first night i had three invitations to spend the night. i never went to another
    meeting, but i''ve gone on overnight trips with the group. abby, women knocked
    on my bedroom door! if you could see me you would know how hard up they must be.
    i would like to find a woman for companionship, and possibly later on sex might
    enter the picture. but every woman i''ve met -- even in church -- makes advances.

    sex maniacs as soon as their husbands are gone? -- no bargain in minnesota'

    i am a secretary and have been for some years now. but recently, i started working
    with a new company, and i have one major problem with one of the higher authorities
    (who isn''t my boss/supervisor) who uses me as her personal secretary -- and i
    do mean personal. she has me doing her income taxes, her daughter''s income taxes,
    her lease, etc., and making coffee. the last duty is extremely irksome. yes, i
    am supposed to assist her, as directed by my boss. but he means as an aide, not
    a maid. i do not like coffee, therefore i don''t drink it -- so why do i have
    to make it? i really don''t think coffee-making is in any secretarial job description.
    i really would like to tell her to do her own personal things and make her own
    coffee, but she''s very sneaky and i fear she might go behind my back and tell
    my boss some off-the-wall story. how do i handle this without jeopardizing my
    job or any future references i may need when i decide to change jobs in the future?

    i need to settle a dispute concerning proper telephone etiquette. when someone
    telephones me and i am not at home, my brother asks if there is a message. if
    there isn''t one, he terminates the conversation. i say he should ask who is calling,
    so that i will, at least, know who called. as it stands, when i get home all i
    am told is, "someone called -- and he didn''t leave a message." my brother insists
    he has no right to ask more than, "do you care to leave a message?" he says it
    would be rude -- an invasion of privacy -- to ask more. i say it is acceptable
    to ask, and if the caller does not wish to leave his name, he can say no. who

    our 42-year-old son and his wife live in the same city with us. we never make
    demands on them and are self-sufficient and able to take care of our needs. we
    do, however, enjoy seeing them, and invite them to join us for dinner from time
    to time. they never drop in, but we would be delighted if they would. my husband
    and i never go to them uninvited, and they rarely invite us over. when friends
    or relatives visit us from out of town, we would like to include our son and his
    wife and ask them to share a meal. but when we do, they seem very annoyed and
    resentful and claim that our guests are ours, and they don''t want to be bothered.
    i occasionally coax them by telling them that if they would come, they are free
    to leave anytime and don''t have to give up the whole evening. i try to be thoughtful
    -- they call it "manipulative." it upsets us terribly that our adult son can''t
    understand that family relationships mean a lot to us, and we would be proud to
    have our friends and relatives meet him and his wife. when he and his brothers
    were growing up, our home was always open to all their friends. he is a nice and
    pleasant person, but he refuses to give of himself. we can''t seem to make him

    i am very angry! we have just met with our insurance agent who has advised us
    that we need an additional policy. we recently purchased a trampoline for our
    children, which we are now told is a huge liability to us. it stands about 3 1/2
    feet off the ground, so it is not likely that a small child could get on without
    assistance. what infuriates me is that the children who could get on are old enough
    to know they would be trespassing. should a child hurt him or herself while using
    it without supervision, we would be responsible. why couldn''t we sue the parents
    for not watching their children or teaching them to respect other people''s property?
    our system has made it a liability to drive the boy scouts to the zoo, or have
    play equipment in our own back yard. granted, laws are made for the protection
    of others -- but what about my rights? i could lose my home, my car and all of
    my savings because the newspaper boy decided to jump on our trampoline while delivering
    newspapers. we, the public, have made it so easy to sue. who cares? the insurance
    company has plenty of money. wrong! you and i pay for it through higher premiums.
    it is time the lawyers, judges and jurors stood up and shouted, "enough! quit
    wasting my time and the taxpayers'' money!" for crying out loud, america, use
    some common sense! all we wanted to do was give our children a fun toy -- not

    i never thought i would be writing to you. my wife, "annie," does not care for
    my family, so we spend every holiday with her family. she says my family lives
    "too far away" to visit, although hers lives only a few miles closer. annie and
    i are happy together, but shutting out my family completely is starting to bother
    me. i think of them on holidays and their birthdays and would like to share these
    times with them. i try to discuss this with annie, but she always says, "we''ll
    talk about it another time" -- then she always initiates sex. (i just realized
    this.) it does take my mind off the discussion for the time being. have you had

    is there a universal sign of apology? there are many universal rude gestures known
    by everyone, but i often wish i had a signal saying "i''m sorry." for example,
    if i were daydreaming at a red light and the driver behind me had to honk the
    horn, how could i let that driver know that i''m sorry? other examples: splashing
    someone on the sidewalk, or misjudging the distance in passing so the other driver
    had to slow down. perhaps this "i apologize" sign would work if you absentmindedly
    jostled another person in a multilingual area, and you weren''t sure which language
    to apologize in. if there isn''t such a sign, maybe you should invent one. you
    have enough readers. perhaps we could create a more polite environment. -- small

    my husband and i frequently entertain at home. we have a dog and a cat that we
    love like members of our family. when we have guests, we always confine our pets
    in another area before our guests arrive. many of our friends have told us that
    they appreciate this because they have a fear of dogs, or cats or both! our veterinarian
    told us that when some people say they "dislike" animals, they actually fear them.
    for example, if a person who is not used to having pets around entered someone''s
    house and was greeted at the door by a hostile dog barking angrily or a cat that
    curled around his leg, he could have an anxiety attack! i happen to have a terrible
    fear of snakes. i know that not all snakes are poisonous, but just the sight of
    a snake terrifies me. yet some people have snakes as pets -- but i cannot imagine
    a host or hostess allowing a pet snake to slither freely among the guests. well,
    the fear of dogs and cats is every bit as terrifying to some people as the fear
    of snakes is to me. our animal-loving friends didn''t believe us when we brought
    this up in conversation. they thought it was an exaggeration, but after questioning
    others whom they thought merely "disliked" animals, they finally admitted that
    they were actually afraid of them. what do you and your readers think? -- animal

    my friends and i have a problem with which we need help. we wear hearing aids,
    which makes it difficult to hear people talking on some of the television programs,
    as the background music and special sound effects are so overpowering, they drown
    out the voices. for example, in "jake and the fatman," the roar of the ocean is
    so loud it''s impossible to understand what the people are saying. it doesn''t
    help to turn the volume up, and we can''t do as president bush suggests: "read
    my lips." i love music, but loud background music is unnecessary on dramatic shows.
    commercials are a problem, too. they are so loud, they blast the hearing aids
    out of our ears. (have you ever tried turning a hearing aid down with barbecue
    sauce on your fingers?) the advertisers think they are getting our attention with
    the extra-loud commercial messages, but most people have remote-control sets,
    and they just shut the sound off until the program comes on again. are many of
    your readers experiencing the same problems? and who can we contact in the television
    industry to correct this? -- cora laird, fort dodge, iowa'

    what is happening to our society? where is taste? what about morals, decency and
    modesty? what kind of examples are we setting for our children? for example, i
    turned on the tv in the presence of my 11-year-old son and his 14-year-old sister,
    and what do we see? a sleepy-eyed, obviously naked lady in bed with a bedsheet
    around her, turning to her bed partner -- also naked. she asks, "what did you
    say your name was?" abby, is that the kind of message we should be sending to
    our young people -- that it''s ok to go to bed with strangers? that''s bad enough
    under any circumstances, but with the threat of aids, to make casual sex appear
    acceptable and commonplace is criminal. another thing: how about our movie stars
    proudly announcing that they are expecting a baby? the fact that they are not
    married -- and have no plans to marry at this time -- doesn''t seem to bother
    anybody. also, i''m not suggesting that we go back to the days when pregnant married
    women took their walks at night so nobody would see them, but i am not ready to
    see a pregnant woman in her eighth month stark naked on the cover of a magazine.

    my recent vacation trip has compelled me to pass along some tips to those who
    visit our precious national parks -- particularly yellowstone. 1. don''t bring
    your dog a1ong -- at least not to yellowstone; pets are not allowed past one-quarter
    of a mile on any trail there. i couldn''t believe all the dogs i saw locked in
    cars in 80-degree temperatures! better check the pet regulations of the park you
    plan to visit before deciding to bring your dog. (bears dislike dogs, so you''d
    be asking for trouble.) 2. extinguish your camp fires when you leave your site.
    3. if an animal wants to cross the road -- let it! you''re only a visitor -- the
    animal lives there, so be polite. (i couldn''t believe how many people i saw impatiently
    blowing their horns to force a buffalo or deer back to the side of the road.)
    4. those lovely wildflowers are not yours -- they belong to everyone; so please
    leave them there for the next person to admire. leave the rocks and stones in
    place, too. 5. if you want a close-up shot of an animal, invest in a camera with
    a zoom lens. i actually saw 25 or 30 people bounding across a meadow, surrounding
    a giant elk and snapping away within 50 feet of the beast. (do they think those
    animals are stuffed? if they ever get gored, they''ll find out.) 6. believe in
    signs. if you see a sign that says "danger" or "stay on trail" -- believe it.
    everyone acts like he''s working for national geographic. the best picture does
    not necessarily lie beyond the "no farther" warning. you''re better off settling
    for an ok shot than not living to see the shot of a lifetime. -- mary wieseman,

    calls are infrequent, and since he lives out of town, always long- distance. rather

    home?" daddy has been out of my life for a number of years, and i don''t always
    recognize his voice. these calls always catch me off guard, and i''m left wondering
    who wants to talk to my son without identifying himself first. junior was the
    result of love at one time, and he is the product of the woman his father hasn''t
    the common decency to say "hello" to -- ï¿½never mind a courteous, "how are you?"
    junior loves and respects mom, so why can''t daddy at least acknowledge her existence,
    and exercise the same good manners he presumably adopts when he calls his doctor''s
    office for an appointï¿½ment, or his girlfriend at her place of work, or his insurance
    agent? it''s such a small gesture in light of so many hurts after a divorce, and

    during the recent surge of patriotism, i have seen many t-shirts proclaiming support
    for u.s. troops in the persian gulf, american dominance and victory. i think there
    are many better ways to support our country and our troops than simply by putting
    a message on a t-shirt to tell everyï¿½body you love your country. for starters,
    don''t litter on the land you are proud of; keep it beautiful by picking up trash.
    if you are a student, study hard so you will be able to help your country compete
    in the world market. if you are employed, do a good job, and don''t cheat your
    employer. don''t shoplift; it puts retailers out of business and hurts the economy.
    if you are a defense contractor, don''t cheat the government -- ï¿½regardless
    of how easy they make it. write letters to your legislators telling them your
    views. how can they represent you if they don''t know what you want? you can bet
    that foreign interests and special interests are telling congress what they want.
    everyone who has the right to vote should vote. it''s a privilege. read the newspapers
    and watch the news to keep up on current events so you''ll know what''s going
    on. unless we want our servicepeople returning to the middle east, we must learn
    to conserve energy and reduce our oil dependence. some ways to do this are to
    "drive 55," carpool, select fuel-efficient cars and do not waste electricity.
    or is all of the above too much trouble? (it''s a lot easier to wear a t-shirt.)

    part of it if you agree with me. -- north carolina patriot'

    the way a truck driver is driving, so he''ll start playing games with him. i get

    i am 29 years old, have seven kids and am pregnant again. i''ve never been married,
    but i''ve been engaged twice and i''ve been pinned several times. don''t tell
    me i should have been more careful because i was careful, but nothing seemed to
    work with me. a doctor put me on birth control pills and i followed his instructions,
    but i turned up pregnant anyway. the dcotor said it must have been the fault of
    the pills, so he put me on another brand, and the same thing happened. i''ve used
    other methods including marking the calendar, but they all failed. i must be one
    of those super fertile types. i don''t want any more kids after this, at least
    not until i get married, but i don''t want an operation to make me sterile because
    i might meet a guy who wants a kid of his own, and then what will i do? is there
    a method of birth control that is positively sure? don''t send me to a doctor.

    i just read in a local newspaper that a clergyman urges a ban on babies attending
    church. after what happened at our church last sunday, i have to agree with him.
    today, parents dress up their kids real cute and take them to church to show them
    off, but they don''t discipline them. one little girl about 18 months old did
    everything but swing from the chandelier, and all her mother did was "shush" her
    by putting her fingers to her lips. her brother (about 8) kept stirring her up
    by poking her, and the mother just gave him a few dirty looks. another child sitting
    behind me kept trying to grab my earrings. when i turned around and glared, her
    mother just smiled. at one point, when announcements were made over the loudspeaker,
    there was so much commotion from kids yelling that no one could hear the announcements.
    the minister was disgusted, but he didn''t have the courage to say anything. he
    should have told the mothers of those unruly children to take them to the bathroom
    and give them a good learning experience! what do you think? i am ... hopping

    may i second your excellent recommendation to "nervous wreck," whose bull-headed
    husband refused marriage counseling, was walking all over her, and was teaching
    her son to do the same? we had a similar situation at our house. i finally sought
    counseling alone because my husband not only refused to go with me but also tried
    to talk me out of it. several sessions with a psychiatrist relieved my depression,
    and at the doctor''s suggestion i signed up for a course in assertiveness at a
    nearby mental health clinic. well, abby, our marriage is on an entirely different
    footing now. in counseling i was treated as a rational, sensitive person whose
    feelings are important, and i came to view myself that way. because i changed,
    my family''s reactions toward me did, too. they found that i would firmly reject
    disrespectful attitudes and actions and that i demanded my rights in any situation.
    my husband now seems like a different man, and we are both 100 percent happier.

    this is the second marriage for both of us. the problem is judy''s 16-year-old
    daughter, lynne. lynne told her mother that if she stayed married to me, she''d
    go live with her father. judy doesn''t want lynne to live with her father because
    he drinks. also, lynne threatened to get pregnant just for spite. judy insists
    that she loves me. she says she doesn''t want a divorce and the solution would
    be for me to move out and get a separate apartment near here for two years until
    lynne is 18. abby, i love judy more than any woman i''ve ever known, but what
    kind of marriage would we have living in separate apartments? please tell me what
    to do. -- unhappy in virginia'

    my husband and i have been invited to a wedding. my husband is unable to attend,
    so i am taking my 16-year-old cousin. she does not know the bride. at the last
    four weddings this cousin attended, she caught the bride''s bouquet. maybe i should
    tell you that she is a very large and athletic girl who is fast on her feet. i
    feel that because she is only 16 and has already caught four bouquets, she should
    not make an all-out effort to catch this one. don''t you think she should give
    the bride''s friends and relatives a chance to catch the bouquet? -- no bouquets
    for nora'

    i knew when i married my husband that his first love would always be horses. i
    never minded being second to a horse, but now i think a female biped has put me
    in third place. this woman is not married. she has horses of her own and she relies
    on my husband for help and advice about her horses. they seem to spend a lot of
    time together. i am invited to join them, but what fun is there for me when there
    is nothing but horse talk? people who know her say that she has no women friends,
    enjoys the company of men, but doesn''t want the responsibilities of marriage.
    i love my husband too much to leave him, but i was much happier before this horsey
    dame came along. my husband keeps telling me that i have nothing to worry about,
    but for the first time in my life i am jealous. please tell me what to do. --
    third place'

    i have been living with don for two years. i am 22 and he is 25. i hear girls
    at the office talking about bringing covered dishes to family gatherings, going
    to his folks'' or hers for dinner, or for the weekend or the holidays, and i get
    more heartsick every day. i''ve begun to realize what marriage is all about. it''s
    really belonging to someone who loves you enough to want to make you a member
    of his family. don is always telling me what a wonderful arrangement we have and
    how much he loves me. the past several months, i''ve been asking myself: "if it''s
    so wonderful and he loves me so much, why do we lie, sneak around and let people
    assume we are married?" why doesn''t he ask me to marry him and become a member
    of his family? they don''t even know i exist. -- heartsick'
