    i''m 13 and just finished the seventh grade. i recently got my belly button pierced,
    and everything was fine until about a week ago. this sounds weird, but a red bump
    showed up at the top of my piercing, and it seems to keep swelling. i''ve had
    my belly button pierced for only a month, so i''m sure i started changing my jewelry
    too soon. i''m worried this bump will stay on my navel forever. do you have any
    idea what it is, and how i can get rid of it? i love my piercing and don''t want
    to take it out. any information would help. -- pierced in montana'

    over the last two years i have lost 95 pounds. i did it by changing my lifestyle,
    exercising and making better food choices. my husband, "paul," insists that he
    shouldn''t have to hide his cookies, potato chips and chocolate candy, and says
    i should have self-control. i do have self-control, abby, but sometimes the temptation

    i''m 14, and i don''t wear shorts because i''m self-conscious about my legs. my

    one of mom''s girlfriends ask her why i don''t wear shorts, and what''s wrong
    with my legs? the next day, mom told me she was going to put on some shorts and
    how much cooler she felt. then she asked, "aren''t you hot in those jeans? you
    should start wearing shorts." today, mom had on some new shorts, and she said
    they were the most comfortable she had ever worn. then she handed me a bag with
    four pairs of shorts and told me, "i got you some, too." she told me to try on
    a pair. i told her i wasn''t wearing them. she yelled that i was being ridiculous
    to wear jeans in 95-degree weather. later, i got out of the shower and saw the

    i''m a single man in my mid-40s. my parents are gone, but seven of my 10 siblings
    are still alive. when i was 12, my appendix burst and i became deathly ill. the
    hospital visits took their toll on my dad, who suffered a major heart attack two
    weeks after i was released. two weeks after that, my father had another massive
    heart attack that ended his life. i felt extremely guilty. i thought i had killed
    my dad, so i turned to our parish priest for help. instead, he chose to molest
    me. he said i had made him do it, and i walked out of church feeling i was to
    blame -- that i was evil. from then on i trusted no one. i kept people at a distance.
    i have never had a close personal relationship or a romance. i have been seeing
    a wonderful counselor for seven years. she has helped me a lot, but i have resigned
    myself to being alone the rest of my life. abby, my siblings hate me -- i''m not
    sure why. they have birthday parties, graduation parties, backyard barbecues and
    many family-oriented gatherings to which i am never invited. we live in the same
    small town, so it''s not a matter of location. they go camping as a family in
    the summer, and it''s always kept a secret from me. when i ask why i wasn''t invited
    to the celebrations, i''m told that "there wasn''t enough room." when i ask about
    the camping trips, i''m told, "we don''t go camping as a family; we go as friends,
    so i''m sure you understand why you''re not invited." i really don''t understand.
    i think they get some kind of kick out of knowing how badly they hurt me. my counselor
    says i should walk away from them and not look back because what they''re doing
    is deliberate. but how can i walk away from the people who are supposed to love
    me unconditionally? i keep hoping one of them will realize how badly i am hurting,
    have some compassion and extend a loving embrace to me before i completely die
    on the inside. any advice would be greatly appreciated. -- a family of one in

    my 10-year-old daughter, "teddi," is extremely accident-prone and has been since
    she started walking. it has become a family joke that teddi can trip over air.
    she has fallen down stairs, tripped over a crack in the sidewalk, breaking her
    foot, and most recently, stepped on a rake and knocked out a tooth. how do i deal
    with her teachers and friends'' parents who look at me like i''m an abusive mother?
    my daughter always seems to have a bruise or cut somewhere. i have received my
    share of phone calls from concerned teachers, and each time i explain that teddi
    is very accident-prone. i love teddi and have taken every precaution i can to
    help her have fewer accidents, short of putting her in a bubble to protect her
    from herself. she has perfect vision and no balance issues. please advise me.

    my husband tells me my job as a wife is to obey him and be subservient. for the
    most part, i am. dinner is always on the table, the house is clean, the bills
    are paid, etc. all he has to do is go to work and take the trash out on sundays.
    i do everything else. if i disagree with anything he says, i''m told that i''m
    being a bad wife and mother for not obeying him. i am not allowed to work outside
    the home, although i have a nursing degree. he says marriage is a contract and
    that love doesn''t factor into it. he has told me that he doesn''t love me or
    even like me. he is emotionally and verbally abusive. i worry that ending the
    marriage will hurt the children, but i also worry that continuing this unloving
    relationship will hurt them even more. i don''t want them to grow up not knowing
    what a loving relationship between a husband and wife is like, or thinking that
    they can''t stand up for themselves or what they believe in. but i''m afraid that
    divorce would cause them even more damage. what''s your unbiased advice? -- betwixt

    my beautiful, intelligent 18-year-old daughter, "lara," has just completed her
    first year of college. she''s attending school out of state in the same city where
    her father, "grant" -- my ex -- is living. abby, grant left when lara was 5 months
    old. he left us for his sister, with whom he had been having an affair, because
    she told him she was pregnant with his child. the divorce was very hard on us,
    and my daughter has been in counseling for years -- including at the college.
    lara spends her holidays with her father, her aunt and their two children. she''s
    aware of the incestuous relationship and vents a lot of anger at me for the rough
    time we''ve had. in the past, lara''s therapists have told me she directs her
    anger at me because "she can''t get angry at the person she should really be angry
    at -- her father." my daughter refuses to tell her current therapist about the
    incestuous relationship because she''s afraid it will be reported to the authorities
    and the children will be taken away. the sister bought lara a car and a cell phone,
    and pays the phone bill, car insurance and some of lara''s other expenses. i suspect
    the thought of losing the car and cell phone have something to do with my daughter''s
    hesitation to level with her therapist. how can i get lara to stop abusing me
    because of her repressed anger at her father? -- loving mother in alabama'

    to mention that she should stay off our computer because it contains sensitive

    we tried to share a room, but i never got any sleep and was extremely crabby and

    the tv on; i must have complete silence and total darkness. i need nine hours
    of sleep to feel rested; he''s a night owl who gets by on four to five hours.
    i have tried sleep masks and ear plugs without success. we do share a bed when
    we travel, but when i have to get up for work in the morning, i''d better sleep

    about having left a message with us. people take their last pill in the morning,
    neglect to call the doctor''s office all day, then scream at us because their
    doctor has a "no refills after office hours" policy. then, there are the doctors

    their writing. tenants call their apartment after-hours emergency lines and call
    us names because insect infestations are not considered an emergency by their

    who call us stupid when we ask them to spell the unusual names their mothers made
    up for them at birth. thankfully, there are enough polite callers and wonderful

    i''m the father of a 13-year-old daughter, "shelby," who i''m unable to reach.
    when shelby was very young, i noticed that she would be very disrespectful to
    her mother at times. of course, i would explain that that kind of behavior was
    unacceptable, and generally it would stop. other times, it caused an argument
    between my wife, "fran," and me. fran felt it was just a stage and required no
    punishment, whereas i thought it did. now that shelby is older, her behavior has
    gotten much worse. she screams at fran all the time, calls her names, throws tantrums
    when she doesn''t get her way, does poorly in school -- the list goes on and on.
    what''s more, she''s now starting to raise her voice at me when she doesn''t get
    her way. when i try to explain to shelby that there are consequences for her actions
    -- such as grounding or taking away privileges -- she starts screaming and crying,
    which instantly draws the ire of her mother. fran is always making excuses for
    why shelby behaves the way that she does. basically, i cannot discipline my own

    suffer if the secret is revealed. (you advised her to do so.) unfortunately, that
    isn''t all she needs to be afraid of. i was molested by my father at age 7, and
    again by my brother at 14. unfortunately, revealing what happened put me in the
    position of being perceived as "the accuser," while these two family members are
    regarded as "innocents." i''m the one who is "forgotten" at family reunions. i
    am the one not invited for sunday dinners. why? the answer i was given by my own
    mother was: "he''s now so old and fragile, he doesn''t remember. his time on earth
    is limited, so why bring up horrible things that can only cloud what days he has
    left?" he wasn''t old and frail when he molested a 7-year-old. i didn''t bring
    out these allegations on my own. i was in therapy, and just coming to the realization
    that "something awful might have happened," when i got a phone call asking me
    straight out if i recalled any kind of abuse by my father. dad had admitted it
    while in psychiatric care before he was placed in a nursing home. my world crumbled
    in seconds. as for my brother, no one has heard from him in three years. i''m
    not sure he even knows that what he did to me is now out in the open. but i listen
    to my mother cry for a lost son and the grandchildren she will never see again.
    i also listen to other relatives -- who also know what happened -- comment that
    "maybe one day he''ll just show up," and "wouldn''t that be great?" please warn
    "lost teen" that while she may fear what happens to her molester, there''s always
    the flip side of that coin. the first thing counselors tell us is it wasn''t our
    fault. but sometimes our families treat us like it is. -- lost in the land of

    what advice have you when the situation is reversed? several times we have invited

    my wife and i are very worried about the safety of our two toddlers -- a 3-year-old
    boy and a 15-month-old girl. their twin 7-year-old cousins have no manners, discipline
    or consequences in their lives. they have recently begun seeing a psychiatrist
    because they have been found with knives, or making stabbing motions toward themselves
    screaming, "kill me now!" every member of the family agrees they are out of control,
    but nobody does anything to correct their behavior. when we told my mother-in-law
    we didn''t want our children around the twins without direct supervision, her
    response was she "couldn''t watch them every minute." we said fine, we would bring
    the kids over and one of us would directly supervise them. this led to an uncomfortable
    silence that lasted a few days, until today when my wife took the kids to her
    parents'' for a birthday party. the afternoon went by with the twins'' usual defiance,
    rudeness and belittling of any adult in sight. after she returned from my in-laws'',
    my wife proceeded to tell me their bay window had a hole in it because one of
    the twins had shot a loaded gun through it. i am stunned that while we have been

    should do about it because they didn''t want to hurt me. i didn''t read any further,
    and i haven''t mentioned to my wife that i saw it. i can understand what''s behind
    it -- i''m almost 40 and i''ve gained a lot of weight in recent years. i have
    never been a great husband, and my wife has made it clear she doesn''t feel the
    same way about me as she once did. the man who wrote to her is a really nice person,
    and i trust both of them enough that i doubt there is anything physical going
    on. they''re just trying to deal with their emotions. complicating things, my

    for both of us. i love my fiance, "gill," very much, but i have a gut feeling
    something is not right. since our engagement i am noticing things i either didn''t
    see or ignored before. some examples: gill recently moved back to his home state,
    so we talk on the phone every other day. when we talk, he has to make whatever
    we talk about sexual. not that i have anything against sex -- it just annoys me
    that gill can''t think beyond his zipper when i''m trying to talk about a movie
    i just saw. he also never really has discussed his family or his past. he has
    met the majority of my family, but i have yet to meet anyone from his. gill makes
    a point of saying, once we are married he firmly believes the man should be "the
    head of the household, the decision maker." i told him that i don''t believe in
    that "caveman, cavewoman" mentality and for him to get over himself. although
    he has never verbally or physically abused me, i''m getting strange vibes, and
    i''m ready to call off the engagement. am i being paranoid or a ... nervous bride-to-be?'

    i have always had my election ballots sent to my mother''s house. (she lives only
    three blocks away.) while i was out of town on a recent business trip, my mother
    requested an absentee ballot in my name and then voted for me without my knowledge.
    when she told me over the phone what she had done, i told her it was illegal.

    fifteen years ago i had a years-long affair with a woman 23 years my junior. "alex"
    was 17 when we first had sex. i never led her on. i told her on many occasions
    that i would not leave my wife and family for another woman -- even her. i told
    her i''d meet her secretly for as long as she wanted, but i would commit to nothing
    more. alex accepted this state of affairs for several years, and we had what i
    considered to be the perfect affair. i loved the passionate, uninhibited sex.
    because i could offer no more than the status quo, i wasn''t surprised when one
    night, after a particularly exhausting love-making session, alex announced she
    was ending our affair and moving to los angeles to be closer to friends. i begged
    her to reconsider, promised to spend more time with her, and insisted that i loved
    her. she went anyway. we had no contact other than christmas and birthday cards.
    my kids are now grown and gone. on a recent business trip to la, i decided to
    give alex a call for old times'' sake. she was delighted to hear from me and invited
    me over for a drink. it was just like old times. i wasn''t there five minutes
    when she literally tore my clothes off. so what''s my problem? alex just told
    me she might move back here and take up where we left off. abby, an affair like
    ours was fine 15 years ago, but i''m no longer comfortable sneaking around. my
    wife and i have been married 30 years and i don''t want to hurt her or give her
    up. i''m afraid if alex moves back, we''ll get caught. i still love her, and i
    certainly enjoy making love to her -- but how do i tell her that it''s fine for
    us to sleep together in la where she lives, but not here in my hometown? -- in

    forty-five years ago, my sister adopted a lovely 3-week-old baby girl, "rita."
    the adoption went smoothly and all is well. rita now has a daughter of her own

    gold cross that had been placed around her neck by her birth mother. my sister
    didn''t know what to do with it, so she gave it to me and asked me to take it
    to a church and leave it in a pew. my conscience wouldn''t let me carry out her
    instructions, and i still have the cross. what do you suggest i do with it? should
    i do as my sister asked? should i give the cross anonymously to rita? or should

    your advice was sensitive, but a better answer might be to simply respond by giving
    the number of children to whom she gave birth. the questioner may simply be attempting
    to make polite conversation or trying to find common ground with an opening gambit.
    if the mother chooses to talk about it, she should say, "susie is in baltimore,
    jack is in college and bob recently died in a car accident. so ... where do you
    work?" this is brief and honest. the sensitive questioner would respond, "i''m
    sorry for your loss. i''m an engineer at abc company." incidentally, two questions
    i have learned never to ask are, "is this your father, mother, niece or daughter?"
    the much-older husband and the much-younger wife tend to be offended by it. also,
    never ask, "when is your baby due?" or "are you expecting?" unless the baby is
    emerging at that exact moment. -- jan in valdosta, ga.'

    i''m a single woman in my 20s who works hard and has friends i like and respect.
    one of them, however, "ava," is making it hard for me to be around her. ava is
    38, never married, has had only one boyfriend in her life, and is very lonely.
    as a single person, i understand how that can feel. it has become a daily ritual
    for her to come over to my desk for one of the following three reasons: (1) to
    talk about her loneliness and having nothing in her life to look forward to; (2)
    to borrow change because she has no money for doughnuts, a soda, etc; (3) to rub
    my back so i''ll feel obligated to rub her shoulders that day. (i don''t ask for
    the back rub, but i did once -- two years ago -- and now she thinks we have an
    unspoken agreement.) when i offer advice on overcoming her loneliness, ava ignores
    it. the money issue is also upsetting because she earns more than i do and is
    in terrible debt. i tell ava repeatedly she needs counseling for her money problems
    and loneliness, but she refuses because she "doesn''t need to see anyone." also,
    the back-rubbing has gotten old. i''m not her personal masseuse. how can i refuse
    without sending her into a deeper depression? i''m becoming mentally exhausted.
    she''s a bottomless pit. i don''t have any more answers; i''ve given all the answers

    my husband, "gene," and i met a week before my 13th birthday. gene had always
    been a poor student and preferred a job making money to learning. (he never learned

    into our own home in 1999. we both wanted children, and our daughter was born
    in 2001. our relationship was great -- until we had someone else to care for.
    because gene was brought up old-fashioned, he decided i was to stay at home and
    care for the house and kids while he worked and provided for us. things got physical
    not long after our daughter arrived. we''d argue and i''d try to leave, only to
    result in my being choked. or he''d throw me against a wall to prevent me from
    calling 911. one time, he broke my nose. he was never violent toward the children
    -- i had a son in 2004 -- only toward me because of them. he said i never did
    things right or i took up for them. i left for good six weeks ago. i have left
    many times before, but went back because of dependency. this time i have a lot

    last april, my nephew, "frank," a first lieutenant in the army, was on the third
    day of a road trip from fort campbell, ky., to seattle to deliver his pickup truck
    to his parents'' home for storage during his second tour of duty in iraq. he was
    on i-80 near cheyenne, wyo., in a snowstorm when his truck skidded on an icy patch,
    collided with a big rig, rolled over multiple times and landed off the roadway
    in the snow. frank had multiple deep lacerations to his head, legs and feet, crushed
    bones in one foot and back, and neck injuries. several passers-by stopped to help.
    one was a nurse who held his neck straight until the paramedics arrived, and a
    trucker couple who called frank''s parents. however, while these good samaritans
    were helping him, another group was going through frank''s things and stealing
    whatever they wanted. these scavengers took his cell phone, digital camera, army
    helmet, wallet with military id, the truck radio -- even his keys. the tow truck
    driver finally shooed them away. i have never considered myself naive. i have
    lived on i-80 for 20 years and never heard of this happening. abby, those people
    actually stole the military id off a bleeding soldier. is this as shocking to

    dar abby: something happened on a flight to the southwest part of the united states
    recently, and i''m still seething about it. the flight attendant was taking drink
    orders. when she took the orders for my nieces, she instructed them to say "please"
    when giving their order. my sister and i looked at each other in stunned silence.
    there were other children seated around us, and we listened to see if she would
    ask them to also say please. they didn''t, nor did she ask them to. please note
    that my sister and i are african-american. my nieces are of mixed-race parentage;
    the children sitting around us were caucasian. when the drink orders arrived and
    were being distributed, the flight attendant told my nieces to say "thank you."
    abby, my nieces are very polite girls. they were always taught to say please and
    thank you. having someone demand that they say it before they had an opportunity
    to do so on their own was humiliating not only to them but also to my sister and
    me. what should we have done? should we have taken the attendant aside and asked
    for an apology, ignored it, or spoken to the airline about it? the whole incident
    has left a bad taste in our mouths. -- embarrassed in elgin, ill.'

    my cousin, "carol," lives with my grandma "lil." carol is 30 and unemployed. she''s
    a sponge who has lived with all of the members of our family in the area -- even
    me when i was 20 and had my own apartment. grandma lil has noticed that periodically
    some of her pain medication has been missing. an expensive watch also went missing.
    when my grandmother asked carol if she had seen it, the watch mysteriously reappeared
    in her jewelry box. last week, grandma lil was too sick to attend church and asked
    carol to please pick up some medicine for her. carol replied, "not today," and
    walked out the door. after several other arguments, grandma lil suggested that
    carol start looking for somewhere else to live. carol said, "what do you care?
    you have enough money to pay for two people." i''m so angry i can''t see straight.
    carol needs to be removed from the house, but i''m not sure how to do it. we don''t

    we have a neighbor, an unmarried man in his late 50s, who has always made me a
    bit uncomfortable. he doesn''t work and is always home. we have a 13-year-old
    daughter, "kimberly," who occasionally stays alone for several hours at a time
    while i run errands. i have always told kimberly that if she''s by herself, she
    should not open the door to anyone outside of immediate family. in addition, after
    seeing an episode of "oprah," i instructed her that if she did mess up and open
    the door for some reason, she should slam it shut if she saw it was a man alone.
    she didn''t have to be polite. well, our neighbor came over recently in a rage,
    complaining that our dog had gotten loose. we apologized profusely and told him
    we''d remedy the situation. we didn''t want him to be unhappy with us. however,
    he just got angrier and angrier. he stopped talking about the dog and began ranting
    about kimberly, saying she didn''t know how to act and had slammed the door in
    his face last year. i explained that she was only 12 at the time and may have
    been frightened, but he continued to rant. (the dog was forgotten.) was i wrong
    to tell kimberly she didn''t need to be polite to our older male neighbor standing
    alone at our door? am i just raising a rude child? was it normal for him to come
    over a year later and yell at us about our daughter to the point of threatening
    to hit my husband? experts tell kids to "get away," "don''t go near the car,"
    "don''t help the adult neighbor find his puppy," etc. but what do you do when

    as a dog trainer and former veterinary assistant, my first question to "saturated"
    would have been, is liebchen neutered? if not, it would explain a lot. while male

    for them to do so when they''re intact. although "saturated" and her mother-in-law

    have lived with my dad ever since. this year, mom began to press for a ticket
    to my graduation. i don''t want her there. she won''t admit to having a problem,
    despite the fact she has been in rehab 10 times. i can''t remember a time prior
    to her extended hospital stays and visits by home nurses. before i have any event,
    she becomes manipulative and checks herself into the hospital. this hasn''t happened
    just once or twice. i''m talking about every event since i was in fourth grade
    -- including my birthday, my older brother''s graduation, everything. last year,
    she forgot my birthday. i didn''t even get a phone call. i don''t think she has
    earned a ticket for graduation. many people in my life have been there for me

    my girlfriend of several years, "tami," became my fiancee last fall. we plan to
    be married this summer. i am white; tami is black. for the majority of our relatives,
    this is not a problem. a few close relatives, however, have made their disapproval
    of interracial marriage quite clear. i chalk it up to their generation and the
    world they grew up in. the civil rights movement never happened for them. tami
    and i have decided not to invite those who disapprove. i don''t even want them
    to have the option. sourpusses do not make good wedding guests, so why waste the
    invitation? with help from tami''s father, we''re paying for the wedding, and
    we are in agreement. my mother, however, is worried about insulting people. i
    think it would be a good lesson for them to experience that there are consequences
    for racist attitudes. i told mom i''d run this one by you. your thoughts, please?

    i am very confused right now. when i was 15, i was raped and became pregnant.
    my father made me give the baby away. ever since, i have always wanted to know
    how she was doing and where she was. (i am now 21.) recently, my grandmother told
    me that my daughter is fine and that she lives close by. i was never told because
    they were afraid i''d want her back and it wasn''t possible. abby, i am very upset
    that they have never told me where my child was or that the couple who adopted
    her didn''t mind me coming to visit or spend time with her. i told my boyfriend
    what happened. he accepts that i have a daughter. do you think i have a right
    to be angry because my family didn''t disclose my child''s whereabouts because

    i am a female experiencing what one might call "ugly duckling syndrome." i was
    an awkward child and adolescent, and was teased and rejected by my peers -- especially
    boys. as i reached adulthood, i "blossomed" into a good-looking young woman --
    not exactly a swan, but definitely easier on the eyes than i was. i get a lot
    of attention from guys now, but no matter how many people tell me i''m beautiful,
    i still don''t believe it. inside, i''m still the same plain, unattractive girl
    i used to be. when people stare at me in public, the first thing i think is they''re
    thinking how ugly i am. abby, my negative attitude is pushing people away. people
    don''t really like being around me once they get to know me. (an acquaintance
    actually said to me, "you''re one of the prettiest girls i know, but your attitude
    is ugly.") what can i do to enhance my confidence without becoming conceited?

    my husband, "don," and i have been married for five years. we have two beautiful
    children, and don is a terrific father. for the most part, we have a good life
    together and get along well. the problem is his sister, "marsha." marsha has major
    boundary issues, and she tries to undermine my role as both mother and wife. their
    mother died young, and marsha took on the role of mother. she still hasn''t let
    go. when don and i first began dating, marsha said some extremely nasty things
    in an effort to break us up. for example, she said i wasn''t his type (right!),
    that he had been promiscuous in his past (not true), and that i would never know
    don as well as she knows him. (she still says it on a regular basis.) when don
    and i have the rare quarrel, he goes running off to marsha for advice. he also
    spends time with her on his days off, and they discuss very personal issues in
    our marriage. marsha uses this personal information as fodder for gossip and pretends
    to be our "counselor." because don knows it upsets me, he now lies about visiting
    her or her coming over. i am on the brink of telling him i don''t want to see
    his sister anymore. other than our issues with her, our life is wonderful. any

    i have an ethics question for you. the other night, my husband and i went to a

    ticket stubs, we realized we''d been charged the senior rate rather than the one
    for adult admission. i''m only 51, but i started turning gray in college and don''t
    color my hair. my husband is a couple of years younger (i call him my "boy toy"),
    but i''m sure we looked "old" to the pink-cheeked high school student selling
    the tickets. this has happened to me on a couple of other occasions, and i have
    said nothing. on the one hand, i feel like we are receiving a benefit under false
    pretenses. on the other hand, i still recall being 11 and tall for my age, and
    being required to buy adult tickets from people who didn''t believe i wasn''t
    12. i would never claim to be a senior to get a discount, because i''m not --

    i have a married niece with a 4-month-old baby girl whom i love dearly. they have
    a medium-sized dog that they rescued from a shelter, and the dog is prone to attacking
    other dogs. for a time they considered returning the dog to the shelter, but now
    they have it trained quite well. it responds to voice commands, but is still aggressive,
    primarily to other dogs. on at least one occasion my niece and her husband have
    paid vet bills for dogs that have been injured. this dog stays in the house with
    them and the baby, and my fear is that as the baby gets a little older, this dog
    may attack her. i''m an emergency room nurse. i have seen the results of dog attacks
    on small children. most of them were house pets with no history of aggressiveness.
    it seems the sounds a small child makes, combined with their normal, uncoordinated
    movement and grabbing, can mimic prey-like activity. the dogs, responding like
    the animals they are, attack. in one instance, the injured toddler died. i have
    cautioned my niece and her husband not to let the dog lick (they say "kiss") the
    baby or let her play near the dog unsupervised, which they don''t always do. even
    on a leash, i have seen this dog lunge at another dog without warning. i fear

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    after six years of marriage and a beautiful daughter, my wife, "chanelle," demanded
    a separation. she said she needed time to "find herself." she forgot to mention
    that she was having an affair with a subordinate at work, "earl." eventually,
    earl''s wife and i found out. chanelle lost her job, her boyfriend and her self-respect.
    suddenly she wanted me back. i wasn''t sure i could live with a woman who had
    lied and cheated on me. after a year later, chanelle became pregnant with our
    son, who is due in a few months. i''m positive the baby is mine, so we decided
    for the children''s sake to reconcile. i still can''t forgive chanelle for the
    affair. she used a string of lies to cover her activities, so i''m having severe
    trust issues. i was faithful throughout our marriage. while we were separated,
    i frequently lent her money and ran errands for her. at the time, she told me
    she hadn''t been in love with me since the birth of our daughter. now i feel used.
    during our separation, i made sure our daughter called chanelle''s parents every
    night. we spent holidays with them while chanelle worked. instead of thanking
    me for it, they insist that i drove their daughter into the arms of another man.
    to make things worse, my parents refuse to accept chanelle back into the family.
    in all fairness, chanelle was the last person you''d think would have an affair.
    she was family-oriented and had conservative values. earl was the last person
    you''d imagine she''d choose. he''s a chain-smoking, married redneck with a history
    of infidelity. both sets of in-laws are trying to sabotage the marriage, my feelings
    for my wife have changed, and i now realize i never really knew chanelle at all.
    can this marriage be saved? -- shaken, not stirred in west virginia'

    in the eye and says i''m the one he has searched for and needed his entire life.
    i am 30 and have never been married. i can hardly wait to have children with clayton
    so we can raise them together. he''s excited, too, which surprises me because
    he''s in his mid-40s and has two teenagers. he''s very active in their lives.
    (he and his wife parted amicably.) i sometimes sense odd vibes from his co-workers

    is it absolutely necessary for a married person to wear a wedding ring? i am an
    independent woman with my own career in a technical and demanding field. i will
    never be a "traditional" wife. in fact, i resent the stereotyped gender roles
    that traditional marriage represents. furthermore, i detest wearing rings in general.
    i find them uncomfortable and itchy. i have brushed up against engagement before
    and have not been able to think of a solution. i value the idea of marriage as
    a partnership that should be honored. it''s just that the traditional assumptions
    of others make my skin crawl, and so do rings in general. there must be other
    women -- or men -- out there with this problem. what would you suggest? -- free

    what is proper etiquette when someone has been staring at you in a restaurant
    or at an event? it makes me uncomfortable when i''m in a situation -- like a social
    or networking event -- where i can''t leave. usually, when i''m alone or with
    another person, i''ll just move away. but there have been times when i find myself
    trapped. should i ask the person staring at me, "how can i help you?" i can ignore

    i am a 46-year-old man who has been married for 29 years. i was a father at 18,

    kids. our children are grown now, and i am still with her. frankly, what we have
    is more like a chore than a marriage. i won''t even go into what i think about
    her family. i wish i could change and try to love her, but it has reached the
    point where i make excuses not to have sex. even when barbara calls me "honey,"
    it turns my stomach. my wife is a good person, and i wish i had it in me to say
    i love her, but it''s just not there. i am repelled emotionally and physically.
    i am confused and don''t want to hurt barbara, but i can''t say the words or go
    through the motions. i''d like us to be friends, and i''ll live with her as long

    i have lived with my boyfriend for five years. "brian" is a good man and a decent
    boyfriend. i get along well with his family and particularly his mom. brian is
    sweet, sensitive and, for the most part, very laid-back. my problem is brian''s
    temper. although he has never physically abused me, when he gets angry, he completely
    loses control. he breaks things like phones, radios, doors and anything else around
    him. it is terrifying to watch. during those times, saying anything to him only
    makes it worse. once i tried going out when it happened, and he broke the phone.

    i have been divorced for 10 years. i raised my three children alone while working
    a 40-hour week. it hasn''t been easy. now that my youngest is 15 and the older
    two are out on their own, i decided to go out with "harold," a gentleman i have
    known for five years. he would come every day to visit me and chat with me at
    work, so i finally accepted one of his invitations to go out for coffee. our relationship
    proceeded from there. harold accepted me, the kids, my relatives and friends.
    we get along beautifully. we never disagree or argue. it''s like i have been swept
    off my feet by prince charming. i have never been so happy. we do things as a
    family and are always together -– except every night he goes home at 11 p.m. to
    his house, which is one hour from mine. so what''s the problem? harold never mentioned
    that he has been married for 27 years and has a large family with many grandchildren.
    i got a phone call from a lady named "ellen" who told me that harold is her husband.
    she said she loves him, and begged me to end the relationship and tell him to
    go home to his family. when harold showed up for supper last night i told him
    about the phone call. he didn''t deny any of it. he asked me if he had said he
    was married, would i have had coffee with him? would he be in my life now? he
    says their marriage has been over since 2000, but because they are wealthy, a
    divorce would be very expensive, so it''s better they live together and go their
    separate ways. he swears that he loves only me and my family, and he wants our
    relationship to continue! abby, i''m 45 years old and scared. i can''t believe
    this has happened to me. i''m sick, brokenhearted and confused. please tell me

    my husband and i recently lost our 24-year-old son in an automobile accident.
    while the emotional pain is tremendous, we''re now beginning to venture out into
    social gatherings. inevitably the question comes up, "how many children do you
    have?" how should we answer that question? it feels wrong to acknowledge only
    our two remaining children, but saying, "we had three, but recently lost one"
    sounds like we have a cat that can''t find its way home. also, it steers the conversation
    in one of two paths -- a detailed conversation about his death, or one that ends
    awkwardly. should we just say we have one son living "here" and a daughter living
    "there," and assume the person will eventually learn that we had another child?
    this may seem like a silly question, but it makes us not want to venture out much.

    i have recently turned 14. when i was 7, i was sexually abused by a close female
    relative. the abuse wasn''t as severe as in most cases of molestation, but i know
    what happened to me was wrong. i forgive this relative and do not bear the emotional
    scars that most victims do. i''m wondering whether i should ever tell my family
    about what happened to me. if i do, i am afraid they will hate this relative for

    up to me to decide whether or not to tell my parents. what do you think i should

    would you please help us to inform the many elderly widows and widowers of retired

    my second husband, "les," and i married seven years ago. we each owned our own

    it was les'' house, i never discussed it. les and i recently sold our houses and

    however, my mother-in-law will come only if it takes no more than 15 minutes to

    this, i no longer feel my children should have to visit his parents on holidays
    if they don''t want to. i find this situation even more upsetting because i have
    explained to my in-laws that my children''s father does not visit them, nor do

    many mornings, in your column, and other advice columns, i see problems about
    weddings. the letters all voice similar complaints: reality is interfering with
    someone''s dream wedding. one letter you printed came from a young woman who was
    upset that she wasn''t getting the kind of wedding she wanted because her mother
    and mother-in-law were paying for it. your advice to pay for what she wanted herself
    was valid -- but she might also keep the following in mind. as a mother of two
    daughters, i, too, was obsessed about hosting the "perfect wedding." then a dear
    friend and neighbor, the rabbi who was to officiate at my daughter''s weddings,
    commented: "the wedding lasts at most two hours; it''s the marriage that counts."
    that bit of wisdom helped me relax. my daughters'' marriages have lasted 27 and
    30 years, respectively. although the celebrations were lovely, i''m sure neither
    one was "perfect." but who cares? no one! how right he was. -- sue r. in cincinnati'

    my problem may seem small compared to many of the letters in your column, but
    i don''t know what to do. my problem concerns dentists'' offices. when i was young,
    dentists had private treatment rooms for patients. now i cannot find a dentist
    who doesn''t subscribe to the "open floor plan." all examinations, treatments
    and cleanings take place in plain view of whoever passes by. i am a very private
    person, and in addition, i have some teeth that are like the stars. (they come
    out at night.) i like to maintain the fantasy that my family, friends and neighbors
    do not know my secret. however, the illusion is difficult to maintain when i sit
    in plain view with my mouth open, while the "pearly whites" that once appeared
    to be mine rest on a pedestal, and my next-door neighbor strolls over to say hello.
    the old saying, "it''s a small world," never rings so true as when i''m in the
    dentist''s chair. i shudder to think that my gynecologist could follow in my dentist''s
    footsteps. the dentist knows how i feel, but he has no private rooms in his office.
    i could look for another dentist who offers more privacy, but i have been with
    "dr. bill" for 20 years, and i really like him. any suggestions, abby? -- overexposed

    my husband and i are well-educated professionals. this is the second marriage
    for both of us. we love each other and feel blessed to have found each other.
    our sex life was wonderful for the first two years of our marriage. but we''ve
    been married for four years now, and for the last two i have had to beg him for
    affection. i''m lucky if it happens every other month now, and when it does it''s
    like he''s thinking, "ok, let''s get this chore over with," and he merely accommodates
    me. i have told him how ugly, unloved and insecure this makes me feel, but nothing
    changes. i always thought it was a sin to cheat on your spouse, but, abby, i''m

    five years ago, while i was in high school, i broke up with my boyfriend. i was
    very immature then and didn''t appreciate what i had. he and i remained friendly
    after the breakup, and he married someone else. the marriage was a disaster from
    the beginning, and some mutual friends have told me that he confided that he wished
    he had married me. he and his wife divorced about a year ago. not long after that,
    he started dropping by the store where i work to make small talk. abby, i really
    miss him. i think about him all the time. he was the nicest guy i have ever dated.
    i''d like to start seeing him again, but i don''t know how to get the ball rolling.
    i don''t think he''s dating anyone, and i''m not even sure he would want to date
    me. i''m afraid if i make the first move he will laugh at me. what should i do?

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i met an attractive woman at a consumer products show. she works for a company
    that supplies items to the store where i work. she wasn''t wearing a ring, and
    she seemed interested in me, so i decided to ask her to lunch. i had always heard
    that women welcome flowers, and prefer them to direct invitations because it allows
    them to reply with a warm thank-you or refuse without putting anyone on the spot.
    so i ordered a mixed bouquet with a card that carried a friendly -- not romantic
    -- message. she never acknowledged it, but i received a brief fax from her boss
    saying that i was off-base and the flowers were inappropriate. he signed off with
    a directive that i make no further contact. abby, i was mortified! was it necessary
    to embarrass me with a fax that everyone in the store could have read? i don''t
    know if he took it upon himself to do this, or she asked him to do it for her.
    i''m not even sure whether she received the flowers or if he intercepted them.
    all that fax did was ensure an awkward situation the next time she and i cross
    paths at a show or during business transactions. how should i handle our next
    meeting? should i pretend it never happened? should i cross them off our supplier
    list to avoid further contact? should i let her know so that i can possibly get
    another shot at it, or did i blow it so terribly wrong? i''m a caring, sensitive
    person and don''t understand why this innocent gesture generated such a reply.

    i am in a relationship with a guy who does not like to kiss. we act like an old
    married couple. he''s not affectionate or romantic in any way at all. he''ll hold
    my hand in public, but that''s it. i''m wondering if it''s because of depression.
    he loves to work, but i think it''s to cover his depression. he tells me every
    day that he loves me, and we never fight. we actually get along very well. are
    some men just not affectionate? i would like to be, but i know he''s not that
    type. my parents are not affectionate people, and they have been together for
    38 years. my boyfriend has told me that he knows there is something wrong with
    him and that he needs counseling about his behavior. we have a lot in common and
    see each other every day, so we are definitely serious. we laugh and click in
    ways other than being romantic and passionate. is there any hope? -- starved for

    my husband, a middle-aged minister, can rarely perform in the bedroom without
    wearing women''s lingerie. i have put up with it because he seems to need it.
    lately he has begun wearing a bra around the house every day. he tries to hide
    it by wearing a heavy shirt or coat, but i can feel it when i hug him before leaving
    for work. i suspect he''s even worn it to church. what would the parishioners
    think if they knew their preacher was delivering his sermon while wearing a bra?
    it''s starting to affect our marriage. he rarely speaks to me lately, and when
    he does, it''s usually in monosyllables. i know he''s not gay. until now, our
    marriage has been a happy one. i know many men have this problem. maybe it shouldn''t
    bother me so much, but it does. i don''t know who to talk to. everybody else takes
    their problems to their minister, but my husband is one. if i go to his superiors,
    i''m afraid i''ll get him into trouble, which i don''t want to do. why do men
    wear women''s clothes? is it wrong? i appreciate any insight you can give me.

    i love the occasional "how we met" stories in your column, and would like to share
    mine. "blake" lived in the apartment below me during college. his roommates and
    mine would often get together casually. one night, after work, blake announced
    that he had to pick up his sister from the airport. "would anyone like to ride
    along and keep me awake?" he asked. i had nothing better to do, so i volunteered.
    during the drive, blake pulled out a two-carat diamond ring and said, "i know
    i don''t know you very well, but ..." he was grinning from ear to ear, and i was
    hugging the door handle wondering, "is this guy for real?" when he saw my reaction,
    he started laughing and apologized. the ring belonged to his sister. she was returning
    from her honeymoon and had asked him to keep it so it wouldn''t be lost. i''m
    quick-witted, so i got back at him when we reached the airport. i went first through
    the security checkpoint. (those were the days when you could wait at the gate
    for your passenger to get off the plane.) when blake passed through the metal
    detector, of course it "beeped" and he had to empty his pockets. as soon as he
    put the ring box on the tray, i started jumping up and down, saying loudly, "oh,
    honey. yes! yes!" then i threw my arms around his neck and gave him a huge hug.
    people around us began clapping and blake was so embarrassed! twenty minutes later
    people were still pointing and whispering about the guy who had just proposed.
    from that night on, we knew we''d end up together. we''re two practical jokers
    who still make each other laugh after 12 years and four children. -- kate in idaho

    want to come home, put my feet up, and read a book in peace and quiet, or better

    every holiday or special occasion that''s celebrated in our home involves a certain

    their ages range from 38 to 40. when these supposed grown-ups come to visit, open
    gifts, etc., they wind up wrestling in our living room. the base of one of my
    lamps has been chipped, and once, my granddaughter (then 10) was pushed into a

    to stop or to go downstairs, and this year i asked them to take it outside. they''ll
    quit for a while, but act like i''m ruining their fun by telling them to stop.
    my husband refuses to say anything to them about it. he says it''s a small price
    to pay because they are otherwise helpful, considerate and caring individuals,
    which is true. i should add that alcohol is involved, but to remove it is not
    an option. it would create huge problems between my husband and me if i suggested

    i invite my best friend, "lara," out for lunch about twice a month, so we can

    of fun stuff. paying for nicky drains my budget pretty quickly. he invariably

    my 25-year-old son, "mitch," and his live-in girlfriend, "mimi," just became engaged,
    and i''m really worried. they met in college, where mimi admits she went to "get
    her mrs." when mitch took a job in another state and started working on his graduate
    degree, mimi tagged along. at first she had her own apartment. but since she "couldn''t
    afford" a car, mitch drove her to and from work every day. then she got a job
    where he worked, and they began having lunch together every day to the exclusion
    of co-workers. two years later, mimi still has no car of her own in a state where
    cars are a necessity. in addition, she''s "just so tired" after her "long" 7 1/2-hour
    day that she "just can''t manage to cook," so they either go out or mitch does
    the cooking, too. abby, my son is lean, outgoing, into sports and martial arts.
    mimi is obese and lethargic. she constantly complains about her aches and pains
    and other people. she has no hobbies and spends every night watching television.
    i''m afraid this is somehow my fault. mitch''s mother was "high maintenance."
    i modeled caretaking for him in his early years when she and i were married --
    we have been divorced for more than 10 years -- but never to this extent. now
    mimi has announced she needs surgery and pain-killers because she''s got a bad
    back, and "exercise doesn''t work." (how could it? she''d have to actually move!)
    i''m desperate to have a father-son talk about the path mitch seems to be heading
    down, but i also know i risk alienating him, maybe permanently. should i keep
    my mouth shut, or what? -- panicked pop in pawtucket'

    my son is 15 -- nearly 16. he has become a wonderful young man, a delight to be
    around -- but then again, i probably am biased. when we''re home and watching
    tv in the evening, my son often enjoys cuddling up next to me. he''ll put his
    head on my shoulder and wants my arm around his shoulders. i, too, enjoy this
    very much, and when he says, "oh, mommy, i love you so much," as he often does,
    my heart melts. i should mention that he is still shorter than me, though barely.
    he is not the typical 15-year-old who towers over his mother. let me clarify a
    couple of things. one, he is my only child. two, there is nothing torrid going
    on, no inappropriate touching by him or by me, and three, he doesn''t do it when
    his friends are over -- although he''s not afraid to hug and kiss me goodbye in
    front of them. also, he loves his father very much, will hug and kiss him occasionally,
    and still enjoys sitting between us on the sofa, however difficult that may be
    on our two-person loveseat. until recently, i thought our closeness would help
    him develop into a warm, loving man; but now, i''m wondering if this is healthy
    for him to be doing and for me to allow. it seems like a completely natural thing
    to do in a loving family, but lately i''ve been wondering how this might affect
    his future relationships with women. i would hate to see him develop into a needy,

    i am a happily married man, raising two daughters, ages 12 and 15. a friend i
    have known for 20 years, "kevin," has become a little too friendly toward our
    15-year-old, "amanda." he has been giving amanda money for doing nothing. the
    first time, he gave her $300 and told her not to tell her mother or me. of course,
    our daughter told us anyway. when we confronted kevin, he said he felt sorry for
    amanda and she was supposed to baby-sit to pay back the loan, so we allowed her
    to keep the money to buy clothes with. a few weeks after that, kevin gave amanda
    $200 for letting him cut her long blond hair so he could sell it on the internet.
    needless to say, her mother and i were very upset. but instead of confronting
    him again, we just gave kevin the cold shoulder, hoping he''d get the message
    and go away. about a month later, he snuck into our home while my wife and i were
    out and installed a satellite box in amanda''s room. when we discovered the box,
    we asked amanda where it came from, and she said kevin. i looked at the programming
    on the box. it had been rigged with free pay and pornography channels. we were
    very upset. we removed the box, gave it back to our ex-friend and ordered him
    never to come around our kids again. do you think we did enough? we don''t want
    to overreact. -- unsure in washington'

    my mother died last year. my 93-year-old father now lives with my sister "lila"
    in her apartment back east. i have four brothers and another sister who reside
    in the same state. i live in arizona. although i''d love for dad to live here
    with me, he doesn''t want to put such a great distance between himself and the
    rest of the family. dad gets $3,000 a month from social security. since lila doesn''t
    work, she decided that she should be the one to take care of our father. all of
    us agreed that she should take dad''s social security check and use it for his
    care. dad also has about $400,000 put away that is to be split among his children
    when he passes away. recently, lila took $21,000 of our father''s money, claiming
    it was a "gift" so she can purchase a co-op. (dad would buy it; her name would
    be on the deed.) someone, i''m not sure who, called dad''s lawyer and reported
    the withdrawal. the lawyer met with lila and my brother "hersch," who has our
    father''s power of attorney. the lawyer told lila she can either pay back the
    $21,000 or it''ll be deducted from her inheritance. the lawyer then put dad''s
    money into a trust fund so it cannot be touched. now that she can''t have the
    money as a gift, lila is very angry and refuses to let anyone speak to daddy on
    the phone. we are pretty certain that lila never informed our father about the
    withdrawal -- she was trying to steal it. i think she is afraid we might say something
    about what happened. besides retaliating against us, it is also punishing dad.
    because i live across the country, the phone is my only means of communication
    with him. i''m at my wit''s end. lila has never gotten along with us siblings,
    and it has always been like pulling teeth to get her to let me speak to my father.
    now she''s severing the lines completely. is there anything i can do? -- help!

    imagine if, by applying what we already know, we could save the majority of lives
    that are lost to the third-leading cause of cancer in men and women. that''s no
    pie-in-the-sky dream. i''m talking about colon cancer. regular testing can help
    prevent this disease or detect it at its earliest, most treatable stage. this
    year, colon cancer will claim the lives of more than 56,000 americans. that''s
    more than 150 deaths a day, many of them preventable. the tests allow doctors
    to remove polyps before they can become cancerous, and prevent colon cancer from
    happening. these same tests can also detect early signs of the disease as effectively
    as mammography detects breast cancer. so why aren''t americans over the age of
    50 getting tested? many people simply do not realize they''re at risk beginning
    at age 50. some people think they don''t need to be tested because they have no
    family history of the disease or symptoms. the truth is, symptoms often don''t
    appear until colon cancer has progressed, and no matter what a person''s family
    history or how someone feels, if you''re 50 or older you''re at risk for colon
    cancer. there is also the perception that the test will be embarrassing or painful.
    while some of the tests may be uncomfortable, colon cancer is far worse. bottom
    line: if you''re 50 or older, now is the time to get tested for colon cancer.
    people with a family history of the disease or other risk factors should discuss
    with their doctors getting tested even earlier. abby, march marks the sixth annual
    national colorectal cancer awareness month. it''s a perfect time to start raising
    this important subject and making sure that americans get the test that could
    save their lives. do it now. don''t put it off. it''s one of the few cancer tests
    that can actually prevent the disease. -- stephen f. sener, m.d., president, american

    i need advice with a problem i have regarding our basset hound, "sherlock." i
    bought sherlock for my husband, "ken," a year and a half ago. ken loves the dog,
    and so does my 18-year-old daughter, "gretta," who lives with us. when i bought
    sherlock, the understanding was that he would be cared for by my husband and daughter.
    this is not what happened. i do 90 percent of the feeding, cleaning up after him,
    taking him to the groomer, the veterinarian, etc. we also have a cocker spaniel,
    "lulu," we have had since our gretta was 3. lulu has also been my responsibility
    for the most part. ken and gretta play with the dogs, and i "get" to do almost
    everything else. abby, i am not a dog lover; i am a dog "liker." i feel used and
    resentful. i want to give ken an ultimatum: care for sherlock or find another
    home for him. am i being unreasonable? i feel guilty thinking about doing this,
    because sherlock was a christmas gift to my husband, but i just don''t want to
    continue this way. ken works full time, as do i, but he commutes two hours each
    day. asking him and gretta to share in the care of the dogs has done no good.

    i am 38 and have never married. when i was in my 20s (and in much better shape)
    i was looking to settle down and -- hopefully -- marry someone. the women at the
    time ignored me. i was flat out told things like, "you''re nice, but boring."
    and, "i''ll never date a poor guy again." i have often felt, and still do, that
    women look for the "bad boy" or the guy with deep pockets. however, it seems that
    now they''re past their prime and have the two kids the bad boy left them with,
    i am now good enough -- even though i haven''t changed. i have had more female
    "encounters" in my 30s than i ever did in my 20s. how do you determine the legitimate
    ones from the ones who just want you to help raise their kids? if i wasn''t good
    enough for them then, why should they be good enough for me now? -- not the consolation

    i work in a hotel where many people pass through our lobby each day. we have great
    guests, but we also get our share of strange or questionable people, too. it''s
    not uncommon for police to send us information or inquire about criminals of various
    sorts who stop over at hotels. and, for the record, it doesn''t matter how posh
    the hotel is, either. my letter concerns parents who allow very young children
    to come to the front desk alone, or to hang out in the lobby. i have seen scantily
    clad young teens in swimsuits walk by. these girls have no clue that they''re
    being ogled by 40-plus businessmen in suits who make off-color comments about
    their bodies. it''s also not unusual to see 4- and 5-year-olds get on and off
    the elevators alone because their parents don''t feel like coming to the desk
    to pick up items. why, then, do we wonder how our kids are snatched up so easily
    by predators? hotel staff are here to serve and be helpful, but we cannot serve
    as baby sitters. we are often multitasking, so no one should assume we have an
    eye on your child. how are we to know whether the 50-year-old man pulling your
    12-year-old daughter aside and whispering something in her ear is her dad -- or
    a pervert? when children go missing, we staff members get screamed at by parents
    insisting that we should have seen something suspicious about the person the child
    was last seen with. well, here''s the simple answer: we''re employed to conduct
    hotel business, not monitor children. when the telephone rings, we must answer
    and take a reservation. our attention cannot be on your child when there is a
    lobby bustling with activity, a line of five or more guests checking in and out,
    someone on the inside line requesting more pillows or questioning a bill, and
    our outside lines are ringing off the hook. -- frustrated at the front desk'

    when my husband''s grandmother died two years ago, my mother-in-law, "shirley,"
    told us we could go through the items left in her mother''s house, take what we
    wanted, and then discard the rest. i took mostly kitchen stuff -- mainly pots
    and pans. my birthday was last week and i had to work late, so shirley came over
    and cooked dinner for me. a couple of days later, i was going to cook some lasagna
    and take it to her home, but after searching high and low, i was unable to locate
    a particular dish i used. finally, after going through every cupboard, i called
    shirley to ask where she had put it. she then informed me that since it was her
    mother''s dish, she had taken it. i was upset and told her i wanted it back. shirley
    told me no and hung up on me! my mother-in-law has not spoken to me since, and

    you printed a letter from "better safe than sorry," a woman who was reluctant
    to open her door to solicitors. her husband insisted that if she didn''t open
    the door and respond face-to-face, she was being rude. you advised that no rule
    of etiquette demands a person open the door to a stranger, and the way to avoid
    "buying" anything is to not listen to the pitch in the first place. i''d like
    to share what a police officer told us at our community watch meeting. he said
    that burglars often knock on doors to see if anyone is home. the way to handle
    a stranger at the door is to say loudly, "honey, i''ll get it," then ask through
    the door, "who is it?" even if no one is with you, it gives the impression that
    you''re not alone and vulnerable. -- helpful advice from plano, texas'

    last weekend i asked to borrow a glass pitcher from my sister for a party i was
    having. her husband arrived a few minutes before the party with the pitcher in
    hand. as he handed it to me, i noticed a large crack on the side. i pointed it
    out to him and gave it back. my sister called me later, asking, "what about my
    pitcher?" i explained that it had arrived damaged and that i was not responsible.
    she says i must replace or compensate her for it in some way, because the pitcher
    would not have left her house that day if i hadn''t asked to borrow it! abby,
    i''m not sure how the pitcher was handled during the four-minute car ride to my
    home. i do know it was placed unprotected on the front seat. the temperature was
    very cold that day, possibly in the single digits. my sister says the extreme
    variation in temperature between her house and the car and then into my house
    caused the crack. i consulted two well-known retailers. the customer service representatives
    from both companies said they had never heard of such a complaint from any of
    their customers. one went on to say that their company ships items through the
    mail daily, where products are exposed to outside temperatures, and still had
    no complaints from customers about receiving broken items. who is responsible
    for the pitcher? -- liz in e. greenwich, r.i.'

    i am a 27-year-old woman who would like to meet and date a man who respects women.
    two years ago, my husband and i were divorced. since then my dating experiences
    have been disappointing. my friends and acquaintances all say that meeting men
    in a bar is not a good way to find someone with whom i could be happy. i agree,
    because most of the men i have met in bars never call after the first date. they
    are unemployed, recently separated, or drop me after a few dates when i won''t
    have sex. i have contacted local parishes to find out about weekend retreats and
    charity functions, but dating men i met there didn''t bring any better results.
    i don''t understand why dating is such a problem. i''m blond, attractive and friendly.
    i work and attend college full time. i am ambitious, a voracious reader and can
    carry on an intelligent conversation. most men i''ve encountered seem happy to
    live at home with their parents and don''t want to start a family of their own.
    i''m looking for someone who would take me to dinner and a movie and treat me
    like a lady. i don''t mind staying home and watching movies sometimes, but men
    today apparently want only casual sex -- not relationships. unlike my girlfriends
    who are satisfied with bar-hopping every weekend for male companionship, i want
    to share my life with someone and have a family. i''m not asking for an instant
    marriage proposal, but i would like a meaningful relationship. have you any suggestions?

    this is my seventh year of marriage to a wonderful, loving and caring man. we
    were both widowed when we met. he has four sons and one daughter. the daughter
    does not approve of me, which is fine since she lives out of town. my problem
    is none of his children know how to introduce me. they always proudly introduce
    their father, and then they say, "... and this is ''doris.''" it makes me feel
    like i am a live-in instead of his wife. could you please tell me what the correct
    introduction should be so he can pass it on to his children? they are all grown
    and married, so they don''t want to say, "this is my stepmother," and that''s
    ok, too, i guess. my children say, "this is my mother and her husband, ''john,''
    or my stepdad, ''john.''" please help. -- stepmom in charleston, s.c.'

    does anyone know, or even care, how it feels to be a widow? with the exception
    of her children or other widows, i doubt it matters to very many others. i have
    tried to be outgoing, staying attractive and accepting invitations. i really looked
    forward to the recent wedding of one of my relatives. however, at the reception
    it did not take long for the loneliness to set in as i watched the couples dance
    with each other and with guests at other tables. throughout the entire evening,
    i hoped someone would ask me to dance. it never happened. there''s a song, "put
    on a happy face." i''m very good at it when people hurt me. i wore mine all evening.

    i know that good christians are supposed to practice forgiveness, but it''s not
    always easy to do. my husband, "carl," has been having an off-and-on affair with
    my brother''s wife, "joanne." i found out when i accidentally caught them together.
    carl begged me to forgive him. he said it was all a terrible mistake. we started
    marriage counseling, but all that came out of it was his confession that the affair
    had been going on for 15 years. when i confided it to my sister, she told me that
    joanne had tried to seduce her husband, too. over the years, i had felt uneasy
    about joanne flirting with my husband. i talked to them about it at one point,
    but they said i was being hormonal and it was only my imagination. i feel like
    a fool for believing them. i offered carl a divorce, but he insists that he loves
    me. he says he''s sorry and he wants to stay with me. we''ve been married for
    36 years, and have raised three boys and two girls together. we have seven grandchildren.
    carl and i are respected members of our community. we have been successful in

    all this. carl is begging me to give him another chance, but how can i ever trust

    i hope you''ll print this. many women will face what happened to me. they should
    be prepared. after 36 years of marriage, i finally confronted my husband about
    his cheating. i had remained silent for decades, hoping he''d change as he grew
    older. his response? he left me and filed for divorce. he said i had been a good
    wife, but he wanted to start a new life. thank the lord that before i confronted
    him, i had begun to get my affairs in order. i had been saving from my household
    allowance (i was a stay-at-home mother of four), knowing i''d need money to defend
    myself should he ever leave me. i gathered all the information i could about our
    finances and photographed all of our possessions. (we had numerous vehicles and
    rv equipment.) had i acted differently, i would have lost my share of our assets,
    as he tried to hide them. because i had prepared carefully, my attorney was able
    to uncover the hidden items and property. i also got my ged certificate, took
    nurse''s training and began looking for a job. i had already established credit
    in my own name, using my husband''s salary because i had none. (i did it at department
    stores, and used the credit wisely, never overextending it.) i did not confront
    my husband until i was prepared to take care of myself. nor did i rave or make
    a fool of myself. aware that my children still loved their father, even if they
    no longer respected him, i didn''t try to destroy him. i remained a lady through
    it all, so that if he came to his senses and realized our marriage was worth saving,
    i''d have no regrets about my actions. i also shopped around for a good lawyer.
    i confided only in trusted individuals, not mutual friends. i knew, above all,
    how important it was to be discreet. while i wouldn''t wish what i went through
    on my worst enemy, i''m glad i handled it the way i did. it took more than five
    years for me to recover. my life will never be the same. i lost my husband, my
    church, my last child left home, and i went through menopause -- all in one year.

    this morning to find a man angrily confronting one of the librarians. i don''t

    apparently, when it was his turn to be helped, he was on his cell phone and refused
    to hang up. she informed him that she would help the next person in line, and
    then help him when he had finished his conversation. part of his problem, according

    my husband''s cousin has a son, "johnny," who is almost 6. whenever we see johnny,
    he jumps all over my husband and hits him. we believe johnny is too old for that
    kind of behavior. my husband and johnny''s father repeatedly ask the boy to stop,

    my boyfriend, "lance," attends the naval academy in annapolis. we have been dating
    seriously for a long time and have made plans to start our life together when
    he graduates and heads off to flight school. i intended to leave my job, my family
    and friends to be with him. recently, out of the clear blue sky, lance told me
    he has second thoughts about our plans. he said his doubts stem from his concern
    for my best interests. he feels it would be too difficult for me to continually
    move over the years, and he would feel guilty asking me to sacrifice so much for
    him. i was caught completely off guard. i told lance that, because i love him
    so much, i want to give this new life a chance. we talked for hours, and he decided
    that although he loves me very much, his life belongs to the navy, and no one
    but he should make sacrifices. should i try to mend this relationship or let him

    my wife''s brother, "george," lives with us. it was my wife''s suggestion because
    he was homeless, and she didn''t want him on the streets in the cold weather.

    my 10-year-old son, "fritz," is lying to me. he is given 25 cents every school

    i am the happily married mother of 1-year-old and 2-year-old boys; "jonathan"
    is the older and "kevin" is my baby. because my elderly parents live close by,
    we make sure they see our children often. also, i make time every morning to talk
    to my mother. it has become clear to my husband and me that mom favors jonathan.
    when kevin was an infant, mom would literally step over him to get to jonathan.
    until it caused a rift, she would "jokingly" refer to kevin as "the other one."
    recently, kevin had a violent allergic reaction to some medication. mom''s first
    concern was how jonathan reacted to his little brother''s being ill. when i share
    a milestone with my mother, she is quick to compare kevin unfavorably with his
    brother. i could list many other examples. i am saddened, disgusted and furious.
    i have confronted mother more times than i can count. most times she denies it;
    sometimes she says she feels jonathan is just "special." the boys are still too

    my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years, "neil," broke up with me last august. at the time,
    i couldn''t understand why he suddenly changed so drastically. early in our relationship
    he had been accepting of my two children, but toward the end he became distant
    and cold to them. then he told me he didn''t want to raise another man''s children
    and wasn''t interested in being a mentor to a teenage boy. neil was also angry
    that i refused to end my relationship with my best friend, who happens to be a
    gay man. neil said there is no place in society for gays and he didn''t want a
    gay person calling his house. neil works for a company that he has always had
    an interest in owning. last spring, the owner died suddenly and left shares of
    the business to his widow, "nancy," and their children. neil told me he intended
    to borrow money from his family and buy out the youngest son''s interest -- but
    his family didn''t have the money to loan. about a month after that, in the midst
    of complaining to me about his financial woes, neil commented, "maybe i''ll get
    me a rich older woman to take care of me ... someone like nancy." over the next
    few months, i saw him less and less. little did i know neil had already manipulated
    a relationship with her. abby, nancy is a very nice, classy person. i like the
    woman. i went to her home for her husband''s wake. should i tell nancy what neil
    is up to, that he''s a conniving loser? i''m afraid if i do, she won''t believe
    me. neil can be very sweet when he wants to be, and i''m sure she hasn''t glimpsed
    his hateful, controlling side. his only real love is money and power. my motive
    is not spite. i don''t want neil back. i have a new boyfriend who is everything
    neil could never be. i just feel nancy should know what''s ahead. she has a gay
    teenage son. i''m sure when neil gets what he wants, that boy''s life will be
    hell. so, you tell me: should i talk to nancy and risk looking like sour grapes,
    or let her find out what a lowlife, gold-digging scumbag neil is for herself?

    i recently left my husband of 14 years, "derrick." now all of the people i thought
    were my friends will no longer associate with me. derrick and i were very good
    at pretending, so everyone thought we had a great marriage. now that i have moved
    out, they all think i just decided one morning that i no longer wanted to be married.
    what they do not know is that derrick raped me and put me through 12 years of
    emotional and verbal abuse. during one of the marriage counseling sessions i mentioned
    the rape, and he turned to me and said, "that was 12 years ago. get over it."
    that was when i decided to file for divorce. should i go to my friends and explain
    it to them, or just find new friends? -- lonely in wichita'

    my husband of 21 years, "robert," made me a wonderful dinner, made love with me,
    and then –- instead of sweet dreams -– he served me with divorce papers. he treats
    me like a princess, but the divorce is still going through. robert says we have
    nothing in common and no longer think alike. i am confused. he calls me two or
    three times a day, and cries and becomes angry when i say i am moving away from
    the house. he tells our adult children he "loves me dearly" but will never be
    truly happy with me. in a few more months we will no longer be husband and wife;
    however, he won''t let go emotionally. i am still hopelessly in love with him,

    my son, "adam," came home from iraq for a two-week visit. he brought with him

    family is huge, and adam didn''t have room to bring something for everyone. no
    one else in the family is upset about it. they''re just glad he came home healthy

    a card in iraq ordering him to send my mother something. it upset him because
    he barely knows aunt irene. when i defended my son, mother said: "i am the grandmother.

    i am a 26-year-old woman who has been married for a year and a half. after our
    wedding, my husband, "wendell," and i moved 2 1/2 hours away from my hometown.
    i have a job in the catering business and my husband is a successful attorney.
    i''m happier now than i have ever been. the problem is my mother, who has never
    stopped making me feel guilty about moving. recently, mom has become mean and
    offensive, saying maybe she should just forget about me rather than deal with
    the pain of my living so far away. she says she''d rather not see her future grandchildren
    at all if it''s going to be only once or twice a month. mother expects me to visit
    her whenever i have free time. she refuses to accept that i work full time and
    have responsibilities. i have tried to reason with her; her only response is that
    i should move closer. i know she misses me, but i feel she is being unreasonable.
    i know of many other parents who have supported their children moving away. i''m
    afraid i''ll lose my mother if i don''t move closer. can you give me some advice?

    i was dating a man for nearly a year, and it was wonderful until things started
    to unravel. after we had dated for several months and things were starting to
    get serious, he introduced me to his 7-year-old daughter, "emma." emma and i took
    to each other immediately and became great friends. she would call me on the phone
    and ask to hang out with me and her dad. sadly, things with her father and me
    didn''t work out, and i broke off the relationship. now i''m struggling to explain
    to emma why i''m no longer around. what is the best way to deal with this? i love
    emma and want to do what is best for her, and i don''t want her to think i abandoned
    her. but i think it would be best to ease my way out of her life so as not to
    add to her confusion -- especially when her dad''s new girlfriend comes along.

    my father is upset with me and my sister-in-law because we don''t ask his wife
    "clarice" -- who is a hairdresser -- to cut, color or style our hair. clarice
    primarily services middle-aged and older females, who usually request haircuts
    and styles far different from what we want as young women. she does a great job
    as a stylist on that particular kind of client, but we''re less confident in her
    skills with trendier styles and colors -- not because she''s incapable, but because
    you become expert at what you do every day. we have never discussed our feelings
    with clarice; for years we just got our hair done elsewhere. dad recently let

    i''m a 34-year-old professional woman who has never married. for the last two
    years, i have been dating "mel," the single father of 11-year-old "tracey." we
    live separately, but i''m at their house frequently, helping with and sharing
    meals, helping tracey with her homework, contributing to and buying groceries,
    doing dishes and other chores. i often sleep at mel''s and am involved in the
    evening "tucking in" ritual. it has been an enlightening and challenging experience
    for me. when i do things independently -- keep in mind that mel and tracey are
    almost always invited to participate in whatever i''m doing -- he often chooses
    to stay home. then he tells me it''s unfair that i get "all the freedom" and he''s
    stuck here with the kid again. mel has never had a baby sitter, although the parents
    of tracey''s friends were willing to have her on play dates a few times when we
    first started dating. i try to be fair and helpful, but it seems like mel resents
    me (or at least his life choices) for not always dedicating myself to "the family."

    the end of the relationship? -- cornered in montana'

    my brother-in-law, "fred," is on his fifth marriage. we know it won''t be his

    we could tell his new fiancee what we know about fred, but of course, we can''t.

    how many times he has been married. multiple previous marriages are a big red
    flag. don''t think you are different from the others. you''re not. (2) if you
    wonder how he affords the expensive wines, the five-star restaurants and the trips
    to europe on the salary that someone in his line of work earns -- the answer is
    he can''t afford it. (3) if he wants to buy a house with you and asks you to buy
    it in your name alone, then add his name after you obtain a loan, run for the
    nearest exit. his credit is bad. (4) "went to" a college and "graduated from"
    a college are two different things. what a shame that someone would even lie about
    that. (5) if he hasn''t been able to hold a job because he was "smarter than"
    every boss he ever had, don''t count on having his income in your budget. (6)
    are you much younger than he is? does he try to control your every move? (he likes
    the young ones because he can no longer fool the older, wiser ladies.) (7) have
    you ever wondered why nothing is his fault? the divorces? the bankruptcies? think
    again! (8) does he tell you that his accountant advises him to make expensive
    purchases (that he can''t afford) on the basis that they''re tax-deductible? don''t
    believe everything you hear. we know that fred is attractive and charming. but

    please print this cautionary tale of infidelity. it involves out-of-town professional
    conferences. in our small suburb, several marriages have ended on the basis of
    affairs that were born at these conferences. in my case, my husband of 35 years
    confessed that he''d had an "emotional affair" with a single, professional colleague
    that endured for 20 years. while it was never sexual, they wrote each other letters
    and love poems -- boxes of them. (she addressed them to his business p.o. box.)
    they also exchanged gifts, including some he purchased for her during our family
    vacations and smuggled home. the usual warning signs of infidelity were absent.
    there were no unexplained absences, no telephone receipts, no money missing from
    our joint account, no lipstick on his collars. the only clues were my husband''s
    defensiveness -- and his vague complaints about "something" wrong with our marriage.
    yet he refused marriage counseling. our sex life became passionless, our communication
    nonexistent. however, to the outside world, we appeared to be a model couple.
    my husband is ashamed and remorseful now. we''re finally seeing a therapist, who
    is helping us rebuild our marriage. however, 20 years of deception are difficult
    to overcome. my advice? if your mate is less than enthusiastic about having you
    accompany him or her on trips to professional gatherings, be suspicious. go to
    counseling on your own, if need be. and do not be as trusting and naive as i was.

    i was made for. i am 29 and shy by nature. before meeting "jane," i never had
    a long-term relationship. nothing lasted more than two dates. i never took the
    chance because i was afraid of getting hurt. jane, on the other hand, is the opposite.
    she has had boyfriends since the age of 13. we are both having trouble forgetting
    the past. although i know jane loves me and her ex''s mean nothing to her now,
    she still mentions their names in passing every so often. she still has photos
    of them, old letters, gifts, etc. it''s a constant reminder of her past, and of
    mine, which was alone and depressed. just thinking about jane in another man''s
    arms, and how alone i was, tears me up inside. why does she have these old things
    if i am supposed to be her true love? she never speaks of them with longing, but
    her talking about them at all is hurtful to me. how can i get past her past and
    move on with the present? -- wants no reminders'

    i was molested at the age of 9. it went on for about five years. eventually the
    man who molested me also raped me. i tried numerous times to tell my mother, but
    she would never believe me. i even went to the school counselor. my mother had
    a serious alcohol problem and didn''t seem to realize what was going on. "ronny,"
    the man who raped me, used to beat my mother until she was unconscious -- and
    then call me in and tell me it was my fault for telling on him, and that i should
    let him do what he wanted or he would hurt my mother again. because i was only
    9, i felt like i had to protect her. ronny has since passed away, but i am still
    scarred by what happened to me. my mother has never forgiven herself for not believing
    me, and i have suppressed much of what happened. i am scared that one day all
    of those memories are going to come flooding back and hurt me all over again.
    what do you think i should do? should i leave the memories buried, or find a way
    to get them out and move on? i have a very understanding man in my life, and we
    are engaged to be married. please help me. -- wants to move on in houston'

    how does one deal with a nosy neighbor? "miss nosy" looks through my mail, and

    read and apparently hoarded. i didn''t confront her because i had just moved next
    door and didn''t want to start a feud. miss nosy claims she goes into my mailbox
    to make sure our postman hasn''t accidentally put something for her in there.
    doesn''t she know that if he did, i''d give it to her? if someone comes to my
    door, miss nosy calls and demands to know who it is and as much about his or her
    life history as i''m willing to share. she also asks me questions that are far
    too personal. she is elderly, but i don''t think that''s a valid excuse for her
    behavior. renting a p.o. box would be inconvenient. i''m considering replacing

    an attendant. i visit the club almost every week, and sometimes i leave a tip
    and sometimes i don''t. one night i was merely looking at a bottle of cologne
    and the attendant screamed at me that i could use it only if i left a tip. another
    time, i saw a girl eat one of the mints, and the woman demanded money for it.

    i need to know if i should forgive my husband, "kurt," or move on and start over.
    i had been married 26 years when kurt called me one day at work to say he no longer
    knew how he felt about me. i was speechless. at first, i thought he was joking,
    but it went from bad to worse, and he asked for a divorce. he became verbally
    and emotionally abusive after that and moved out for a while. then we reconciled.
    everything was ok until a well-meaning friend called and told me kurt had been
    involved with the office slut for more than a year. when i confronted him, he
    lied, he cried, and then he spilled his guts. i get sick thinking of the way kurt
    treated me. he abandoned me for her like i was a weekend fling. he took money
    from us to support her, because she was "all alone and needed someone to help
    her out" -- all the while telling me that at age 44, i needed to learn to take
    care of myself! (i am a college graduate with a full-time job.) my feelings for

    i may have started a war with my neighbors. about two months ago, their son, "ricky,"
    smashed a brick on my van while it was parked in my driveway. the damage was estimated
    at more than $500. i asked ricky''s parents to pay for it because i had paid them
    $100 a few months before, after i accidentally ran over ricky''s bike in the driveway.
    they didn''t have to ask for the money -- i volunteered it. when i told my neighbors
    about the damage, they refused to pay, saying my daughter had gotten their boy
    upset over a ball game they were playing. they said i should take them to court
    -- so that''s exactly what i''m doing. after they were served with the court papers,
    they called my boss and complained that i had cut them off while driving my company
    vehicle, a school bus. it was an outright lie. things are starting to get out

    my son and daughter-in-law have a golf cart they allow their 6-year-old daughter,

    another dentist for a consultation. the other dentist is highly esteemed and not

    our family owns a bar in a resort community. i run it, along with my mom and two
    of my sisters. added to that mix is one of my brothers-in-law, "jeff." jeff is
    the problem. jeff manages the bar some nights, and he is becoming increasingly
    difficult to work with. he does a good job of managing in most areas. however,
    he is impossible to talk to. at the ripe old age of 26, he has become a know-it-all.
    if he thinks he''s being criticized, he becomes combative, bossy or defensive.
    he is also very sensitive, and frankly, very immature. i understand that jeff
    loves our business and is dedicated to his job, but the problem is the way he
    talks over everyone. he also likes to hold his position over employees, and his
    refusal to listen to what others have to say is making an impossible situation.
    if he wasn''t a part of the family, he would not be working here in his current
    capacity. i have tried explaining that he must choose his words more carefully,
    and that he needs to listen and be a part of the team rather than always "the

    daddy died a year ago. he was an avid sportsman who left behind a large gun collection.
    mama is planning to sell it, with the help of a close friend of daddy''s. this
    friend told mama a few weeks ago that he thought some of the guns were missing.
    after some encouragement, she filed a police report. to make a long story short,
    some of the guns were located in a pawn shop. the thief was my baby sister "jan''s"
    fiance. he admitted to mama that he took the guns a month after daddy died. he
    had a key to the house and found the key to the gun cabinet, which she had hidden
    in her underwear drawer. mama has not pressed charges because of my sister. jan
    claims she "loves" this felon. she says he is "so sorry" and "remorseful" and
    she knew nothing about the theft. abby, my sister''s 12-year-old daughter lives
    in the house with them, and her natural father is ignorant of this whole mess.
    jan says she and her fiance have been to a counselor, who told them they should
    stay together. mama now feels violated and unsafe in her own home. we find it
    unbelievable that jan can even look this guy in the eye, much less continue to
    live with him. her financial picture is not good, and our parents gave her money
    for years that they could not afford. i think the guy belongs in jail, but only
    mom can bring charges. as long as this thief is in jan''s life, our family will
    be in turmoil. what should we do? -- stabbed in the back in virginia'

    my husband and i both came from "the wrong side of the tracks," but have done
    better than the odds predicted we could for ourselves and our children. we have

    my parents split when i was 3 and divorced when i was 6. i am now 28. mama remarried
    when i was 7 to a man i consider to be my dad. my biological father, "kevin,"
    lived in the same town we did until i was 11, when we moved. (my stepfather was
    in the military.) communications and visits were rare before we moved and have
    been nearly nonexistent ever since. kevin never paid child support and only occasionally
    remembered birthdays when i was young. he called once a few years ago. the entire
    conversation was centered around his making excuses about why he was never around
    and never supported us. in the end, he blamed mama for it. he never once apologized
    for being a deadbeat dad or his lack of interest in my life. kevin called again
    a few months ago. i was civil to him although i didn''t offer much in the way
    of conversation. he said he and his wife had prepared their wills and that i was
    named in his. i simply said "ok" and didn''t ask any questions. kevin has called
    a couple of times since, but i have no motivation to return his calls. this week
    i got a birthday card from him in the mail -- two weeks late, of course. it contained
    a check for a small amount of money. i honestly did not feel any loss for not
    having kevin in my life because i was blessed with a loving, caring male parent.
    sharing dna does not constitute being a father in my book. but i think he at least
    owes me an apology or some kind of admission of wrongdoing (or lack of doing)
    if he expects me to be civil and communicate with him. should i return the check?
    should i cash it, and write a letter thanking him for remembering my birthday,
    albeit late? or should i tell him i am not willing to talk to him until he''s
    willing to offer me an apology? -- daughter who doesn''t need two dads'

    do you ever feel sometimes that your life is going backward instead of forward?
    in my early 20s, i had a life. i was engaged, going to college, hanging with my
    friends, loved my family, had standards for myself and goals in my life. as i
    have gotten older, i feel like all i have is a graduate degree, a good job, my
    health, a truck that''s paid for, and wonderful, generous parents for letting
    me once again live with them. (another relationship gone bad.) somewhere along
    the way, i kept losing the things that mattered to me, that kept me together,
    that made me who i was. and now, here i am at 28, and if i died tomorrow the only
    people at my funeral would be my family and some co-workers. i am lost and i can''t
    seem to find my way back. i don''t even recognize the girl in the mirror anymore.
    and the saddest thing is i am a licensed therapist, trying to help other people
    put their lives back together while i''m still searching for mine. ironically,
    i''m amazed at what i do and have a deep-seated passion for it. abby, how do you

    has it occurred to you that the girl who is being paid more might be a "value-added"

    in the sink for the parents to come home to? does she read to the kids, or even
    interact with them at all -- or does she take her job description literally and
    just sit? perhaps she''s paid less because the kids groan when told she''s their
    sitter because she ignores them and watches tv. i''d suggest dayna ask her friend
    to describe what she does when she baby-sits and try to match -- or exceed --
    these efforts the next time she''s asked to take care of the kids. i''ll bet that

    in your reply to "concerned mom," you pointed out that baby-sitting is a business.

    be some difference. before demanding a rate increase, i would ask my customer,
    "you have hired me several times; how can i improve my baby-sitting service to

    died only 90 days after being diagnosed with cancer. jason had been separated
    and divorced from his first wife, "carole," for many years before we were married,
    and had two adult children from that marriage. on the morning of jason''s visitation,

    storyboards, etc. and was acting as if they had never divorced. i was mortified

    i am a 35-year-old man, deeply and madly in love with a 36-year-old woman who
    has two kids. i''ll call her whitney. we would both like our relationship to lead
    to marriage and more kids, but something -- or rather someone -- has put a damper
    on things. whitney has been talking to this other man (who she thinks is gay)
    for quite some time. a few weeks ago, he finally asked her out. she declined,
    but did not tell him she''s involved with anyone else. when we discussed it, and
    when i told whitney he has crossed the line by asking her out, she argued that
    she is not attracted to him and he''s gay, and then she accused me of not trusting
    her. i am not a controlling person. i never minded her talking to him before he
    asked her out. but the fact that he did, and they talk to each other daily and
    she does nothing to avoid talking to him, makes me uncomfortable. it has shaken
    my trust in her. this has seriously affected our relationship, although she doesn''t
    realize it. i don''t want to see whitney get hurt by some guy who may be looking
    for just one thing. does this look innocent to you? can a gay man be attracted
    to a woman? and more important, can a woman be attracted to a gay man? - - confused

    i come from a family of seven kids that has been torn apart ever since the year
    our mother decided to leave our stepfather of 11 years to be with another woman.
    it''s not the fact that she chose to be gay; it''s the distance that came along
    with it. she has severed her relationship with all of us kids. mom has changed
    her phone number a few times already. when she has given it out to one of us,
    it was only after making us promise not to share it with any other sibling or
    family member. the same with her address. this has caused problems between siblings.
    some are hurt because they don''t understand why she doesn''t talk to them. i
    guess some of us borrowed money and didn''t pay her back -- and other similar
    things -- but she doesn''t even give us a chance to pay her back. a few weeks
    ago, i sent mom a letter apologizing for everything i have put her through, asking
    for forgiveness and telling her i''ll love her unconditionally. it has been more
    than two weeks since i mailed it, but still no reply. we live in the same city.
    i''d knock on her door, but i''m afraid i''ll be rejected. everyone tells me to

    i am a freshman in college. i just bought my christmas cards, but i need to know
    a little bit about proper etiquette in sending them out. my concern is regarding
    my friends who still live with their parents. would it be inappropriate to address
    the card only to my friends? would it be better to address the card to my friend
    and then write a short message inside along the lines of, "wishing you and your
    family a happy holiday"? i''m confused and want to do the right thing. -- lauren

    i am a single mother of a 10-year-old who also cares for my elderly mother at
    my home. i have had a lot of stress in my life and have gained a lot of weight.
    after much investigation, i decided to have weight-loss surgery to better my health
    and energy. i ended up financing the surgery with a no-interest loan for five
    years. i do not regret my decision; it has helped with my self-esteem and outlook
    on life. my problem is a friend of mine now shuns me. i suspect it is because
    she did not agree with my decision to pay for this surgery. she is being married
    this year, and i would never give her advice on how to spend her money on her
    wedding or otherwise. why would this person not be happy for me and support my
    decision that did not involve her? -- hurt in ohio'

    four years ago, i gave a bridal shower for our eldest granddaughter, "liz," one
    month before her wedding. two weeks later they canceled the wedding. liz did not
    return the gifts, nor did she write thank-yous for them. i was embarrassed by
    her lack of courtesy and appreciation to those who participated, as well as to
    me. liz is a college graduate. her mother, our daughter, knows better -- but apparently
    was not able to influence her daughter''s behavior. soon afterward, the local
    daily paper had a series of articles on the frequency of wedding cancellations.
    it specifically said that unused gifts were to be returned, and that thank-yous
    were to be sent. abby, if another wedding is planned, liz may expect me to host
    another bridal shower and include these same relatives. i plan to tell her that

    i am a well-educated, confident, attractive woman in my mid-30s. my job is in
    business development. my question is, do i need to be a social drinker in order
    to be successful? a male friend of mine often harps on how i make the other drinkers
    uncomfortable, and how people stay out late, drinking and discussing business
    deals until 3 or 4 in the morning. he says i must learn to have a drink or two
    -- otherwise i won''t be successful in getting any deals. i never criticize others
    who drink, and i quietly order fruit juice when others are drinking. no one beside
    this friend even notices it. but he often says loudly to the server that they
    should find some juice for me since i don''t drink. i have tried to learn to drink,
    but frankly, i don''t enjoy it. also, i have seen my friend and some of the other
    men indulge in somewhat loose behavior as they keep having more drinks. i think
    i''d be wise to refrain from drinking. my friend says because i am originally
    from another country, that i am "different." his remarks are wearing me down,

    myself to do it anyway. now when we''re at work, he acts like nothing ever happened.

    what has happened to professional courtesy in the workplace? i am a high school
    teacher, and recently a colleague learned that he was being replaced by another
    teacher when he read it in the school board minutes! the principal did not even
    extend the courtesy of telling him in person -- although his room and her office
    are only yards apart. abby, that teacher could have been applying for other jobs.
    another example: my daughter works in the television industry and is quite successful.
    months ago, she was contacted by a major network asking if she was interested
    in applying for an opening with them. they interviewed her twice, then flew her
    cross-country at their expense for a final interview, at which time she was told
    she would hear from them the following week. that was two months ago. is it that
    difficult for a prospective employer to call and say, "we offered the position
    to someone else," or "we haven''t decided yet"? finally, my son, a college student,
    was told he would hear in one week when he was to start a new job. that was five
    weeks ago. couldn''t the employer have been honest up front and told him that
    perhaps they wouldn''t need him right then? my son could have accepted another
    job and have been earning money instead of waiting. employers: prospective employees

    i have made a terrible mess. a couple of months ago, i had lunch with one of my
    father-in-law''s girlfriends. he was dating several women at the same time without
    their knowing about the others. during the eight years that i have known "frank,"
    he has been a selfish, womanizing, manipulative, controlling user. nor does he
    have a good relationship with any of his kids, including his youngest son, who
    happens to be my husband. during this lunch, i foolishly confided my true feelings
    about frank to the girlfriend. i mistakenly thought she would keep it between

    i have a friend, "karen," who was once married to "zack." they divorced and went
    their separate ways, but nine years later they are back together. i am almost
    certain they have not remarried, although karen uses his last name and refers
    to him as her husband. abby, zack is a compulsive womanizer, always on the lookout
    for a sexual encounter. karen doesn''t talk about it and pretends that everything
    is great with her and her "marriage." we all pretend along with her, although
    picking up strange women for sex is dangerous in many ways. i live on the coast,
    and a few weeks ago i drove south to a resort city to spend the weekend with a
    friend. as we sat in a restaurant, i noticed zack leaving. (i don''t believe he
    saw me.) i mentioned to my friend and an acquaintance of hers who was sitting
    with us that i knew the man who was walking out. the acquaintance laughed and
    said most of the women in the area knew him. it seems he owns a condo there and
    has attracted some attention because of his behavior. i said i knew about his
    womanizing. she replied, "yes, but are you aware that he picks up men as well?"
    i was stunned. the person who gave me the information seemed sure of what she
    was saying, and gave me enough details to convince me that zack is picking up
    men for sex as casually as he does women. i am afraid he is exposing karen to
    hiv, and i''m almost positive that she doesn''t know about his attraction to men.
    should i go to karen and tell her about this? i''m afraid of losing her friendship

    i could forgive myself. please advise. -- biting my tongue in n. carolina'

    at us because we didn''t ask her permission before inviting danny to come live
    with us. (he was already out of her house and living with my uncle at the time.)

    but the minute he got home he was right there to see what i needed. we spend a
    lot of time with our church family, and they love him, as do all his friends in
    the youth group. they invite him to hang out with them and think he''s a great
    kid. my problem is that my mother and siblings dislike my son. they think he''s
    lazy because he''s overweight, and they say he has no personality. they never
    liked his father and accused him of being "controlling." they think quinn is the
    same way. it started when he was a baby. they complained he was "too clingy" and

    attend, either. the last time i was at my parents'' house i got so upset that
    when mother left the room, i removed quinn''s pictures from the collage on the
    fridge and took them home. they don''t love him -- why should he be there? as
    i suspected, they haven''t even noticed, or they just don''t care. i''m considering

    larry and i have been married for 12 years. we have never kept secrets from each

    i was a single mom. my daughter and i lived in a poor neighborhood. it was raining
    and i didn''t have a car or money for a bus, so i hitched a ride. a man picked
    us up. he took us to her grammar school; i thanked him and got out. after i got
    my daughter inside, i went back out. the man was still there. he told me to get
    in and offered to take me where i needed to go. like a dummy, i got back in the
    car. he drove to a secluded area, parked, told me he had a knife and said he would
    kill me if i didn''t perform a sex act on him. i complied because i thought he
    meant what he said. later he drove me back downtown and, when he stopped for a
    light, i jumped out. i never looked back. i never told anyone, not even the police.

    i am a single mother of a 14-year-old boy, "todd," whom i have taught to be honest
    and open with me. todd and i are best friends, which is rare to hear these days.
    he is very smart, active with anything to do with the outdoors, and he also does
    very well in school. my problem is, todd is so open with how he feels that he
    comes across as being rude, argumentative and disrespectful. he tells me that
    he''s not trying to be, that he''s just voicing his opinion and how he feels --
    and that should not be wrong. in some ways, my son is right. but trying to teach
    him that there''s a time and place for his opinions has proven extremely difficult.
    i am proud to have a son i don''t have to worry about in the sense of lying, stealing,
    running around getting into all kinds of trouble. at 14, you''d expect some kind
    of misbehavior. but when he does get into trouble, it''s because of what he says
    -- not what he does. how can i undo what i have done, and teach todd that everything
    he thinks and feels should not fly out of his mouth the minute he has those thoughts

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am writing to you as a last resort. i have been married for 13 years to a man
    who does not communicate, to say the least. i have begged, pleaded, fought and
    waited for him to talk about something other than his children. now i have met
    a man who is divorced, and we have wonderful conversations. there is nothing more
    to it than conversation at this point. my question is, if lack of communication
    is the only thing wrong in a marriage, is it enough of a reason to end a marriage?
    i was always brought up to "hang in there" and make it work at all costs. i am
    at my wit''s end. -- just wanting to talk, woodbury, minn.'

    i know an older couple who seem to have an intractable problem. the wife, who
    now works part time, pursued painting as a hobby for many years. her husband does
    not like her paintings. almost every time i talk to him, he complains about the
    "junk" that his wife refuses to get rid of. i have suggested that he give her
    one room of the house (there is a spare bedroom) to do with as she wishes -- store
    her "junk," display her paintings, etc. he refuses, fearing it will become so
    cluttered that it won''t be usable for overnight guests. they rented a storage
    locker for several months, but the wife missed her things and brought them back.
    their arguments have brought them to the brink of divorce. have you any words
    of advice? mine seem to fall on deaf ears. -- anonymous in new mexico'

    my friend, "sarah," has been considering becoming a nun. she found jesus in the
    summer of 2003 and converted from judaism to christianity. she seems passionate
    about her beliefs, and i support her 100 percent. when sarah and i were in our
    teens, she was in a car accident that led to the death of a young man. although
    charges were never brought up, it was manslaughter, and i think she still feels
    guilty about it. do i need to report this incident to her clergy? would this prevent
    her from being able to become a nun? -- sylvia in san francisco'

    i am very concerned. i recently started seeing a man who refuses to kiss me. he
    will peck me on the lips or the cheek, but nothing more. i have asked him about
    it. he claims he has never kissed, and that it actually turns him off. i feel
    like because of this i can''t connect with him on a more intimate level. is this
    normal? please help. -- lipless lover in flagstaff, ariz.'

    i''m a college sophomore living in a dorm. my best friend lives a few doors down.
    we have always had a wonderful, caring friendship and many things in common. lately,
    however, she has not been spending much time with me. normally this would not
    concern me because we are both very busy right now -- but we recently had an argument
    in which i discovered her inability to handle confrontation. when i brought up
    my concern, it led to a fight. she burst into tears and said she can''t handle
    it when i "yell" at her. abby, i hadn''t raised my voice. later, more calmly,
    she told me she cannot handle confrontation and will never, under any circumstances,
    take the first step. this worries me, not only for our friendship, but for her
    own emotional health. when she doesn''t want to spend time with me, i wonder whether
    she''s angry with me and won''t say so. this could seriously affect her in her
    future friendships and romances. i tried to talk to her about addressing her fear
    of confrontation, perhaps through some sort of therapy. she doesn''t think she
    has a problem. i''d like to help her. am i right that this could cause her problems?
