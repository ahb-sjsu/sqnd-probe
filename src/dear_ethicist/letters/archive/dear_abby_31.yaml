    four years ago my best friend''s mother lost her husband after a battle with cancer.
    she joined a grief support group and met a man who had lost his wife to cancer,
    too. love blossomed and they will be married soon. everyone is thrilled they have
    found each other. along with a wedding gift, would it be appropriate to make a
    donation to a cancer charity in memory of their deceased spouses? i would like
    to honor the struggle that led the couple to each other, but don''t want to offend.

    a while back you asked your readers to name their heroes. may i contribute? my
    heroes are nameless, often faceless and in most cases unsung. they will never
    have 15 minutes of fame. their deeds won''t be recorded in history books, but
    their kindness inspires and their good deeds will forever affect the lives of
    others -- though some may not realize it. my heroes are parents, grandparents,
    aunts, uncles, cousins, foster parents, teachers, playground monitors and crossing
    guards who teach others to have values and common sense, and to be ethical in
    their treatment of others. my heroes are young girls who spend a year grooming
    and conditioning their hair, then cut it off so it may be given to a child who
    has none; those who pick up trash along the highways and byways to keep america
    clean; police officers who stop you because you''ve done something stupid, then
    let you go because they know you made an honest mistake and you''ll be sure not
    to do it again. my heroes are the guys on the garbage truck who take a few extra
    seconds to pick up the items that didn''t make it into the truck and make sure
    your receptacle is upright and undamaged before moving on to the next house; grownups
    who hold children''s hands in parking lots to keep them safe; teachers who stay
    after school to help a student struggling with homework, a troubled home life
    or homelessness. my heroes are strangers on streets and in buildings who take
    a moment to ask if they can help you because of the uncertain expression on your
    face; every shelter worker who has ever cried when a homeless or abused creature
    was euthanized; my dear father, whose strong hands, often bruised and bloodied,
    made a living for his family, who gently held his frightened little girl and who
    often shared more than he could afford with others less fortunate than he. these
    are my heroes. -- julie in scott city, mo.'

    a few weeks ago, my wife returned from a business meeting out of town. after unpacking,
    she took a bath. i happened into the bathroom just as she finished drying off.
    when she saw me, she grabbed a towel and held it over her shoulder and breast,
    but not before i spotted a hickey and bruise on her chest. when i asked her about
    the hickey, she said she had no idea what had caused it. after that, she refused

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    a number of things in the letter from "uneasy in indiana" (oct. 21) can be red
    flags for sex abuse. i have worked in child welfare for 35 years. abusers often
    start with "playful touching," comment about "cute" body parts, continue after
    being asked to stop, and make power statements that they can touch the child if
    they want. if the incident was innocent, why didn''t he recognize that it made
    his daughter uneasy and immediately stop when asked? "uneasy" already fears he
    may accuse her of being a paranoid former victim. abusers, when confronted, often
    accuse the other parent of "misunderstanding" or "being crazy." they may also
    accuse the child of misunderstanding the touches or being provocative. that "uneasy"
    and her husband don''t have sex is also of concern -- it can mean her husband
    finds children, not adult women, sexually desirable. even if "uneasy" isn''t sure,
    she should stop leaving the child alone with him. take her with her to class,
    leave her with a friend''s parents or a safe relative. let the husband know the
    touching and comments stop now -- no excuses -- and if there''s anything else
    of this nature she will report it to the authorities. the time to protect a child
    is before something happens. afterward is too late. children often tell only one
    time. if no action is taken, the child won''t tell again! -- seen it all in texas'

    sept. 11 was the 10th birthday of our neighbors'' little girl, "megan." at church
    that day there was a lovely memorial prayer for the victims of 9/11, but no mention
    of megan''s birthday among the other special occasions of the week. megan''s family
    went to the cemetery, put flowers on the memorial there and then went home. there
    was no party or cake for megan. when i took over a card and a small gift, her
    mom thanked me but said the day was too sad for megan to celebrate her birthday.
    she said they had never done so, not even on an alternate date. i don''t know
    this family very well. they''re new to the neighborhood. but i was flabbergasted
    that they would act this way. when i asked about the birthdays of the other family
    members, i was told that since none of them fall on a "bad day" they are celebrated
    with parties, gifts and everything. megan was allowed to accept my gift and thanked
    me, but her mom made it clear this was to be an exception to the rule. abby, what

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    over the past five years, family gatherings have become increasingly stressful.
    when they come here, my nieces don''t control their young children. last year
    after everyone left, i sat down and cried! the mess was horrific, and the damage
    to my house and yard was dumbfounding. what''s worse is they didn''t seem to care.
    i''m dreading this holiday season. i have refused to host anymore and my husband
    supports my decision. but i feel bad for my parents. they are in their 70s and
    have always had pride in their family. as our family has branched out, respect
    has gone completely out the window. last thanksgiving we were all on our own.
    we always invite my parents, but they decline because they don''t want to hurt
    any feelings. we have told them it doesn''t matter who they''re with, as long
    as they celebrate with one of us. i feel like i''m being punished for not having
    the whole family at my house. if it weren''t for my daughter, we would leave during
    the holidays to avoid the dissension. how do i deal with my feelings and live
    with myself? i don''t understand the disrespect in the young generation. if you
    say anything about a child''s behavior, you are verbally abused and made an outcast.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    twenty-four years ago, the international association of fire chiefs (iafc) and
    energizer spotted a disturbing trend. many fatalities were taking place in homes
    without working smoke alarms. in response, the "change your clock change your
    battery" campaign was developed to remind people to test and change their smoke
    alarm batteries each fall when they turn back their clocks at the end of daylight
    saving time. according to the national fire protection association, while 96 percent
    of american homes have at least one smoke alarm, 19 percent do not have at least
    one that works! the reason? missing or dead batteries. please remind your readers
    that when they set their clocks back on nov. 6, to use the extra hour they gain
    to change and test the batteries in their smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.
    it is recommended that smoke alarms be replaced every 10 years and be a mix of
    both ionization and photoelectric alarms to warn against all types of fires. they
    are the best defense against the devastating effects of a home fire. thank you,

    i''m a criminal. she makes me go to church every sunday. she makes me go to catholic
    school, and i have to wear an ugly uniform. she won''t help with my homework.
    she says, "i already did 10th grade." i can''t wear halter tops, short shorts,
    a bikini or much makeup. if i tell her it''s the style, she says, "modesty is
    always in style." when i go out with my friends, she wants to know where i''m
    going, who i''ll be with, what we''ll be doing, when we''ll be back and their
    phone numbers. if i have a date with a new boy, she makes him come into the house
    and tell her what school he goes to. then she makes him show her his driver''s
    license and car registration. i can''t keep my computer in my room. when i''m
    using it in the den, she looks over my shoulder and won''t let me go to chat rooms.
    i have to set the table even if we don''t have company and sit down and have dinner

    keep my room and bathroom clean. she makes me do unfair chores like clean the
    guest bathroom even though i never ever use it. she wants to teach me to sew and
    cook, but i have no interest in those things. she makes me visit dad every week,

    more than if she''d yell), "you can always choose to live with your dad." she
    told me as long as i live under her roof, i have to abide by her rules even if

    years ago, i placed my daughter for adoption. the circumstances that led me to
    make the decision were compelling. after 18 years, i was surprised and elated
    to hear from her. she''s 23, has a child of her own and is engaged to be married.
    i tried to maintain communication, but she stopped corresponding. after a period
    of not wanting to talk, she is now trying to get back in touch with me and her
    siblings. we''re unsure what to think about this and questioning her motives.
    does she truly want us to be involved with her and her daughter? or is this a
    way to get gifts for her child and her upcoming wedding? i would like to discuss
    this with her, but i''m hesitant for fear of losing her again. i always wanted
    a relationship with my daughter. i''m confused and afraid of being hurt again.

    my mom goes overboard with gifts for my two sons when she goes on vacation or

    "expect" grandma to give them stuff. the problem is she gives them random things

    in response to "n and e''s" request for a tip on how to let her boyfriend''s conservative

    to say nothing. if she''s asked directly, only then should she defer to the boyfriend
    to explain their unorthodox lifestyle to his parents. why does she feel the need
    to flaunt her private sexual relations? if she loves the two men, her actions

    i have been dating "carmen" for a few years, but in the last year she has started
    becoming violent when we are having an argument. i think this is domestic abuse,
    but she claims it isn''t because i''m a man. i''m not someone who can take abuse
    without repercussions. i''m like a mirror. if someone brings violence into my
    life, i reflect it back on them. so far, i have restrained my instincts -- but
    eventually i know carmen will cross the line and i''m going to snap. i have the
    potential to hurt her badly. i have tried everything to make carmen understand
    how i feel, but she continues to insist it doesn''t matter because i''m so much
    bigger and stronger than she is. when she hits me, it doesn''t hurt physically,
    but the anger i feel is indescribable. i''m at the end of my rope and considering
    breaking up with her before i hurt her. i don''t want to end the relationship,
    but i think it''s the only way to make her see things from my perspective. or
    should i call the cops the next time she hits me? -- bruised and abused boyfriend'

    i have been a holistic health-care and healing practitioner for 10 years. i love
    my work and being in a helping profession. i''m the one who is always there for
    everyone who needs help. a good portion of my work is as a counselor, teacher
    and shoulder to cry on. my problem? i''m lonely. i have multiple health issues
    and struggle with money. i need someone to talk with about me and how i''m feeling.
    whenever i find a counselor, member of the clergy, teacher, etc., i end up being
    the counselor, teacher, listener, whatever. living in a small town, it''s almost
    impossible to find anyone who doesn''t know me or my family. i went to a minister
    and ended up taking him to an aa meeting. i went to a counselor at a nearby university;
    she began asking me for advice about her health. i''m hesitant to try to find
    someone online. i''m not looking for a lover or an "adventure" -- just someone
    to talk with. my batteries are constantly being drained and opportunities to recharge
    are few and far between. i''m not asking for much, just someone to be there for
    me the way i am for many others. i tried talking with my wife about this, but
    she''s so emotionally insecure that even thinking i want someone else to talk
    with upsets her. please help me. -- lonely in a crowd'

    i appreciate frugality, especially now that we all have to watch our spending.
    however, my neighbor is incredibly frugal. she often asks if she can "borrow"
    something instead of buying whatever it is she needs. her latest request was for
    socks -- yes, socks! -- for her daughter''s dance recital. i put socks in the
    same category as underwear, something a little too personal to be lending out.
    before that, it was leggings, a cd -- the list goes on and on. she always returns
    the items, but enough is enough! i work, she doesn''t. i feel as though i''m expected
    to provide for them because i have a job. i don''t know if i should say anything

    my son, "beau," married "patsy" four years ago. she left him after two years and
    moved out of state. there are no legal separation papers, no child support, and
    my grandson lives with his daddy. beau has a mistress now and tells people they''re
    "engaged." "luci''s" family refers to my son as her fiance and she''s considered
    mommy to my grandson. when i corrected those titles at a recent family function,
    it caused friction. in my opinion, they can''t be engaged until beau is first
    divorced. to me, marriage is important; it matters. i am disturbed by my son''s
    refusal to end his marriage. i feel it is unfair to luci, who just had his second
    child. beau claims patsy left him, so she should file for the divorce. please
    understand that luci and i have become close. she''s thoughtful, intelligent,
    well-spoken, and a wonderful mother to both my grandchildren. i just feel beau
    should finish his first marriage. this is not the type of man i meant to raise,
    and that this is the person he has become shames me to my soul. am i out of step
    with society? am i the only one who finds this setup unfair to luci and insulting

    my husband and i were on vacation out of state with our four young children, staying
    at a large resort that offered a free buffet breakfast. while my husband tended
    to the children''s beverages and eating utensils, i stood in line to make waffles
    for everyone. (there were three waffle irons available.) as i made four waffles
    for the six of us -- as others were doing for their families -- a woman began
    berating me and another man for "monopolizing" the waffle irons. she said we should
    make only one waffle at a time and then get back in line. she went on to insult
    our kids by saying that by feeding our kids whole waffles for breakfast, we are
    responsible for the epidemic of childhood obesity in this country. was i being
    rude? is there a rule of etiquette regarding waffle-making in a buffet? we like

    two weeks before our youngest child''s wedding, my husband of more than 40 years
    suddenly became obsessed with worry that i was unfaithful. it was unfounded and
    nearly ruined the wedding for both of us. this continued for two weeks after the
    wedding, until he finally vowed to "let it go." my husband is now bending over

    i am a college student. in order to save money on housing, my best friend, "keira,"
    and i decided to get an apartment together. she''s engaged, so it''s actually
    the two of us and her fiance, "bruce." all of us were enthusiastic about the idea.
    they moved in a few months before me because i had a job back home and their jobs
    were at school. because they moved in first, they treat me as if it is "their"
    apartment and i merely have a room there. when i try to buy things for the apartment,
    such as a new tablecloth, bath mat, etc., keira immediately undoes any changes
    i have made when i leave for the day. i feel it is her passive-aggressive way
    of undermining me. it happens every day with something. this may seen petty, but
    this is my apartment, too. i pay rent just as they do, and i want to feel at home
    here as well. keira is stubborn and wants things her way. how can i get her to
    quit this behavior without causing further animosity within our home? -- home-less

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my mother passed away recently. my sister, who lives in another state, flew in
    with her 4-year-old daughter, "nikki," to attend mom''s wake. when the wake ended,
    nikki began to place stickers on mom''s hands and one on her face. the stickers
    had been given to her by another guest before the service started. when my 18-year-old
    daughter saw what her cousin had done, she removed them, and nikki threw a tantrum
    and refused to leave the casket. my sister spoke quietly to her, trying to get
    the child to leave, then allowed her to put at least two more stickers on my mother''s
    hand. finally, i gently picked nikki up and took her away from the casket. my
    father is a mild-mannered man and, although he frowned in disapproval, he said
    nothing. this has caused a huge rift between my sister and me. i feel a 4-year-old
    is too young to attend a wake. nikki should not have been allowed to put stickers
    on my mother. my sister says i "undermined" her parenting and had no right to
    intervene. what are your thoughts? -- saddened in new jersey'

    i was recently on a full three-hour flight. i was assigned an aisle seat instead
    of a window seat where i would normally sit. when my seatmates -- a couple --
    came to take their seats, they were too large to fit so they lifted the armrests
    to squeeze in. the man said he''d have to keep the rests up and joked that he''d
    hold his breath so he wouldn''t spill over on me. as the other passengers boarded,
    i walked back and asked the flight attendant if something could be done. she said
    the gate attendant could remove the couple and have them each purchase a second
    seat. i was mortified that they''d be paraded through the plane because of their
    size, so i said i''d grin and try to bear it. big mistake! the husband was in
    my seat the entire flight. i hugged the armrest in the aisle, which meant everyone
    who walked by bumped me. i couldn''t watch the movie or recline my seat because
    i no longer had access to the other armrest with the controls, and it was impossible
    to lower my tray table because it would have rested on his arm. abby, it shouldn''t
    have been my responsibility to be the bad guy and object to sharing the seat with

    our daughter "bree" has just announced that she''s pregnant with her third child.
    her other children are 1 and 2. my wife and i are in our 60s and provide chi1d
    care three days a week, while the other grandma baby-sits for two days. we also
    pay for preschool and swimming lessons, as well as cook dinner for them on the
    days when we baby-sit. bree and her husband do not earn enough money to support
    even one child. we know we''ll be expected to finance college for the children.
    when we agreed to help out, we asked them to promise they would not have more
    than two kids. this third one will cause us to use up our savings, increase our
    child care responsibilities and take us into our 80s to continue helping. is it
    wrong to feel used? i am very depressed over this. -- overwhelmed in san diego'

    my fiance, "johnny," and i have been together for four years and engaged for 16
    months. our wedding is in a few months. until recently, johnny didn''t have access
    to a car. that means for the past four years i have done all the driving, including
    visiting him at school two hours from my home every three to four weeks. it didn''t
    bother me because it was out of johnny''s control; his money went to pay for his
    education. however, because he has a car now, i feel it''s reasonable to ask that
    he do most -- though not all -- of the driving. we live in the same town now and
    our homes are a mile apart. johnny seems to take offense at the suggestion and
    acts as if i am "punishing" him. i''m not, but i''m tired of driving all the time

    for him. she tells him what clothes to wear to events and even irons them for

    my wife and i have been married for 10 years, and it is a wonderful marriage.
    we love each other very much, never argue and get along great. we have a 2-year-old
    child. recently i found a "sex tape" online of my wife with the guy she dated
    before me. this video was taken without her knowledge and is from 13 years ago.
    because of this, i am not upset about it. my question is, should i bring this
    to her attention, and if so, how? i feel she needs to know it''s out there. i''m
    reacting to this as a man would. i don''t know how a woman would react. please
    help. -- it''s private'

    i love my husband and, for the most part, we get along great. my only complaint
    is he stays neutral when someone hurts my feelings. the latest incident involved
    good friends of ours until the wife hurt me for the last time. she has a history
    of inviting me out, even talking me into changing my plans, then ditching me if
    something better comes along. this last time, i was invited to her house, only
    to learn (as i''m walking out the door) that she had left for the evening. i''ve
    had enough! i gave her as many chances as i did only because my husband said i
    "overreact" and shouldn''t let it be a big deal. this isn''t the first time he
    has chosen not to validate my feelings. the fact that my husband is never on my
    side hurts me more than what my "friend" has ever done. am i right? -- gets no

    your response to "not ungrateful in san diego" (july 13) missed the mark. her
    boyfriend of eight months is flying in business class to france, but he''s only
    paying for a coach ticket for her? i was a divorce lawyer for 31 years (now retired),
    so i know a few things about relationships. while claude had no obligation to
    pay her way to france, once he invited her, he displayed a troubling character
    flaw. if he was going to pay her way, he should have paid for her to sit with
    him in business class. her seat in coach is a warning sign: she''ll always be
    in the back of the plane, the bus or his life. of course buying business class
    seats for the two of them is expensive, but if he''s going to take her to his
    family''s chateau, he should treat her as an equal -- or not do it at all. --

    my new doctor has told me i''m considered morbidly obese. we discussed the yo-yoing
    weight problems i have had since i was a child, and she said i''d be a good candidate
    for gastric bypass surgery. my husband is super-supportive of the idea and so
    is the rest of my family. my mother even suggested i encourage my sister -- who
    is even heavier than i am -- to research it. but when i mentioned it to my mother-in-law,
    "evelyn," she was not thrilled. evelyn is the only other overweight person in
    the immediate family here in maryland. i suspect that she doesn''t want to be
    the only heavy person in the family if i have the surgery. her husband wants to
    be active and do things. he does them with my husband and me because evelyn can''t.

    a shattered ceramic bowl her son had thrown like a frisbee. "it''s not replaceable,"
    i told her. "it belonged to my great-grandmother." her response was that i should
    have put anything valuable out of reach. it seems even the most polite suggestion

    when i ended it because of a false promise. when we first started dating, he offered
    to fly me wherever he was due to be working. his job requires a lot of travel.
    it never happened. every year around this time he''s back home in california to
    work the harvest at his ranch. we made plans for me to fly there to see him and
    meet the rest of his family. a month ago i asked what was going on with the purchase
    of my plane ticket. i never got an answer, so i asked again two weeks later. albert
    made some excuses and said it wasn''t a good idea for him to pay for my flight
    there. after our break-up, he admitted his brother had convinced him it wasn''t
    right for me to fly there at albert''s expense and, if i loved him i''d find a
    way to pay for it myself. i''m a single mom. albert knows my financial status.

    may i weigh in on the letter from "noah''s real dad in new york" (june 27), whose
    adult adopted son wants to reclaim his original last name? i am an adult adoptee
    who searched for and found my birth family. i also joined a support group that
    was formed to support the adoption triad. research has shown that male adoptees
    struggle with their identity more than females do. after all, in our patriarchal
    society it is the male surname that most often does not get changed in marriage.
    women are accustomed to the fact that they will most likely change their name.
    this family needs to do some reading on the subject, there are many resources
    out there. a family counselor who isn''t well-educated about adoption issues will
    not be helpful. unless you walk in an adoptee''s shoes you cannot judge their
    actions. after all, the adoption decision is made without the consent of the child.
    we also resent being treated like children after we are adults. noah is a 34-year-old
    adult able to make his own choices and decisions. noah is fortunate that he knows
    his birth father and didn''t have to search a bureaucratic maze to obtain any
    information. laws have been passed in several, not all, states allowing adoptees

    changing his current surname. doesn''t noah realize his biological father was

    rights to his last name? if noah doesn''t respect his adoptive father for giving
    him his last name, and if noah is set on changing his surname, it would be more
    respectful to take his mother''s maiden name as his surname. i hope noah reconsiders

    after years of abuse at the hands of my mother''s boyfriend, i finally sought
    therapy to deal with the emotional issues. i spent weeks interviewing licensed
    therapists and finally picked one i felt comfortable with. after several sessions,
    i finally revealed the true nature of my issues. her response? "at least you weren''t
    raped!" i was so horrified by her reaction that i got up and walked out. it had
    taken me 20 years to finally work up the courage to speak to someone about my
    problems. now i feel completely defeated -- even exploited -- all over again.
    i know not all therapists are as inept as this woman was, but i''m really afraid
    of the whole process. what do you do when therapy is the one thing you need, but
    also the one thing you are petrified of? -- needs therapy for therapy'

    i am the proud father of a wonderful 7-year-old boy, "aiden." his mother, "emily,"
    and i share custody and have an amicable relationship. i also happen to be gay.
    most of our friends and family are aware of our situation and are kind to all
    of us. however, emily''s cousin "lyn" has children aiden''s age who are starting
    to make anti-gay comments to him -- including teasing and name-calling. i have
    spoken to lyn about this in a gentle and patient manner, but she told me the comments
    are reflections of her religious beliefs. have you any advice as to what i can
    do to stop aiden from being subjected to this kind of behavior, short of refusing

    my friend and roommate "kristina" is a great person with a big heart. however,
    one of her "quirks" is starting to bother me, and i''m not sure how to deal with
    it. kristina is an extremely picky eater who is repulsed by any ethnic food. i
    am asian, and if we pass an asian restaurant (or any other ethnic restaurant,
    for that matter) she makes comments like, "how can people eat that?" or, "that''s
    disgusting!" when i have pointed out to her that her attitude can be insulting,
    she casually apologizes but her behavior continues. i realize kristina is set
    in her ways and that there''s probably nothing i can do to change her attitude
    toward cultural cuisine. i feel like a nag every time i suggest she''s being insensitive.
    do you have any suggestions as to how i can respond to her disparaging comments?

    a younger brother died of cancer four years ago. recently his wife, "kaye," has

    my fiance, "roger," died recently. i am working through the devastating grief
    of his passing, but the core of my pain was listening to the eulogies at his funeral.
    i expected roger''s friends and family to share happy memories and celebrate the
    best of his life. however, many of those who spoke -- including his granddaughter
    -- chose to remember him as a notorious womanizer both while his wife was alive
    and after her death. stories were shared about how he constantly hit on much younger
    women, including his daughter''s childhood friends. one "gentleman" even shared
    an "amusing" anecdote about how he and roger found out they were sleeping with
    the same woman. i knew about roger''s past before he met me and i managed to come
    to terms with it, but i did not expect it to be brought up as entertainment at
    his memorial. i also thought it to be inappropriate with his late wife''s family
    in attendance. now my memories are tainted, and i feel dirty and used. i live
    500 miles from roger''s home and will probably never see those people again. what

    after a messy divorce, i moved with my 17-year-old daughter "allie" to florida.

    a little too much. shane lives with his parents down the street, and he''s often

    of "preening." i have the feeling he does it to gain my attention. the other day,
    after jumping in the pool, he surfaced without his swim trunks and said the pool
    jets had ripped them off him. then he got out of the pool and put them back on
    in front of me. when i told him i found the situation embarrassing, he shrugged
    and smiled, leaving me feeling awkward. being from the midwest, i''m used to people

    getting legally attached and not allowing yourself to become pregnant by a man

    a young bride-to-be who signed her letter "touchy decision in ohio" (june 18)
    prefers her stepdad walk her down the aisle at her wedding, but is worried about
    what her biological father (whom she sees once or twice a year) and other relatives
    might think. in my many decades on this earth, especially during the last 10 or
    15 years, i have seen all sorts of changes in wedding etiquette, including the
    customs governing who walks down the aisle. in addition to fathers escorting daughters,
    i''ve seen brothers escort sisters and children walk their mother to the altar.
    in "ohio''s" case, the logical solution, and the more appropriate one, to me,
    would be to have both gentlemen escort her down the aisle, one on either side.
    what could be lovelier? the bride-to-be should consider that the hurt feelings
    that often crop up on sensitive occasions such as this, if not attended to beforehand,

    i''m in a real pickle. my ex-wife, "gloria," and i have been divorced eight years,
    but have managed to remain civil to each other. last year, my daughter had a big
    birthday party to which i wanted to bring a date. gloria decided that she would
    not attend because it would be "hurtful" to see me with another woman. after my
    daughter called me in tears, i canceled my date and went to the party alone. now
    my daughter is about to be married and i want to bring a date to the ceremony.
    again, gloria has announced that she will forgo the pleasure of seeing our daughter
    get married "so i can have my way and prove to the world i''m able to get a date."
    my daughter is caught in the middle and wants us both there. i foresee a host
    of problems in the future if gloria''s behavior continues. my girlfriend is understanding,
    but i wish i could include her in family activities, especially one-of-a kind

    sometime ago, you printed a letter from one of your readers who was upset over
    her son''s polyamorous relationship. i didn''t respond then, but now that my triad
    is ready to come out to my boyfriend''s family (we are out to mine and to my husband''sâ·family),
    i feel the need to address this lifestyle in your column and ask your advice.
    my husband and i have been together 10 years. we started out as swingers. when
    we met my now-boyfriend, it became apparent that it was going to be more serious
    than "play" partners. our particular arrangement is a "v" triad, meaning i am
    involved with two (husband and boyfriend), but they are not involved with each
    other. my boyfriend is extremely important to us in every way. we all work together
    to make a very smooth-running, loving household. i want you and your readers to
    know that this is a viable relationship with love, respect and, most important,
    open communication. this kind of relationship -- or any, for that matter -- is
    doomed without it. an estimated half-million people in the united states are part
    of polyamorous relationships. we''re not freaks in need of counseling, but people
    who realize that love can grow and that there is an alternative to monogamy. abby,
    i would like to get some tips from someone who doesn''t readily accept this life
    or even know it''s out there. my boyfriend''s family is conservative and they
    know he lives with a married couple. we''ve all spent time together, and i think
    they like me. of course, they don''t know i''m romantically involved with their
    son. what''s the best way to tell them about our triad? we want them to know this
    isn''t the end of the world and that i love him very much. i''d appreciate any
    advice from you or your readers on this. until we''re out of the closet, please

    my friend "sarah" is married to "karl," who emotionally abuses her. my husband

    from our circle because we can''t tolerate the way he treats her. sarah has asked
    me not to drop her because she has very few friends left. she stays with karl
    because she''s afraid she''ll lose too much financially if they divorce. i have
    tried to tell her that her happiness should outweigh her desire for material things,

    and does nothing but drink and belittle sarah. he''s also hostile to her adult

    goes to their home because he doesn''t want them around. abby, this is a career

    my daughter, "kate," is 27 and has a 3-year-old son. she and the father are not
    married. he is self-centered, controlling and keeps her stranded. she has no car
    and no money. they currently live with his family -- a far from ideal situation.
    i am struggling because i''m unable to help her financially, and she feels lost
    and alone. my husband (her stepfather) won''t allow them to live with us, which
    i understand. we''re scrimping to get by. i have located several online sites
    for single moms regarding assistance, but i feel it is up to kate to pursue them.
    what else can i offer her regarding steering her in the right direction? if she
    could contact others in her situation, perhaps they might point her in directions
    i cannot. your advice would be welcomed. -- grandma in prescott, ariz.'

    i am a 40-year-old man with a baby face. it makes me appear much younger than
    i am -- so much so that i have been carded when buying alcohol or lottery tickets.

    months ago i grew a beard, which makes me look more my age. i''m an actor, and
    in the past audiences had difficulty accepting me in certain roles because of
    my youthful appearance. my beard solved that problem. my sister-in-law is getting
    married this summer and insists i shave my beard for the ceremony and wedding
    photos. i keep it well-groomed, and it gives me more confidence when dealing with
    people. i don''t want to shave it. my sister-in-law is recovering from cancer,
    and my wife thinks i''ll look like a jerk if i refuse to comply. i''m not part

    is it ok for a married woman to physically touch someone of the opposite sex?
    when we were in a restaurant, my wife reached toward the waiter and put her hand
    on his arm. at a football game, she leaned over and touched a kid on his shoulders
    with both hands to express her feelings about one of our grandsons scoring a touchdown.
    she also has a habit of calling other males "hon." is this normal? i have told
    my wife a number of times that she should stop it, but she says i don''t "own"
    her and she can do whatever she wants. -- annoyed husband in illinois'

    i''m a 17-year-old female senior in high school. i was coerced into sex when i
    was 12 by a 19-year-old neighbor. he raped, molested and beat me repeatedly for
    two months. i come from a religious family. i was very sheltered and didn''t understand
    most of what was happening at the time. it wasn''t until i had sex ed that year
    that i fully understood. mom had always told me not to let anyone touch me because
    it was dirty and wrong. i felt guilty because i knew "something" was wrong. when
    i told my neighbor about the guilt, he taught me how to cut myself using a razor
    blade. i never told my family (or anyone else, for that matter) about what had
    happened to me, and i continued cutting until last year when my mom found out.
    i have been in and out of counseling since then. i have horrible nightmares nearly
    every night. i relive memories of him beating me, molesting me and raping me.
    the nightmares are getting worse, and i''m falling asleep during the daytime.

    there''s a venomous old woman who roams through our neighborhood looking for victims
    to embarrass, humiliate or annoy. she told a neighbor''s 11-year-old granddaughter
    she looked like a slut because she was wearing shorts currently in fashion for
    the young. she habitually cuts in front of people in line at the supermarket,
    puts 25 items on the 15-item service line, etc. a new neighbor thought she should
    be treated with a little kindness. she had her opportunity recently when we were
    out to breakfast at a restaurant. the harridan sat alone (her husband refuses
    to be seen in public with her), and my friend commented to her on the beautiful
    day. her response? "don''t waste my time with meaningless inanities!" she then
    proceeded to abuse the server by repeatedly sending her plate back, each time
    becoming more unpleasant. the girl ended up in tears. at that point, my friend
    walked over and said quietly, "i hope you don''t think your advanced age justifies
    your meanness." the witch accused my friend of "slandering" her and left vowing
    never to return. this elicited a round of applause from the customers and staff.

    cancer or a house fire). adopting a child is a choice. i live paycheck-to-paycheck

    i''m a 19-year-old student who works. recently, i was talking with a co-worker
    about life, the economy and tough times. as we conversed i mentioned that i use
    hand soap as shampoo and body wash to save money. a few days later, during my
    lunch hour, i found grocery bags containing toiletries in the back of my vehicle.
    i didn''t say anything about it to him, but he mentioned "seeing someone" put
    something in my car. i feel uneasy about this. i didn''t mean to throw a pity
    party. i''m unsure whether to accept this "anonymous" gift. it was a nice gesture,
    but i don''t want it to become a regular occurrence. should i say something? --

    when i go out to eat with my girlfriends, i usually enjoy myself until it comes
    time for dessert. then i get grief if i don''t order any and they do. they''ll
    say, "oh, you''re so tiny. you can eat it." conversely, if i do order something,
    they tell me, "well, i''d love some but my metabolism isn''t as high as yours."
    i have never made comments to them about calorie counting, needing to work out
    or concern about my weight. i feel fitness is a private matter, and i''m not comfortable
    with mine being the topic of discussion. is there any way to respectfully and

    is it weird to not want to sleep in the same bed with my husband? we have an amazing,

    he prefers to cuddle all night. i always end up trying to push him over to his

    "keeping it real" is living in a fantasy world -- a sad one at that. our country

    we have a problem -- our pastor. he uses the pulpit to criticize, put people down
    and offers no compassion. a person can only take so much. the problem is, if you
    say anything to him, you can bet the next sermon will be about what you discussed.

    i have been dating "claude" for eight months. we are planning a trip in the fall
    to visit his family''s chateau in france. claude has long legs and refuses to
    travel in coach because it''s uncomfortable, so he will buy a business-class ticket
    for himself and a coach ticket for me. while i''m grateful claude is paying for
    my ticket, i feel that since we''re a couple, we should travel together. i don''t
    want to be upgraded to business class necessarily, but i''d like him to sit in
    coach with me. when i brought this up, he refused and is now calling me "ungrateful."
    my feelings are hurt, and claude can''t understand why i am upset. my friends
    and family think he is acting rude and selfish. i can''t help but agree. do i
    have a right to be upset? i am so uncomfortable with this arrangement that i''m

    when my husband, "ken," proposed three years ago, he had a steady job with an
    income twice as high as mine. he was laid off before our wedding, but we went
    ahead with the marriage. after our wedding, ken was unemployed for another year
    before finally finding a minimum wage job. after one year at that job, he was
    fired. he has since found another minimum wage position. i am a young teacher.
    we live in an expensive part of the country. we struggle every day to pay for
    groceries, gas and other essentials. i wasn''t raised to expect many frills in
    life and i am frugal, but there are certain things i always assumed i would have
    -- a house of my own, children, a savings account. if i stay with ken, i don''t

    my best friend, "beth," has finally found her "mr. right" after almost 35 years
    of singlehood. she is being married soon and i am thrilled for her. over the last
    15 years, i have been her sounding board. i have been through every date, every
    kiss, every heartbreak and every broken engagement with a string of men. beth
    has invited me to the wedding, but she hasn''t asked me to stand up for her. because
    we live 2,000 miles apart, we talk frequently on the phone and i keep waiting
    for her to ask, but she never brings up the subject. it''s like the elephant in
    the living room. beth knows i can afford the trip, so money isn''t a concern.
    should i tell her my feelings are hurt or ask her who is going to stand up for
    her? or should i follow my husband''s advice and just "let it go"? -- broken-hearted

    i''m a 22-year-old senior in college. much of college social life revolves around
    alcohol. i have no problem drinking responsibly, but i take medication that prohibits
    me from imbibing alcohol. strangers and friends often ask, "why aren''t you drinking?"
    they either assume it''s for religious reasons or i''m uptight. saying i''m on
    meds seems like a bit of a buzz-kill. this is particularly troublesome when i''m
    invited "out for drinks" at a bar. i never know what to order or say. i hate feeling
    like i''m obligated to drink, but i don''t want to pass on events because of the

    we live in a very nice neighborhood frequented by walkers and runners. for the

    bins have lids and our bin is never left open, which means these women must be

    i have been happily married for six years. my husband is kind, caring and honest.

    it down the drain, etc. i have tried wearing it around my neck, but it just gets
    in the way. my husband wears his ring every day and says he doesn''t mind if i
    don''t wear mine because he trusts me. my problem is other people. my co-workers
    are suspicious. my family thinks it''s "strange." men have hit on me, and when

    i''m a 16-year-old gangbanger looking at spending the rest of my life isolated
    in a little bird cage. every day i ask myself the same question. was it really
    worth throwing my life away? all i did was help a "homeboy" from getting hurt.
    i got caught and was convicted on eight charges that led to more than four consecutive
    life sentences. that ain''t no joke! the sad part of it is that the so-called
    homeboy turned his back on me when i needed him most. i should''ve pulled away
    when i could''ve. the main reason for this letter is to help parents and teens
    like myself who are choosing the wrong path to realize what you''re getting into
    while there is still time. tell parents out there, if you see your kid is messing
    up in school, using drugs, hanging with the wrong crowd, anything that would lead
    to gang affiliation, reach out and help them while you still can before they''re
    in too deep. they (teens) turn toward gang life in search of the love they need
    from their family. or they want to fit in and be cool. to all the gangbangers
    who think you''re cool and being a gangster, get away from it while you still
    can. it may be fun at the moment, but it''s not when you get caught and you have
    to spend the rest of your life behind bars. there''s better things to do in life
    than hang around all day frying your brain from all the drugs and alcohol. trust
    me, when you''re behind bars thinking about what you did, you''ll be missing your
    family the most. you think your homeboys are going to be there for you? well,
    let me tell you this ... they''re not! i guarantee you that the only people who
    are actually willing to change places with you are your parents. your real family.
    do you think your homeboys want to do time for you? hell, no! i hope this letter
    helps some people out there. i just want to make a contribution to society before
    i get locked up in the dungeon forever. this is to show you not all gangbangers
    are evil and cruel. life is short. live it smart, not stupid. now i can finally
    answer the question i ask myself, "was it all worth it?" the money, the girls
    and all the material things go faster than you think and could all be taken away
    with the snap of a finger from the split second of a decision you make. it''s
    not worth your life. -- homesick homeboy'

    our daughter is divorced with two children. she has been dating a man who has
    three children. recently, they decided to move in together. all the children are
    first grade or younger. what would be the proper way to handle birthdays? if my
    daughter and her boyfriend were married, or even engaged, i wouldn''t have a problem
    sending gifts to his children. but since my husband and i hardly know this man
    (we live in another state and have met him only once or twice), we''re not sure
    how to handle this. should we just continue to send birthday gifts to our daughter''s
    kids and nothing but cards to his? or would that look bad? what''s the proper
    thing? -- fair-minded in west virginia'

    i couldn''t believe your response to "stumped and trumped in ohio" (may 12). you
    made a point of saying to the father that his daughter and her boyfriend are in
    his house and they should abide by his rules and sleep in separate bedrooms. it''s
    his wife''s house, too, and she thought it was fine for them to share a room.
    since when should the man''s opinion automatically trump the woman''s? furthermore,
    what about hypocrisy? he admitted that he and his wife were indulging in "premarital
    mambo," as he so quaintly puts it. in this day and age, you can assume his daughter
    and the boyfriend are as well, especially since they wanted to stay in the same
    room. so it was ok for him, but it''s offensive when they do it? nonetheless,
    it is the parents'' house. if they had mutually agreed that the youngsters should
    sleep in separate rooms, so be it. this is something the husband and wife should
    have worked out together before "julie" brought her boyfriend home for a visit.
    but in saying it''s the man''s house and everyone should abide by the man''s rules,
    you insulted women everywhere. -- burned up in springfield, n.j.'

    because my 90-year-old mother is homebound, she qualifies for a meal program through
    a senior charity service. the program is free of charge for those in need. she
    didn''t like some of the meals, so she asked me to give them to my father-in-law,
    "louis." louis is 88. he still drives and is well-off, so he doesn''t qualify
    for the program, but he accepted the meals that were offered. my mother has now
    decided she can no longer eat any of these meals, so i told her we should discontinue
    the program. when i mentioned it to my wife, she became very upset with me, saying
    her father appreciated those meals. i reminded her that her father is able to
    drive himself to the supermarket and buy frozen dinners similar to what is being
    provided through the service. my wife is so angry she now says she will never
    again share any leftovers with my mother. it''s an understatement to say this
    situation has created a major fight between us. is my wife correct in being upset

    successful, handsome and wonderful men throwing themselves at her. a couple of

    my daughter came to me and said she had met someone. i said, "tell me about him."

    as i was to discover she is a lesbian. she is now in a relationship with a wonderful

    were sleeping in our bed" -- even when they weren''t. he even goes to sleep on
    the couch after we have had sex. i don''t like sleeping by myself every night,
    and i have tried to explain how upsetting this is to me. my little girl has even
    asked why daddy sleeps on the couch. any suggestions? -- missing my snuggle, melbourne,

    no one in my family will tell my grandmother the reason they don''t call her is
    she talks too much. none of us is retired like she is, and our evenings are chaotic
    enough without a two-hour conversation with her. relatives ask me to relay messages
    on their behalf so they won''t have to call her. she''s always crying and telling
    me i''m the only one who is "good to her." i''d feel guilty if i had to tell grandma
    the truth -- but i, as well as the rest of the family, have had enough of her

    of money. maddy thinks i''m "controlling" because i get frustrated when we have

    i''m writing regarding the letter from "not fooled in michigan" (april 22), who
    expressed concern about her fiance''s daughter''s reliance on him to proofread
    her college papers. as a teacher, i know when i assign a paper that the spelling
    and grammar will likely be checked by a computer or a person other than a student.
    whether it''s the campus proofreading service or a parent is immaterial. would
    "fooled" have the same "ethical" objections if "kimberly" were using the campus
    office to provide the same service? what matters is the content of her essays,
    which the girl is apparently writing by herself -- and incidentally, completing
    in enough time to send them to a proofreader and await a response. that suggests
    a more developed sense of responsibility than is common among my students. i see
    no ethical dilemma here, and i find it disingenuous of "not fooled" to suggest
    otherwise. as for kimberly''s "unhealthy" reliance on her dad, the aforementioned

    i''m a 40-year-old, stay-at-home mom with a 17-year-old and a 14-year-old. three
    weeks ago, on my birthday, i found out that i am pregnant. forty and pregnant
    --- it is truly a miracle. my husband, who is almost 50, is in complete shock.
    he has looked like a ghost since he found out. i finally had an emotional meltdown
    and told him i don''t feel like he''s very happy for our unexpected bundle. his
    reply? "sorry, hon, i''m not!" he thinks he''s too old. my older child has said
    only one sentence to me since i told her the news: "you''re going to be an old
    mom." they feel i have ruined their lives. i feel ... happy. how do i get them

    i''m 53, work in an office six to eight hours a day, and then come home to cook
    dinner and do household chores. my husband, "todd," is 48. he works eight to 10
    hours a day and expects sex three to four times a week. i''m exhausted and can''t
    do it anymore! my best friend, "mavis," has been a widow for five years. she tells
    me she''s going crazy because she hasn''t had sex in all this time. she asked
    if i''d share todd just one night a week. mavis isn''t pretty, but she has a very

    "traveler" said not a single housekeeper has been "exceptional." what about the
    simple fact that housekeepers clean up his mess during his stay? they take out
    his trash, refresh his towels and replace used soaps and shampoos. housekeepers
    vacuum anything tracked in, remake beds, wipe down the sink and bath/showers.
    i can say from personal experience that many hotel guests wouldn''t leave their
    homes in the condition they leave their hotel rooms, and sadly, they feel that
    it''s acceptable. housekeepers work hard to provide a clean and comfortable room
    prior to a guest''s arrival, and strive to maintain that comfort throughout the
    guest''s stay. in addition, they will fulfill any request within their abilities.

    i met "angie" on a dating site not long ago. she''s an intelligent, open-minded
    woman. so when one of our first conversations turned to sexual preferences, i
    felt at ease revealing one of my "likes" to her even though i didn''t know her
    well. today when we were talking, angie mentioned that she had asked her girlfriend
    about her experiences with what i had discussed. clearly her intent wasn''t to
    gossip, but nevertheless, i felt betrayed. i had discussed a personal part of
    myself in a private conversation, and she had divulged what i had said to someone
    without asking me. now i''m not sure i want to continue talking to her. confidence
    is an essential part of any relationship beyond a casual friendship, and i don''t
    want her friends being privy to everything that goes on between me and her, even
    on a "promise not to tell anyone" basis. on the other hand, angie seemed concerned
    when she realized i was upset, and her intentions were not malicious. should i
    move on? if not, how do i discuss my feelings with angie without being confrontational?

    by a huge margin. then the coach decided she wanted us to be "co-presidents" and

    may i respond to "bound for college" (april 9), the high school senior who is
    distressed because she may have to go to a state university? this is america,
    the land of opportunity, not the land of entitlement. a college education is a
    luxury, not a right. how fortunate she is to have parents who can send her to
    college. it is my hope that her father does get that job at the university. what
    an excellent benefit he will have to get reduced tuition for his offspring. if,
    however, that is not good enough for her, it is her right to refuse that gift.
    then she may go to the school of her choice and pay for it herself. with the cost
    of tuition today, that will be quite an undertaking. there are a number of options:
    student loans, grants, scholarships, a job or an enlistment in the military. as
    you mentioned, abby, in your response, education is what you make of it. my suggestion

    i''m a 19-year-old woman. when i was 4, my mom went to prison for eight years.
    it turned her life around. at 38, she now has a college degree, a loving husband,
    a good job and a new home. my two younger sisters say they don''t want to be part
    of mom''s life, but they never fail to call her at holiday and birthday time to
    pick up the gifts they know she has bought them. afterward, they don''t contact
    her or answer her calls and texts until the next holiday. it leaves mom depressed
    and feeling used. i have tried telling them they''re wrong, but they don''t listen.

    our daughter, "julie," came home for the weekend so we could meet her new boyfriend,
    "scott." he''s a delightful young man, and my daughter is clearly smitten. when
    i suggested scott sleep in the guest room, julie and my wife gave me this perplexed
    look as though i''m from a different planet. in the end, i was deeply disappointed
    that they shared a bedroom. after 30 years of marriage, this created the first
    disagreement between my wife and me in a long time. i''m no prude. my wife and
    i had our share of premarital mambo, but we always slept in separate rooms while
    visiting our families before we were married. it was about respect for our parents''
    feelings. julie spends a lot of time with scott''s family where they share a room.

    up for hours talking about the things we were going through. i have developed
    love for brian that is beyond anything i have felt before, built on a great deal

    there for us. i feel guilty, however, that i have this relationship so soon after

    ptsd and my fear of abandonment. i feel isolated because i''m so much younger
    than most widows i meet. also, because i have the complicating factor of brian''s
    divorce (with two kids) going on now, i''m afraid my anxiety will never decrease.

    i am a marriage counselor writing in response to the march 22 letter from the
    man who objected to his wife having dinner with a mutual (male) friend while the

    excessive, perhaps even a signal he has an "ownership" attitude toward his spouse,
    which is associated with controlling behavior. in the absence of any reason to
    distrust her, why is he so upset? my husband of 20 years was going to japan for
    a week to visit our foster daughter. i was unable to go, so one of my female friends
    went with him instead. my husband is attractive, and no doubt has had many opportunities
    to cheat. i realize many spouses are unfaithful, but you don''t keep them faithful
    by keeping them on a short leash. all that does is make a potential cheater sneakier.
    because spouses who cheat sometimes claim their lovers-in-waiting are "just friends"
    doesn''t mean men and women can''t be "just friends." "illinois" is insecure at

    i am a woman who is in love with my former high school coach. i don''t know if
    i should tell him. i first realized i loved him about a year and a half after
    i met him. we had an extremely close relationship, but it was not inappropriate.
    he is 13 years older than i am. after two years of getting to know him and forming
    a strong friendship, he moved across the country for work. since then, i have
    entered college and we see each other only on holidays and in the summer. every
    time i see him, we go back to our normal, wonderful relationship as though nothing
    has changed. i was in denial about my feelings for him. i told myself it was puppy
    love and couldn''t work out because of the age difference and the distance. but
    after four years of pining for him, and several failed romances with others, i
    realize i deeply love him. we have a unique connection, but he has a reputation
    as a "player," so i can''t be sure he feels the same. i don''t want to ruin what
    we have, but i want more. should i finally reveal my feelings? -- hurting badly

    i am in my mid-50s, divorced for many years, and have two grown children. i began
    seeing a delightful gentleman about three years ago. (i''ll call him jack.) he
    was dating several women at the time, and after a few months, i made it clear
    that we would have to have an exclusive relationship or i could not go on seeing
    him. jack reluctantly agreed and kept his promise. four months ago, i demanded
    a commitment from him. i knew i loved him and wanted to spend the rest of my life
    with him. he told me he loved me, but marriage is out of the question -- and if

    i am a volunteer manager coordinating services between 200 students and tutors
    in an adult refugee english as a second language program. we benefit greatly from
    the skills and perspectives of young people, but the job requires volunteers to
    be self-directed and mature enough to handle the assignment. may i offer some
    advice to those who wish to volunteer for any program for class credit -- as an
    intern or during summer vacation? understand that your assignment is a job. someone
    is counting on you to be reliable and do it well -- even though you''re not being
    paid. if you want to volunteer, call me yourself. our conversation will be, for
    all intents and purposes, a job interview. i do not want to talk to your mother
    unless she''s the one looking for the assignment. nonprofit organizations offer
    volunteers work experience and insight into a life that is unfamiliar to you.
    if you''re not ready to commit to an assignment, ask the manager if you can "shadow"
    someone who is currently volunteering. it''s a great way to see if the work interests
    you. my volunteers are the most dedicated, intrepid, compassionate people i have
    ever met. they succeed because they''re enthusiastic and sincere in their desire
    to contribute. they range in age from 17 to 82, but they all have one thing in
    common: they picked up the phone and spent time doing their own research. volunteering
    is an excellent way to make a difference in the world, especially when you understand
    where you fit into that world. -- volunteer manager in denver'

    my fraternal twin, "marla," was always difficult. when we were kids she was physically
    and emotionally abusive. she stopped hitting me only after i outgrew her in high
    school, but she continues to try to control me. when i started dating my wife,
    "gloria," marla would tell me gloria wasn''t good enough for me. at first, it
    gave me serious doubts about the woman who is the love of my life. we''re now
    expecting our first child -- a daughter -- and marla has been offering parenting
    advice that goes against what gloria and i feel about child-rearing. when i politely
    decline her advice, marla accuses me of being "selfish" for not appreciating it.
    a parenting book was delivered anonymously to our home. it took me a few days
    to remember that marla had mentioned it. five days later she sent me an angry
    email because i hadn''t thanked her for it. spats like this usually result in

    i have been dealing with an anxiety disorder i thought i had beaten. i hadn''t
    had an attack in years, until i found myself having one recently at the gym. i
    ran to the dressing room in tears to battle it out, and was practicing breathing
    deeply when i spotted something shiny in the far corner of the room. i immediately
    flashed on the "pennies from heaven" letters i have read in your column and, still
    crying, went to see what it was. as soon as i saw it was a penny, i felt calmer.
    abby, i haven''t lost anyone close who might have sent me a penny, but when i
    picked it up it had the year of my birth on it. i understood then it was intended
    for me, and my anxiety dissipated. i''m confused, though. is this something our
    guardian angels share amongst themselves, or did an unknown angel take pity on
    me? -- jennifer in ontario, canada'

    i have a huge problem. i am 13, and my mom makes me buy clothes a size larger
    than what i need or want. i wear a size 0 pant and my closet is filled with 2''s.
    mom likes her clothing loose, but i don''t like mine to fit that way. she claims
    she buys my clothes big so i can "grow into them." but how much am i going to
    grow at this age? i don''t like the way these clothes fit, and it seems like a
    waste of money because i like expensive things. mom bought me tops a year ago
    that are just beginning to fit me now. she doesn''t like shopping very much, and

    easter is coming. many families still purchase live rabbits as pets for their
    children. parents often think rabbits are good "starter" pets and don''t understand
    what they are getting into. as a result, many of these poor creatures end up in
    animal shelters, and children learn that pets are disposable. before getting rabbits,
    people should consider: 1. are they willing to make a seven-to-10-year commitment?
    that is the average lifespan of a rabbit. 2. what will happen if their child gets
    bored with the bunny after six months? 3. is there a place in their house for
    a rabbit cage? 4. are they willing to pay to get it spayed/neutered and provide
    vet care? 5. do they know that most rabbits hate to be held? will their child
    accept that? 6. are they willing to ensure that children under 7 won''t pick up
    the rabbit without supervision? rabbits are fragile; their legs or spine will
    break if accidentally dropped. 7. can they provide three hours of exercise every
    day in an escape-proof area outside its cage? 8. do the adults want the rabbit,
    too? a rabbit should be a family pet. if people have questions about rabbits and
    their care, please ask them to contact my organization. we are happy to answer
    questions. our website is www.rabbitnetwork.org, and our phone number is (781)

    my unmarried sister passed away unexpectedly two years ago. my brother, other
    sister and i had a difficult time locating her personal accounts and bills because
    she did everything online. this prompted me to begin writing down all my passwords
    for my computer and storing the list in a secure location. i have asked my husband
    of 29 years to do the same, but he refuses. my husband has given me the information
    on our joint financial accounts, but insists that his email account is private.
    i told him he doesn''t have to give me the password. i just want him to write
    it down in the event something happens. i told him i have nothing to hide, but
    does he? he got angry, and we are barely speaking now. five years ago, i found
    out he was trading questionable emails with a divorced cocktail waitress, and
    now i''m concerned. he frequents bars after work, and i can''t help but worry.
    should i drop it or ask him what he''s hiding? -- nothing to hide in ohio'

    my mother was recently invited to a shower and was given specific instructions
    not to put her name on the gift. the reason? the honoree plans to issue one general
    thank-you to everyone because she "doesn''t have the time" to send individual
    thank-you notes. abby, if someone takes the time and spends the money to buy a
    gift, shouldn''t the recipient be gracious enough to write a personal note? --

    i would like to respond to "agnostic dad in south carolina" (feb. 16), who wondered
    about how to answer the inevitable "is there a god?" question his children will
    ask. my parents had strong but differing christian faiths. they compromised when
    bringing us up, and we went to the church nearest our home (another denomination).
    further, when we were teens, they allowed us to "sample" other religious traditions
    to determine what would suit us best. i became agnostic, and like "dad in s.c.,"
    was unsure what to tell my son. my husband and i do not belong to any organized
    religion and didn''t take him to church as a youngster. instead, we introduced
    stories from the bible at bedtime, and allowed him to attend his friends'' churches
    when he asked to. more important, we showed him that all people are to be valued
    and that differences are to be respected. our son is now in his late 20s. he''s
    a gentle, caring person with an interest in people from other cultures, religions
    and circumstances. whether he is agnostic, religious or an atheist is a personal
    matter to him. he''s comfortable with his beliefs and doesn''t impose them on
    anyone else. as a parent, i couldn''t ask for more. -- free-thinking mom in washington'

    for years i have wondered about this every time i have gone to a funeral and have
    ridden in the procession to the cemetery. as the procession travels to the cemetery,
    all cars and trucks pull over and stop. that custom strikes me as very touching.
    i was in another procession last week, and even the ups truck and several semis
    pulled over. my question is, is this a custom only in southern indiana where i
    live, or does everyone do this? -- wondering near indianapolis'

    i divorced two years ago after 25 years of marriage. during the divorce i met
    a man who helped me through the emotional roller coaster i was on. we became close
    and hoped to be married eventually. he died unexpectedly of a heart attack. my
    mother introduced me to another man, "donald," who is good and kind, but who was
    "burned" after a divorce and a long relationship. we see each other once a week,
    but i''d like to see him more often. i''m having trouble being in limbo and not
    becoming too attached to donald. conventional wisdom tells me to stop waiting
    for him to come around. i work, volunteer, and have been asked out by other men.
    i have turned them down so as not to jeopardize what i currently have. donald
    isn''t seeing anyone else. can you please help set me straight once and for all?
    i''m in my late 40s and feeling blue about my dating situation. -- uncertain in

    i am currently deployed in afghanistan. my best friend''s little sister, "brittany,"
    has had a crush on me for years. she has been straightforward about what she wants
    -- marriage, kids, white picket fence, etc. she has always been like a little
    sister, so it has been awkward. i thought it was weird for a 15-year-old (at the
    time) to say that to an older soldier on r&r.; during my deployment brittany has
    sent me care packages loaded with cookies. maybe i should have kept my mouth shut
    about my weakness for homemade cookies, but hindsight is 20/20. brittany has now
    called in the bribe by inviting me to her senior prom. not wanting to mess with
    the steady supply of baked goods, i said yes. i figure it''s an appropriate way
    to say thanks for the cookies. i intend to make sure brittany enjoys her prom
    with her medal-covered arm candy, but i need to let her know that while i''m flattered
    she thinks so highly of me, i''m not interested in dating her. i love her like
    a sister. i don''t want to break her heart. any suggestions for a guy who''s about
    as subtle as a tank rolling down a cobblestone road on a sunday? -- medal-covered
