    you printed a letter from "k," a woman who has been dating a wonderful man for
    18 months. she loves him with all her heart, but thought she would rather be his
    friend than permanent partner. you advised her to break things off, so that both
    of them may be free to find "true love." abby, that helps perpetuate one of the
    saddest lies of human existence. "chemistry" and "magic" -- as you call them --
    have almost nothing to do with love. passion and lust, as such, are illusions
    that hold empty promises and fade quickly. why do you think there are so many
    more failed and broken relationships than happy, lifelong ones? because people
    believe these lies are indicators of love, and search again and again for them
    when they fail to fulfill. love is eternal and ever-present. love is also more
    closely related to friendship than passion. if you polled successful marriages,
    you would find that the most committed partners claim they were best friends first.
    passion is certainly exciting and part of the shared experience between partners,
    but true intimacy grows from trust and friendship -- not from the fear that lustful
    illusions bring. at one time, my wife was like "k." it took seven long years for
    my patient love to find its way into her heart, but we''ve been happily and passionately
    married ever since! true love never walks away from another. i hope "k''s" boyfriend
    hangs in there and shows her what love is really all about. -- bruce culp, vero

    i just want to thank you for your suggestions about christmas gifts for seniors.
    my 15-year-old daughter took your advice and made beautiful "family albums" for
    each of her grandmothers. around thanksgiving of last year, she wrote letters
    to all their brothers, sisters, children and grandchildren, explaining what she
    was planning and saying she''d like a memory or a story involving them. she also
    asked if they had any photographs she could use or copy. the replies were great!
    almost everyone took the time to send an old memory or a funny story. those who
    didn''t regretted it once they saw the books. my mother and mother-in-law both
    cried when they read their albums. it was something special just to watch their
    faces and hear all the "oh, yeahs," and, "i forgot about thats." both albums are
    proudly displayed in their homes and are passed around often. i''m very proud
    of my daughter for all her hard work on those books. she did a great job. my question
    for you, abby, is: how does she top that this year? -- tia''s proud mom, bethlehem,

    the letter from "still crying in fairmont," whose fiance, "mike," rejected her
    after she had spent a year caring for his sick mother, really hit home with me.
    i was asked to come to colorado from the northwest to help a man who had some
    development property. "cary''s" affairs were in a mess. he hired me, and i tried
    to straighten everything out. he promised to pay me after everything was taken
    care of. like mike, cary pledged eternal fidelity and promised we''d have a wonderful
    life together. i worked long hours every day for six years for him. cary received
    some death threats, and i even risked my life for him. i protected him because
    i believed him. i spent 18 months in prison because i refused to testify against
    him. guess what? when i was released, i came home and found he was living with
    another woman! he told me he had never cared about me, and has since tried to
    make me look like the bad guy. i have cried a bucket of tears and am ashamed for
    having been taken in. my life has been torn apart, and i ended up with post-traumatic
    stress syndrome. i finally realized that cary has done this to people all his
    life. well, enough was enough! i sued him for what he owes me. no judgment has
    been rendered, but i do have a trial date. abby, men like mike and cary are the

    during the holiday season, you often publish letters from older persons complaining
    about being alone or left out. last winter, my husband and i entertained six sets
    of overnight guests at our florida home. most of them were over 65. based upon
    our experience, here is a questionnaire for the person who hasn''t received another
    invitation: (1) when you arrived, did you greet the host and hostess warmly --
    or did you complain about the airline, the stairs, the driveway, the distance,
    the traffic and the crowds? (2) if you have special dietary requirements, did
    you inform your hosts well in advance, or did you wait until the meal was on the
    table? did you expect everyone to eat only your special diet? (3) did you talk
    about anything other than your medical problems? did you show an interest in others
    and ask questions about their lives? (4) did you complain that the bed was too
    hard or too soft, and if the pillow was not to your liking, did you feel compelled
    to say so? (5) did you claim the best chair in the house as yours for the entire
    visit? did you complain about the weather? did you adjust the thermostat to your
    comfort level without first asking your hosts? (6) if you are early to bed and
    early to rise, did you expect the entire household to conform to your schedule?
    (7) did you state your opinion and give advice on every topic? or did you consider
    the fact that others may know something, too? (8) did you express gratitude for
    the efforts your hosts made on your behalf? abby, our reason for inviting guests
    is to enjoy their company. what causes some people to think they no longer need
    to practice good manners simply because they are older? -- inviting fewer people

    this is in response to "hurt mom in washington," who was both angry and sad at

    "her way" without any "interference" on my part. to make a long story short, several
    weeks before her wedding her caterer informed her that due to a scheduling misunderstanding,
    he would be unable to cater her wedding after all. after frantically contacting
    many other caterers without success, guess who she asked to cater the wedding?

    plans to go awry, she needs to know that these things usually have a way of working

    when i saw the letter from "forgotten daughter," whose family is in turmoil due
    to her dad''s infidelities, i had to respond. call this letter a plea to parents
    who are contemplating having affairs. when i was 13, my dad started having an
    affair with a younger woman and left my mom. my reaction to the situation was
    to cut school, shoplift and drink. this apparently isn''t unusual, if you pay
    attention to the statistics or watch talk shows. the reality was that dad did
    not have an affair on my mom. he cheated on the whole family. many cheating spouses
    say, "this is between my spouse and me, and it has nothing to do with the children."
    the truth is, it has everything to do with the children. men or women who are
    considering having an affair need to stop and think beyond their own selfish needs,
    and consider the havoc it will wreak on the lives of their children. the message
    they''re sending to their kids is, "this affair, which is based on sex, means
    more to me than creating a safe and loving environment for you." children aren''t
    equipped with the coping skills necessary to come through an affair unscathed.
    (neither are many adults, for that matter.) if your marriage is unsatisfactory,
    seek counseling with your spouse. if divorce is inevitable, seek family counseling
    to help your kids through the transition. but please, for heaven''s sake, wait
    until the divorce papers are signed before beginning another relationship. your
    children deserve that courtesy. their very lives may depend upon it. what was
    the outcome in our family? dad moved back in with us two years later, with no
    explanation to the kids. i was in therapy for several years, trying to learn to
    trust men and to love again. my mother lost huge chunks of her self-esteem that
    she is just now retrieving, after 20 years. and my brother committed suicide.
    i hope it was worth it, dad. -- a survivor in california'

    as a longtime member of our local traffic safety commission and past volunteer
    aarp 55-alive driving instructor, i wish to comment on the recent letter from
    tom lynch of cedar rapids, iowa. mr. lynch suggested that the use of cell phones
    is safe because truck drivers have used cb radios for many years. what he failed
    to add is that accidents involving trucks have increased dramatically in recent
    years. part of the reason is the increased number of trucks on the road -- but
    how many others are due to inattentive driving because the driver was on the radio
    or otherwise occupied? he also suggested that you will next advocate passing laws
    against tuning the radio while driving, looking at your passenger and conversing
    while driving, adjusting the temperature while driving or driving without adequate
    sleep. while i don''t advocate laws preventing those activities, if drivers could
    be convinced to refrain from those practices, we would have much safer highways.
    driving is a full-time responsibility. inattentive driving is the cause of more
    motor vehicle accidents than any other single activity, although it''s not always
    listed on accident reports as such, because it''s too difficult to prove in a
    court of law. thanks for your support of highway and driver safety, abby. -- james

    i have been retired from teaching for many years, and would like to share a lesson
    i learned that stands out in my memory like no other. i was young and teaching
    math at the junior high school level. we had worked hard on a new concept all
    week, and the students were very stressed. they were frowning, frustrated and
    carping at each other and me. wanting to stop the crankiness before it got out
    of hand, i asked the students in the room to take out two sheets of paper and
    list the names of the other students in the room, leaving a space between each
    name. then i told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each
    of their classmates and write it down. it took the remainder of the class period
    to finish the assignment. when the students handed me the papers and left, they
    seemed more relaxed. that weekend, i wrote the name of each student on a separate
    sheet of paper and listed what the students had said about that individual. on
    monday, i gave each student his or her list. before long, everyone was smiling.
    "really?" i heard one whisper. "i never knew that meant anything to anyone." "i
    didn''t know anyone liked me that much!" the assignment was never mentioned again,
    but it didn''t matter, because the exercise had accomplished its purpose. the
    students felt better about themselves and each other. years later, i was asked
    to attend the funeral of one of those students, a promising young man even when
    i taught him in junior high school. i was deeply saddened by his untimely death
    in vietnam. the church was packed with "mark''s" friends, many of whom had been
    his classmates and students of mine. after the funeral, i and many of mark''s
    former classmates were invited to his parents'' house. they approached me and
    said, "we want to show you something. mark was carrying this when he was killed."
    his father pulled something from a wallet. it was the list of all the good things
    mark''s classmates had said about him. "thank you so much for doing that," mark''s
    mother said. "as you can see, mark treasured it." a group of mark''s classmates

    i can''t decide what to do. i am a 44-year-old man. in 1996, my wife left me after
    19 years of marriage. i have one daughter who stayed with me during the separation.
    during the first year of our split, i tried very hard to persuade my wife to return
    home, even though i knew she was having an affair with a married man. in 1997,
    i finally gave up on wooing her back and started seriously dating a wonderful
    younger woman. soon we were madly in love. all my friends and my daughter fell
    in love with my new love. my wife, waiting our divorce, saw what was happening
    and decided she wanted to come back home. after trying so hard for so long and
    for my daughter''s sake, i decided to take my wife back and try again. it has
    been very difficult. we''ve been seeing a marriage counselor, but we fight all
    the time. every time there''s an argument i think of my lost love. we never fought.
    my wife is very strong-willed and extremely jealous of every woman who speaks
    to me, although i never cheated on her. my girlfriend was heartbroken when i broke
    it off, but she has stayed out of my life for the last six months because she
    doesn''t want to be a home-wrecker. she now knows things aren''t going well at
    home. i have called her a couple of times. she has made it clear she wants me
    back, but only after the marriage is over. i am ready to give up again on my wife.
    she knows i am not happy, and blames me for not trying hard enough. my wife hasn''t
    slept in our bed for two weeks. my friends see the stress and tell me i should
    go with my heart. i''m torn about what to do. can you help me decide what would
    be best for everyone involved? -- mixed-up in missouri'

    why are some people offended when you ask them their age? this question has been
    puzzling me for years. i am 66. i know it is none of my business how old someone
    is, and that there are some legal restrictions about asking, but when i meet someone
    new, i''m tired of asking where they work, live, or if they are married. perhaps
    your readers can tell me why some people are so sensitive about the age issue.

    was terminally ill with cancer. my son-in-law was always there during the night
    when i needed him. we get along well. he takes care of repairs and i have a free

    thankful for what i have. i have my health, my own home, and i''m still able to
    handle important things. every time i see her coming into the yard i feel like

    please help me and others who are constantly asked to give donations. i am a university
    professor at retirement age; i have a modest salary. fortunately, i am frugal
    and thus able to lead a comfortable life. i contribute to numerous causes. helping
    my fellow human beings is a moral duty from which i derive great satisfaction.
    yes, i realize there are catastrophes in this world, and i do add something to
    my contribution whenever i can. however, i am unable to do it all the time. every
    year, i send checks to more than 80 charities, and i make it a point to label
    each donation "annual contribution for the year" -- to no avail. still i continue
    to receive three to four daily requests and/or "gifts." besides the inconvenience
    of all this unasked-for and unwanted mail, i''m concerned about the waste of paper
    and the money that should go to philanthropy and not marketing. how can i convince
    charities to accept the fact that i can send them only one check a year? could
    you suggest that these associations label us "once-a-year contributors" and stop
    showering us with requests and gifts the rest of the year? believe me, abby, i

    after five years of marriage, i find myself in the middle of divorce proceedings.
    i''ll spare you the gory details, but suffice it to say that my wife left me for
    a co-worker. luckily there are no children involved, so other than the emotional
    pain, the process is primarily financial at this point. as part of the proposed
    settlement, i am responsible for returning the personal effects she left behind
    when she abandoned our home. most items are easy to deal with, such as clothing,
    shoes, etc. however, other things are causing a dilemma for me. these are the
    items that have a connection with our marriage. in particular, i''m troubled by
    what to do with our wedding album. in one sense it represents a part of my life
    and my family history, even though it''s been painful. on the other hand, the
    album is a reminder of the failure of our marriage and the promises that we made
    to each other. its financial value is virtually nil, and she has not explicitly
    requested its return. i want to do the right thing, but not at the expense of

  subject: Thieves Find Lots of Merriment During Bustling Holiday Season
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    may i offer some words of advice for those who make it easy pickings for burglars?
    stealing during the holidays is like taking candy from a baby. most homes display
    lovely gift packages under christmas trees. if no precautions are taken, homes
    become a "marketplace" from which thieves can "shop" with impunity. it is also
    a time when stores are teeming with careless, unsuspecting shoppers who are stressed
    out looking for last-minute gifts, and rushing around trying to get everything
    done. pickpockets and muggers delight in how easy it is to rob shoppers during
    the holiday season. abby, i would like to provide your readers with some tips
    to help them avoid becoming victims this holiday season: -- thieves hate bright
    lights, so install outside lights and keep them on at night. if you plan to be
    away, purchase timers for your indoor lights and set them to make it appear that
    someone is at home. (lights left on 24 hours a day are a dead giveaway that the
    house is empty.) -- be sure to have your mail and newspaper delivery halted until
    you return. if it piles up, it''s a sure sign that you''re not there. -- leave
    curtains, shades and blinds in the normal position. -- be certain door and window
    locks are in working order -- and use them. -- do not leave blinds or curtains
    open so that one peek in the window reveals piles of gifts under the tree -- or
    elsewhere. allowing thieves to see the gifts is like extending an invitation.
    -- going out for the evening? turn on some lights, as well as your radio or television.
    it will make your dwelling appear to be occupied. -- beware of couriers delivering
    packages. criminals sometimes use that ruse to get a look inside, or if you appear
    to be alone, to force their way in. thieves also pose as agents seeking charitable
    donations. always ask for identification, ask to see permits, and also ask how
    the funds will be used. -- when shopping, be alert and aware of what''s going
    on around you. -- park in a lighted garage or lot, and be sure your path to the
    store is well-lighted. familiarize yourself with your parking location so you
    needn''t wander around looking for your car when you return. be sure to place
    all packages in the trunk of your car and lock your car. -- avoid carrying large
    amounts of cash. pay by credit card or check. to deter pickpockets and purse snatchers,
    don''t overburden yourself with packages. carry your purse close to your body,
    securely closed and not dangling by the straps. men, carry your wallet in an inside
    pocket or in your front pants pocket. -- teach your children to go to a store
    clerk or security guard if they become separated from you. and if you feel unsafe,
    do not hesitate to ask a security guard to escort you to your car. -- a final
    warning: be sure your valuables are inventoried and marked. that way, if thieves
    succeed in robbing you, you have proof of loss and will be able to identify and
    claim your stolen items should they be recovered. happy, safe holidays to you
    and your readers, abby. -- "officer krupke," new york city'

    why is it that after a couple has dated for more than two years, everyone assumes

    for three years. while we are very happy, we feel we still need time before moving

    twenty years ago, my high school civics teacher gave us a choice for a project:
    write a research paper or perform 20 hours of volunteer work and report on the
    experience. for not completely altruistic reasons, i chose the volunteer experience
    because i thought it sounded more interesting -- not to mention easier! that was
    one of the most memorable high school experiences i had. i didn''t come from a
    perfect background (does anyone?), but it was good for me as an impressionable
    young person to see how those in true need lived. i will never forget rocking
    a baby who was born without eyes because his mother dallied with drugs during
    her pregnancy. most volunteer experiences aren''t as sobering, but there is always
    something to learn. as a result of that school project, i have led a life of volunteering
    -- even if it is just an hour a week. in addition, i have introduced my children
    to the wonderful world of volunteering as young as age 3, and they love it. my
    parents were also volunteers. abby, please address the subject of volunteering
    with your readers. if they don''t volunteer, they owe it to themselves to give
    it a try. it''s a wonderful experience. just when they think they will only be
    giving, lo and behold, they''ll be receiving an education and a worthwhile experience.

    you have probably heard everything, but here goes. my sister-in-law died last
    summer. she had been very ill for a year. my brother-in-law, "tom," took excellent
    care of her, but not too long before her death, she had to be put in a nursing
    home. while visiting his wife there, tom struck up a friendship with a woman i''ll
    call "dolly." tom is in his 70s. dolly is in her 80s. dolly''s husband died about
    the same time as my sister-in-law. get this: while tom and his family were receiving
    friends at the funeral home, dolly showed up and announced to one and all that
    she was tom''s girlfriend. to make matters worse, at the funeral, she also told
    everyone at church she was tom''s girlfriend. she even sat with us in the family
    pews, right behind tom. how could anyone be so brazen as to not even wait until
    the spouse is buried to announce their affair? one week later, tom bought her
    an engagement ring. two weeks after that, they eloped. do you think we should
    exclude them from our annual holiday dinner? several family members have said
    they will not attend if she''s there. our family has always been very close, but

    there is a row of trees and bushes along the fence that separates my neighbor''s

    unfortunately, that neighbor moved away and another family lives next door. the
    branches now hang over my roof -- dropping berries and leaves that cause stains

    several years of waiting -- and listening to their excuses -- i trimmed the trees
    and bushes back myself and deposited the trimmings on the neighbors'' side of

    it would have been "more neighborly" had i disposed of the trimmings myself. the

    i am a 45-year-old single woman. my significant other and i have been together
    for five years. he''s eight years older than i am, and he brings me great joy.
    a problem has arisen that has me at my wit''s end. when we first began dating,
    "george" would drop hints about how he loved long blond hair. at the time i was
    a natural brunette, but thought a few highlights wouldn''t hurt. i let it grow.
    eventually my hair became lighter and lighter until i was all blond. however,
    i never really liked it. it didn''t complement my skin tones. i have been blond
    for more than four years. friends and family tell me i look better as a brunette.
    during my last trip to the hairdresser, i asked to have my hair darkened one shade.
    it''s now very light brown, and i like it. george hates it. he hates it so much
    that for the first week he wouldn''t look at me or talk to me. i had no idea what
    was wrong, and i suspected he had met someone else. the following week, we were
    talking again, but things still weren''t "right." all signs of affection were
    gone. i tolerated it for a week and then confronted him. it turned out he really
    wanted me blond. i let him know how unattractive he was making me feel and how
    shallow i thought he was. he blamed me and my hair and said that if i hadn''t
    gone blond, we probably never would have gotten together. i tried to convince
    him i was still the same person. the fight escalated to the point where i packed
    my bags and was out the door. he finally admitted he had the problem, and convinced
    me to stay while he worked it out. the following week he was back to being his
    old self. last night my family gathered at a nice restaurant for a birthday dinner.
    midway through the evening, wouldn''t you know, in walked a couple, and the blond-headed
    woman sat next to our table "flipping" her hair. george couldn''t take his eyes
    off her. it was so embarrassing it made me depressed. i gave george "the look"
    to knock it off, but he didn''t. my family also noticed. when we got home, he
    acted like nothing was wrong. i don''t know what to do. i can''t go back to being
    blond because i''ll never know if he loves me or the fantasy. it seems like such
    a trivial reason to break up, but i can''t imagine putting up with this for the
    rest of my life. any advice? -- tired of the roots in pennsylvania'

    my husband and i were thrilled when his 80-year-old parents decided to transfer
    ownership of their rustic family cabin to us. we have made many repairs and are
    responsible for its upkeep. we love it, and because we are teachers, we have the
    entire summer to enjoy it. the problem is, my in-laws expect me to be the "perfect
    hostess" when they visit -- even if they don''t let us know in advance they are
    coming. i am an excellent cook, but my mother-in-law expects me to serve full
    meals -- meat, vegetable, salad, rolls and dessert. in addition, she expects me
    to put out butter knives, salad plates and linen napkins. she seems obsessed with
    the table setting and makes nasty remarks if i don''t set the table to suit her.
    (she doesn''t utter a peep when her daughter omits the butter knives and extra
    plates!) the unannounced visits and fixation with meals have seriously damaged
    my relationship with my in-laws. this is not something i can discuss with them,
    because they are both elderly and set in their ways. i should add that the cottage
    has no dishwasher, so everything must be washed by hand in lake water, which we
    pump in. abby, i don''t think formality should be the rule in a casual summer
    cottage. sometimes a sandwich on a paper plate on the deck is just the ticket.
    i don''t want to be a slave to the kitchen. i have serious projects to work on
    and have only the summer to accomplish them. my husband supports me in this, but
    he knows his parents are too old to change. even if we tried discussing it with
    them, my mother-in-law is hard of hearing, and they both seem to have memory problems.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have been stuck at home on worker''s comp for a year, but will be returning
    to my job in a few days. unfortunately, a rumor has gone around at work that my
    fiance (who is also employed there) is having an affair with one of our co-workers.
    this woman visits our home regularly and has been a friend to both of us. the
    rumor stems from the fact that people at work see my fiance and her joking and
    playing around, and assume they have something going on -- especially since i''m
    not there. abby, i know that nothing is going on between them. my fiance is devoted
    to me, and we have a perfect, loving relationship. my question: what, if anything,
    should i do about this rumor? when i''m back on the scene, i''m afraid it''s going
    to make our working environment uncomfortable for all three of us. i want these
    people to know that the rumor is not true, and they should mind their own business.

    my fiance and i are being married next summer. we have asked my niece and nephew,
    who will both be teen-agers, to be in the wedding. they were delighted. the problem
    is that they live out of town with their mother, "rosie." their father (my brother)
    lives in the same city. in the past when my parents wanted to see the children,
    transportation would have to be provided to get them here. rosie didn''t want
    the children to fly, so mom and dad had to drive both ways. my brother helped
    with transportation when he could, but it was mostly up to my parents to provide
    it. my fiance doesn''t want rosie at the wedding. i have no strong feelings one

    may i respond to "happy grandmother, dallas," the grandma of an adopted baby girl,

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'dear readers: since advice is my business, and the season for gift-giving
    is upon us, i offer these suggestions to help avoid financial stress and holiday
    burnout: -- because the internet makes shopping easy, there is a danger of losing
    track of holiday expenses. take control by making a gift list with how much you
    can afford to spend on each, and stay as close to the list as possible. -- consider
    giving "family gifts" instead of individual gifts, especially to those who are
    not immediate family. it could save time and trouble, not to mention a bundle.
    announce that you think it is time to scale back a bit -- and you''ll probably
    hear many sighs of relief. -- give home-baked goodies or gift baskets you create
    to neighbors and co-workers with whom you traditionally exchange gifts. encourage
    them to do the same. remember, it''s the thought that counts, so put on your thinking
    cap. -- be a smart shopper and compare prices. items may be offered for a cheaper
    price at a store you don''t usually frequent. compare internet pricing with catalogs
    and local retail store ads. the price advantage may warrant the extra time and
    trouble to shop locally. -- shop early. don''t wait until the last minute when
    you''re desperate and willing to overpay just to have a gift. if possible, shop
    on monday, tuesday or wednesday during nonpeak hours, such as mornings or late
    afternoons. shop the internet a few weeks in advance of the holidays to avoid
    paying "rush shipping" charges and to guarantee that the items are in stock and
    your packages won''t get bogged down in the holiday shipping overloads. -- shop
    carefully when using credit cards. for some, using plastic doesn''t seem like
    spending "real money," so the totals can get out of hand. write down everything
    you charge to more easily keep spending in check, and check the bills when they
    arrive. it''s easy to be seduced by the idea that you don''t have to pay "until
    next march." ask yourself, if i can''t afford it now, will i be able to afford
    it in march? (the answer is probably "no.") -- if you shop online, use a secure
    browser, order only from companies with which you are familiar, and print out
    copies of all purchase orders and confirmation numbers. this is invaluable if
    you have to dispute an order. -- once you have purchased a gift for everyone on
    your list, stop shopping. with stores and ads so festive, it''s tempting to buy
    extra gifts. if you don''t go shopping, you won''t have to exercise your "won''t
    power." everyone will be happier without an overabundance of gifts that only feed
    the "greed gene." trust me. happy holidays, one and all. -- love, abby'

    since today is thanksgiving, take just a moment to reflect upon all of the things
    for which you are thankful. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve
    lived this long. a lot of people haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands -- maybe
    millions -- are hurting even more. (have you ever visited a veterans hospital?
    a rehabilitation clinic for crippled children?) if you awakened this morning able
    to hear the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the
    breakfast table on two good legs, and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise
    the lord! a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most
    of the world is a lot poorer. no pensions, no welfare. no food stamps, no social
    security. in fact, one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry
    tonight. are you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls
    you, pick up the phone and call someone. are you concerned about our country''s
    future? hooray! our system has been saved by such concern. our country may not
    be a rose garden, but neither is it a patch of weeds. freedom rings! look and
    listen. you can worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret ballot, and
    you can even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head or
    a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different system,
    you are free to go. there are no walls or fences -- nothing to keep you here.
    a final thought: want an instant high? the surest cure for the holiday blues is
    doing something nice for someone. why not call a person who lives alone and invite
    him or her to share dinner? better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you,
    and i''ll see that you get home." (some older people don''t drive, and those who
    do may not like to be behind the wheel after dark.) try it. and let me know the
    results. p.s. special greetings to those of you in the military who wrote from
    remote corners of the world to tell me that you are using my prayer on this thanksgiving
    day. happy thanksgiving, everyone! -- love, abby'

    as a child, i adored my grandparents. i couldn''t wait until sundays when we would
    go to their house and spend all day with them. my grandparents have now passed
    on, and i have my own children. i now live in a different state and many miles
    from my family. when we visit my parents, i leave their home with the feeling
    they felt our time with them was "bothersome." my parents wave my kids outside
    when they would rather stay inside where their grandparents are. they make comments
    about my children''s behavior, such as "too excited" or "they''re hyperactive."
    my children are not hyper. they are excited to see family members they haven''t
    seen all year. i thought having grandchildren was something special. instead,
    after they spend a mere two hours with us, i get the impression my parents have
    had enough. they are not old. they are only in their mid-60s. i am tired of traveling
    halfway across the united states to visit my family and leaving for home feeling
    we outstayed our welcome. we stay in a hotel and rent our own car. we are doing
    all we can to make our visits easy for everyone. i am angry and hope this is published
    in their local newspaper for them to see. what has happened to grandparents today?
    at one time, grandchildren were a treasure. it breaks my heart. -- disappointed
    daughter, hopedale, mass.'

    i would like to share a sweet and unusual experience i had with a stranger while
    christmas shopping last year. the cashier totaled my merchandise and said it came
    to $28.60. i handed her my credit card, but it didn''t register in the machine.
    i gave her another card. it, too, didn''t work. the cashier said something must
    be wrong with the machine. a lady standing behind me asked the cashier, "how much
    was that?" the cashier told her and the lady said, "i''ll take care of it," and
    handed her $30. i was astounded! i said, "lady, don''t do that. i''m able to pay
    for this." she said, "i''m sure you are, but i want to give it to you as a christmas
    present." the cashier handed her the change and the sales slip, which she gave
    to me in case i needed to return the merchandise. i was so stunned i didn''t get
    her name or address. i want to tell her how much the gift was appreciated by both
    me and my wife. -- thankful texan'

    the spouse and, of course, the child/children. however, the value of what i receive

    my fiance and i devised a wedding plan that pleased both our families. he is the
    youngest child; i am an only child. we''ve always been especially close to each
    of our moms. we wanted to make their wedding dreams for us come true, as well
    as our own. the solution? we had three celebrations! one for us, and one for each
    mom. sound crazy? it''s not. my fiance and i eloped to santa fe, n.m., for a private
    ceremony with only my best friend and my fiance''s brother in attendance. we hired
    a professional photographer to capture every moment for our families. it was a
    beautiful ceremony in a church with a minister. three months later, my mom arranged
    a 200-person sit-down wedding reception in my hometown. she asked our long-time
    presbyterian minister to "bless" our marriage with a small ceremony, invited the
    guests, ordered the food and hired the band. in short, she gave the party she
    had always dreamed of for her only child. three months after that, my mother-in-law
    hosted a catholic validation at a church in my husband''s hometown. she was overjoyed
    to provide the mass and party she had always hoped for her son. all in all, we
    had three weddings, and celebrated our marriage for a year. it was perfect. both
    sets of parents attended each other''s events, and everyone got to eat, drink
    and invite whomever they wanted. i didn''t get stressed-out like some brides do
    -- i just enjoyed myself. abby, i highly recommend this solution to anyone who

    to those who wonder, "can people fall back in love after having an affair?" the
    answer is yes. here''s what happened to me: six years ago, my wife found out that
    i had been having an affair with a woman at work for more than three years. her
    husband called my wife and told her all the details. it happened five days before
    christmas, and i had to call both our families to explain why we would not be
    attending the holiday gatherings. i also had to explain to our teen-age daughter
    why i was moving out of our home. we are a very close family, and when i faced
    the ugliness of what i had done and the hurt i caused, i realized what a fool
    i''d been. after convincing my wife that i would do absolutely anything to stay
    married to her, she allowed me to move back home and seemed willing to give it
    a try. we worked with a wonderful counselor who helped us to rediscover each other,
    and we fell in love all over again -- 25 years after we''d done it the first time.
    we also became best friends, and truly have a dream marriage now. abby, i will
    always feel guilt and sadness about what i did. however, love and forgiveness
    gave us a way to begin again. -- blessed in alabama'

  body: 'dear readers: an estimated 80 percent of the population of western nations
    will experience at least one episode of severe back pain. of course, any individual
    who suffers from severe back pain should consult a doctor. most patients are prescribed
    muscle relaxants, pain killers and/or sessions with a physical therapist, and
    given instructions for exercises to be performed at home. does this mean the patient
    emerges pain-free? not necessarily. for many people, the back pain persists to
    a greater or lesser degree for years. a new book, "7 steps to a pain-free life,"
    written by robin mckenzie with craig kubey (published by dutton), is now available
    in bookstores. mr. mckenzie is an honored and respected physical therapist from
    new zealand, and more than 20,000 health professionals worldwide have been trained
    in his methods. most important, patients who have learned to use his exercises
    for back and neck pain assert that for the first time they could effectively manage
    -- or banish -- their own pain. p.s. a word to the wise: before beginning this,
    or any other exercise program designed to reduce pain from any condition, consult
    your doctor.'

    i am a registered nurse employed in a hospital. my daughter passed away in december
    from breast cancer. i worked up until two weeks prior to my daughter''s death.
    during that time, i made no mention to my co-workers about my daughter''s grave
    condition. it was just too sad. three weeks before my daughter died, my supervisor
    called me into her office and told me i had a "bad attitude." i admit that i had
    kept my feelings to myself, and of course my demeanor reflected a sad expression,
    but my attitude was never "bad." i quickly responded to my supervisor, in my defense,
    that my daughter was dying and asked her how i was supposed to act. she told me
    there were other nurses who had gravely ill children, but they didn''t behave
    the way i did. i replied that she should walk a mile in my shoes. she reiterated
    that i had a "bad attitude." i responded that since she seemed to be such an authority
    on behavior and dying children, perhaps she could enlighten me on how to "act"
    -- because i really didn''t know. i have since returned to work, and i now have
    a strong dislike for this person. i see her daily, and she has the nerve to speak
    to me after that unpleasant encounter. abby, how do i get past this? she has apologized

    my family and i participated in last year''s operation dear abby. it was a blessing
    to us. we sent a box of 40 cards to each address you listed. we realize that is
    an insignificant number when compared to the number of military personnel who
    are away from home, but my children are 12 and 7, so that was as many as we could
    handle. they were not happy when i asked them to sign so many cards, but we did
    one box each week to keep us from getting writer''s cramp and to keep the postage
    costs manageable. as we sent out each batch of cards, we looked on the internet
    for information about that area. this "activated" my kids. they talked about their
    new knowledge with their classmates and teachers. i sent the addresses to their
    teachers, and the classes sent out cards, too. we didn''t do it for recognition,
    but we received three thank-you cards from commanders. this "family time" turned
    out to be so much more than just that -- my children learned a valuable life lesson:
    the importance of our military and the fact that these people are real, not fictitious

    accompanied by other friends with no other word to me than, "talk to you later!"

    car, bringing her food, you name it. i don''t know what to do. i have respected
    her privacy and given her all the space she seems to need, and i hate to walk
    away. this feeling of being left standing on the back porch while she''s running

    early this year, my brother and i both announced our engagements and agreed that
    our wedding dates would be within six months of each other. we''re both in our
    early 20s, still living at home, and our parents are well-to-do. immediately after
    the announcements, our parents told us they could only give me (the bride) $7,000,
    and my brother would get half that amount. considering the cost of weddings these
    days, this would hardly cover 25 percent of the expenses, but there was nothing
    we could do, so we went along with it. our parents explained that they were in
    a tight financial situation at the moment, and this was all they were willing
    to put out for our weddings. exactly one month later, our parents purchased another
    home! our family home is already large, but they consider the second house an
    "investment property." both my brother and i are extremely hurt by this -- after
    being told that our parents were in a "financial bind," they were somehow able
    to scrape up the money for a new house. neither of us is planning a very large
    wedding -- only 150 guests or so -- but some of the money would have to cover
    our parents'' guests, as well as ours. our parents don''t seem to understand this
    and are standing their ground, saying they have supported us all our lives, but
    they are not responsible for paying for our weddings. they have also asked that
    since we both work, my brother and i start paying them rent until our wedding
    dates. we feel we should be saving our money at this time, but once again, our
    parents don''t see it that way. i am a 4.0 college graduate, have worked and gone
    to school at the same time, and have always tried to be the model daughter. abby,

    i have a major dilemma. i began dating "edward" six months ago. edward''s grandmother
    and i took a special interest in each other and soon became great friends. three
    months later, she fell ill and passed on. god rest her soul. now the problem:
    she left her entire estate to me! this includes property, two cars, her home and
    a handsome sum of money. the family was shocked to learn of this, and so was i.
    now i''m afraid edward''s family resents me. should i hand everything over to
    her only remaining son, edward''s father, or keep it? i am not sure if i should
    honor her wishes or make the family happy. i really love edward and hope to have
    a serious future with him. i don''t want any ill will with his family. please

    i was always interested in computers and pretty adept at working with them, so
    i combined this interest with my love for graphic design and began producing small
    web pages for friends. one of the pages i designed was seen by a large new york
    advertising company, and it started throwing me clients so i could make some extra
    cash. their in-house designer was a whiz with pen and paper, but keyboard and
    mouse were foreign concepts to him. within two months, i was able to quit my full-time
    job and design full time, and was earning more than before. i loved the work and
    didn''t mind the deadlines. my family seemed pleased that i was doing well in
    a job i enjoyed. three months later, i got a call from the executive v.p. of the
    firm. he asked if i wanted to be the new v.p. of the newly created computer graphics
    development department. it meant a move to new york, but a generous salary with
    perks and benefits. i took the job and left for the big apple. although i came
    home as often as time would allow, i was now regarded as "the successful one with
    no time for his family." at my younger brother''s wedding, i gave them a beautiful

    after many hours of delays and waiting, my parents and i finally got on a plane
    to return home. when the flight landed, we sat on the runway for almost an hour
    waiting for a gate to open up. a man in the row behind us turned on his cell phone
    and called someone explaining the situation, using the "f" word in between just
    about every word he said. he was standing in the aisle and his voice was loud.
    my father turned and said, "excuse me, but there are women and children on this
    plane. would you mind watching your language, please?" the man became belligerent
    and said, "no one could hear me!" then my mother piped up, "i could hear you."
    someone traveling with this foul-mouthed person turned to my father and said,
    "you don''t know who you are messing with!" next thing i knew, another person
    involved himself, verbally abusing and threatening my father. the flight attendant
    just stood there and watched the entire episode without saying a word. abby, the
    exchange left me feeling that there is no common decency left in this world. instead
    of saying, "oh, i''m sorry, i didn''t realize i was talking so loud," or, "i apologize
    for using that language in front of your wife and daughter," he looked for an

    a year and a half ago, my wife of 18 years confessed to an infidelity i had feared
    in the back of my mind all along. in our second year together, i was in the military.
    we were stationed overseas. we had a small group of friends -- couples and singles
    -- who partied three or four nights a week. we never allowed the parties to get
    too crazy, but occasionally someone would sleep overnight on our couch if they
    weren''t sober enough to drive home. one evening i returned from work very tired,
    and after a few beers, i retired early. a few friends were still hanging around,
    but were leaving soon. it happened in the adjacent room with one of my best friends,
    while our 2-year-old and i slept. since i found out the truth, i have experienced
    all of the emotions -- betrayal, sadness, shock, hatred, anxiety, denial, etc.
    after talking to two family counselors, three preachers, a psychiatrist, my parents,
    god, reading tons of books, fishing, taking countless long walks trying to reason
    why -- and finally attempting to talk to her alone -- what else can i do? (she
    refuses to discuss it further.) it still bothers me every single day. there has
    to be some relief from this continuous bad feeling i am trying desperately to
    get rid of. nothing has worked so far. i don''t want to say divorce is the answer,

    your readers may be interested to know that the funeral consumers alliance inc.
    provides an end-of-life planning kit that includes a 20-page booklet, "before
    i go, you should know," in which they can record their wishes. it comes in a plastic
    document pouch, with a refrigerator magnet to indicate its storage location. it
    contains a checklist of other documents that should also be added to the pouch.
    (veterans, for example, might want to add their dd 214 discharge papers that will
    be needed to get the free cemetery marker and american flag.) most important,
    the pouch includes a state-specified living will and durable power of attorney
    for health care. surveys show that 85 percent of the public supports the idea
    of living wills -- but only 25 percent have done anything about it. we want to
    get the kits into the refrigerator of every adult american. why the refrigerator?
    because most people have one, and it''s likely to survive a fire. by having a
    specific place to "file" these papers, perhaps more families will actually get
    it done. we hope that more families will begin talking about their choices, as
    recommended in the pamphlet from partnership in caring that is enclosed in the
    kit. also included is a brochure titled "death away from home" that''s meant to
    be popped into a suitcase or rv when traveling. abby, i hope you''ll agree this

    my eyes with her hand and ask, "can you tell me where the exits are?" she made
    it a game that was fun, but she was serious about teaching the lesson. i''ve always
    remembered it, because it''s a very important one. no matter where people are,
    everyone needs to know how to escape safely if fire should break out. that''s
    why i''ve joined the non-profit national fire protection association in its public
    safety efforts during fire prevention week 2000. nfpa''s campaign is called "fire
    drills: the great escape!" its goal is to encourage people everywhere to plan
    and practice their own fire drills, especially in their homes, where eight out
    of 10 fire deaths occur. when was the last time you had a fire drill? please,
    take a few minutes to walk through your home with your family and identify at
    least two escape routes in case a fire blocks one of them. then practice using
    them, and choose a specific place outside to assemble and make sure that everyone
    is safe and wait for the fire department. also, if you haven''t done it lately,
    test your smoke alarms to be sure they''re working. abby, i hope your readers
    will take this message to heart. fire is fast -- so fast, you may have only a
    few moments to get out. however, if you react quickly, you can survive a fire.
    fire drills really are the "great escape." planning ahead and practicing carefully
    are the keys to survival. -- sen. edward m. kennedy, nfpa honorary chair, fire
    prevention week 2000'

    i recently became engaged and am looking for just the right dress. the issue i
    am having trouble with is that i have a rather large tattoo of an orchid on my
    chest. i''m not sure if it would be appropriate to expose the tattoo at the wedding.
    i also have other tattoos on my wrist and shoulders that may be exposed. our families
    are not formally religious and they have seen the tattoos before, but i''m afraid

    my aunt ida lived to be 108. she remained rational and alert to the end. one day
    she asked, "why do i have to stay around so long? what good am i? is there any

    said: "ida, you''re here because of your smile. you have the brightest smile in

    the letter from "happily married husband" was on target! as a husband in a marriage
    of 53 years and the father of three, i would like to add that the children are
    the husband''s children, too. he should be grateful his wife gives time and love
    to his children. women carry the children in their bodies. giving birth is an
    awesome event in their lives. nursing, nurturing and attending to children is
    absorbing. why wouldn''t their relationship with their children be intense? today''s
    women often work full time outside the home and do most of the household chores.
    how much time and energy does a wife have left for a husband? i suggest that instead
    of pursuing another woman, a husband be understanding of his wife; that he spend
    more time and love on his children; and that he make time to occasionally get
    away for brief dates with his wife. chances are his wife loves him, too. if he
    sticks with her, he''ll have a loving companion for life. memories of family fun
    and laughs, hardships overcome together, best efforts made with child rearing,
    and pride in the marriage all make a husband''s life fulfilling. try it! -- happily

    welcome to holland by emily perl kingsley i am often asked to describe the experience
    of raising a child with a disability -- to try to help people who have not shared
    the unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. it''s like
    this ... when you''re going to have a baby, it''s like planning a fabulous vacation
    trip -- to italy. you buy a bunch of guidebooks and make your wonderful plans.
    the coliseum. michelangelo''s "david." the gondolas in venice. you may learn some
    handy phrases in italian. it''s all very exciting. after months of eager anticipation,
    the day finally arrives. you pack your bags and off you go. several hours later,
    the plane lands. the flight attendant comes and says, "welcome to holland." "holland?!"
    you say. "what do you mean, holland? i signed up for italy! i''m supposed to be
    in italy. all my life i''ve dreamed of going to italy." but there''s been a change
    in the flight plan. they''ve landed in holland and there you must stay. the important
    thing is that they haven''t taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place
    full of pestilence, famine and disease. it''s just a different place. so you must
    go out and buy new guidebooks. you must learn a whole new language. and you will
    meet a whole new group of people you would never have met. it''s just a different
    place. it''s slower-paced than italy, less flashy than italy. but after you''ve
    been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around, and you begin
    to notice that holland has windmills, holland has tulips, holland even has rembrandts.
    but everyone you know is busy coming and going from italy, and they''re all bragging
    about what a wonderful time they had there. and for the rest of your life, you
    will say, "yes, that''s where i was supposed to go. that''s what i had planned."
    and the pain of that will never, ever, ever go away, because the loss of that
    dream is a very significant loss. but if you spend your life mourning the fact
    that you didn''t get to italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special,
    the very lovely things about holland.'

    i just returned from the gym, and i feel terrible. my friend, "norm," and i are
    experienced racquetball players, but only recently began playing against each
    other. norm has never beaten me and is rarely able to keep the score close. i
    recently read about a man in his 70s -- a scratch golfer -- who occasionally loses
    to lesser players when he feels they could use an ego boost. of course, the other
    player has no idea that he has been allowed to win. when i got to the gym this
    morning for my game with norm, he began his litany of woes: divorced, estranged
    from family, barely ekes out a good living, etc. i immediately thought about the
    golf story, and decided that norm would win today. the game started strongly in
    norm''s favor. i had my hands full just trying to keep up with him. i had decided
    to keep it close -- hit most of the shots to his strong forehand and avoid his
    weak backhand at all costs. several times i had to rally to tie up the score.
    before long, norm had 20 points to my 15 (21 wins it). at that point i did all
    i could to feed his forehand, not hit any tough shots and let him make the winning
    shot. he was unable to do so. finally, after a long volley, norm hit the ball
    to me in a perfect "kill" situation. before i knew what had happened, the game
    was over. i had won again. afterward, i told norm he had played a great game and
    complimented him on his effort. however, my words felt hollow. i had won. he had
    lost. the opportunity was gone. i feel miserable. my competitive nature would

    i am confused. i received an invitation to my uncle''s 80th birthday party, which
    is being given by his children. the invitation states, "no presents but your presence."
    the other night my sister and mother asked me what i was giving to my uncle for
    his birthday. i said nothing but a card, as the invitation requested. my mother
    said she knows what the invitation said, but she was going to give him money,
    and my sister said she wasn''t sure what she was giving, but she knows that my
    cousins would give "something" to my father under similar circumstances. i was
    viewed as "difficult" by both of them because i feel strongly that you follow
    what an invitation requests, and it''s unfair to others not to. my sister said,
    "why is it that the people who choose not to do what they want are made to feel
    awkward?" i answered, "it''s not you who''s made to feel awkward; it''s the people

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i read the "ten commandments for mothers-in-law" in your column. it implies that
    if the relationship is troubled, the fault is hers. however, relationships are
    a two-way street. my son -- a "rescuer" -- married an insecure, controlling young
    woman. she is threatened by any participation on our part in their lives. our
    son seems happy in his marriage, so we are getting on with our own lives without
    involvement with them or our grandchildren. a tragedy? yes. one we can fix from
    our end? no. (ironically, i scored high on your "commandments for mothers-in-law.")
    adult children also bear a responsibility for making the relationship a success.
    to all daughters-in-law and sons-in-law who read the "ten commandments for mothers-in-law"
    and said, "amen!" i offer this slightly modified version: ten commandments for
    a daughter-in-law 1. thou shalt love, honor and respect your mother-in-law and
    father-in-law. 2. thou shalt allow them complete independence. 3. thou shalt speak
    only kindly and loyally about them. 4. thou shalt not find fault. 5. thou shalt
    not visit them too frequently, and never enter their home without knocking. 6.
    thou shalt say thank you when they do something nice for you or your children.
    7. thou shalt not give them advice unless requested. 8. thou shalt not deny them
    access to their grandchildren as a bargaining chip to get what you want. 9. thou
    shalt respect their taste in home decorating, though it differs from your own.
    10. thou shalt petition the heavenly father, in whose love they abide, for their
    happiness. i would also suggest that daughters-in-law remember that they are providing
    their children with a blueprint for how they themselves should be treated one
    day in the future when they become mothers-in-law. please print this, abby. i
    know i speak for tens of thousands of mothers-in-law who will read this and say,
    "amen!" -- disappointed mother-in-law'

    i have a question regarding the proper way to pay someone back when they "pick

    would you like anything?" they come back from the store and won''t accept any
    money. we always intend to repay these people for the products they purchase.

    her within the year. we don''t live together. on several occasions, before or
    after showering or getting dressed, she has walked around her house with no clothes
    on. of course, it doesn''t bother me to see her naked. this is her home, and she
    has a right to do as she wishes. the problem i have is that she sees no problem
    in being naked in front of her son. she even showers with him. i realize this
    is her child, and she feels comfortable being naked around him. i was not raised
    this way. when i mentioned it, it caused a little tension. am i being overly sensitive?

    my mother died recently. she was ill for five years and lived at home. four of
    her adult children lived in the area. one of my sisters took it upon herself to
    set up mom''s medications and regularly take her to her many doctor''s appointments.
    the rest of us did not ask her to do this, but it was a relief to know that she
    was able to do it for mom. now that mom has passed away, my sister has submitted
    a bill to the estate for $10,000 for "services rendered." since the entire estate
    is worth only about $60,000, and the will states that everything is to be divided
    equally between all five children, the four of us feel her request is unreasonable.
    how should we handle this? no matter what we decide, someone will be angry. --

    i am 37 years old and have one older brother who is 39. when we were growing up,
    our family was very close, but something happened when my father passed away eight
    years ago. within a few years my mother remarried. soon after, my marriage to
    an abusive man fell apart. my brother decided to support my ex-husband and held
    me responsible for not giving him a "second chance." this hurt me deeply. when
    my mother recently divorced -- her husband wanted the divorce -- again, my brother
    took the husband''s side. my brother''s wife is a born-again christian and doesn''t
    believe in divorce, no matter what the reason. my mother is heartbroken and so
    am i. i always looked up to my brother. i wish i knew it was his wife''s influence
    and not his choice. he promised our father on his deathbed that he would take
    care of us. not only has he walked away from us in our time of need, he has sided

    my mother-in-law, who lives with us, still clings to the cultural values of the
    old country and expects everybody to conform to them. this sometimes results in
    confrontation and ill feelings among family members. my son, who is 16, frequently
    brings friends home. most of the time he remembers to introduce them to the family
    members, but there are times when he thinks he has already introduced them, so
    he doesn''t. my mother-in-law gets upset when the young people who show up at
    home do not acknowledge her. she comes from a culture steeped in values such as
    respect for elders. she feels these young guests should greet her, or smile at
    her, and that they have to do it first before she will return the greeting. although
    i value such traditions, in my opinion she does not have to wait. she can initiate
    the introduction. i told her she should just say hello to them and ask them nonchalantly
    to introduce themselves. she is adamant that she should be greeted first. i explained
    that we do not know if these young people are shy, or whether they have not been
    properly taught by their own parents. none of the kids are overtly rude, either
    to my mother-in-law or me. who is right in this instance? -- modern mother, cerritos,

    i am 50 and have been divorced for two years after a 29-year marriage that was,
    at times, physically and emotionally abusive. i work full-time and attend college
    full-time. two loving and caring friends have helped me through the bad times
    with encouragement and advice. i often heed their advice, since most of the time
    it has been good and held true. however, i recently made a decision that has caused
    a rift between us and this disturbs me. my son (age 30) and my daughter-in-law
    (24) have invited me to live with them until i complete my schooling, and i have
    accepted their invitation. this eases my financial burden (tuition, books, bills,
    life) greatly. they both have good jobs, no children yet, and are solid and easygoing.
    my girlfriends are appalled that i could live with my children who have been married
    only two years! they feel i would be invading their privacy and giving up mine,
    along with my independence. i assured them that this is only a temporary arrangement,
    since i have only a year and a half to finish school. i told them the most important
    factor is that it is ok with my children and ok with me. my kids and i have discussed
    privacy issues and personal issues, and we all feel very comfortable with this.
    one of my friends said she wouldn''t visit me at their home because she would
    "feel uncomfortable." my other friend told me she just doesn''t feel that this
    is right. i love my friends dearly, but i am getting that eerie feeling of "control"
    from them that i had in my marriage. am i right, or just paranoid? i''m afraid
    of making the wrong decision. my children and i really do feel comfortable with
    the whole thing. should i tell my friends it''s time to "let me go" and lead my
    own life now? my friends also disagree with the friendship my ex-husband, his
    wife and i have. my ex and i both sought counseling during and after our divorce
    which uncovered a lot of hurt and allowed a lot of healing for both of us. help!
    these two are driving me crazy! -- jane in yakima, wash.'

    i know you have heard in-law horror stories for decades, but i believe mine takes
    the cake. my in-laws actually threw a second wedding reception for our guests
    because they didn''t feel ours had enough food. it was a catered affair in their
    home immediately following ours. when i had children, they told me they knew their
    daughter''s children were their "real" grandchildren, but they could never be
    too sure mine were! they save their cruelest words for me and our children for
    when my husband is not around. they call my husband "henpecked" because ours is
    an equal partnership, and he shares in the child-rearing, cooking, cleaning and
    shopping. my mother-in-law complained last year that my husband is "too close"
    to his children. she says if my husband has time to coach our son''s soccer team,
    he should have time to fix their storm windows. my in-laws have repeatedly returned
    gifts to me saying, "i never cared for that scent of perfume" or "this shirt makes
    me look long-waisted." they have also overindulged my husband''s sister''s children
    to such a degree that neighbors and other family members have commented on it
    over the years. my husband has truly supported me throughout these in-law tribulations.
    we have a fantastic marriage. my problem is, after 18 years of being on the receiving
    end of these absurd in-law antics, my elderly in-laws expect me to assist them.
    they are now in their 80s and infirm. my husband feels obligated to assist his

    are others like me. i have had tests, and they confirm that this is genetic. in

    happier than i have ever been, and i plan to finish my transition over the next

    around me, changing gradually rather than shocking them by completely altering

    do come, they socialize only with each other. when i was a teen-ager, if we did
    not want to attend a family gathering, we stayed home; we did not invite our friends.

    you replied to a funeral director: "the answer lies in being informed consumers,
    facing the fact of our mortality, and perhaps taking care of the details before
    the need arises. an important part of that process is being open with one''s family
    about what one''s wishes are, and what arrangements have been made." well, abby,
    i am a realist and have faced the fact of my mortality. i have a will, a durable
    power of attorney for health-care decisions, and a general power of attorney in
    case i become mentally impaired. i have designated my only child, a daughter,
    to carry out these decisions. when i try to talk to her about my affairs after
    my death, she says she just can''t talk to me about such things. she is very squeamish
    about the whole subject. she is married to a lawyer, and they don''t even have
    a will. trying to tell my family my wishes hasn''t seemed to work. do you have
    another suggestion for me? -- fresno, calif.'

    i was a single mother throughout my only child''s early years. i had no financial
    or moral support from the child''s father. luckily, i had a good job that enabled
    me to take good care of my daughter. i did not believe in giving my child a stepfather,
    so i remained single. my daughter had a good religious education, loving home,
    a dedicated and adoring mother, vacations, the best schools, health care, etc.
    we enjoyed a wonderful and loving relationship. however, as soon as my daughter
    became a teen-ager, she decided to stop calling me "mother." she insisted on addressing
    me by my first name because i was her "friend." for years, we have had numerous
    discussions on that subject -- me explaining my unhappiness, she insisting on
    using my first name and ignoring my hurt feelings. i never wanted to be referred
    to as one of her many friends. i wanted to be called "mother." at 49 years old
    and married (no children), she has lived out-of-town for many years and her attitude
    is cold and distant. her friends are the center of her life. how do you explain
    such treatment? i now have the opportunity to become a foster mother to a child.
    i would insist that this child call me "mother." unfortunately, i fear that my
    desire to be called "mother" is based only on the longing to be called that by
    my own child. under such circumstances, should i go ahead and bring this young
    child into my home, maybe making her unhappy and leaving myself vulnerable for
    another disappointment in life? -- disappointed mother in florida'

    i recently overheard a conversation between two young women in their 20s. they
    were lamenting the fact that they smile too much because of cultural and social
    conditioning. they seemed to feel they must be "tougher" to succeed in the business
    world. abby, i have had a varied career as a museum manager, an office coordinator
    for a law firm and a property manager for a 33-story building. i was a competent,
    intelligent student in school, but by no means at the top of my class. i have
    a fine arts degree and reasonable computer skills. a short time ago, i walked
    out of a new job because i didn''t like the way my employer screamed at people.
    within three days, i had three job offers. (i hadn''t even begun to look for new
    employment.) the reason? i smile. when someone walks into my office, i smile and
    greet the person pleasantly. whether that someone is my boss, a client, co-worker,
    vendor or cleaning lady, i smile and am pleasant. i say please, thank you, and
    apologize for my mistakes. one employer said, "it''s easier to train a smiler
    to use excel than to teach a computer-literate sourpuss to smile. in the final
    analysis, it comes down to choosing whom i want to spend my day with." -- sonya

    i would like to share my mother''s method of handling an obscene phone call. she
    became feeble and hard-of-hearing several years before she died. the telephone
    was one of her main luxuries and necessities. we live in a rural area, and obscene
    calls were unusual. i returned from work one afternoon and went to check on her.
    with a gleeful voice, she announced, "i got an obscene phone call last night."
    shocked, i asked, "mama, what did you do?" she said it took her a few minutes
    to realize what the young man was saying. then she started preaching -- book,
    chapter and verse. mama was a saintly soul with a great working knowledge of the
    bible. after several minutes, the man yelled at her, "hey, lady, you''re supposed
    to shut up and let me do the talking!" she retorted, "no, boy, i have a lot of
    things to say that you need to hear!" in a disappointed tone she added, "... and
    then he hung up on me." to my knowledge, she never received another obscene phone
    call. -- missing mama in louisiana'

    i''ve noticed that some of your readers have been discussing the "value" of our
    seniors. as an assisted-living administrator, i feel compelled to send this message
    to the children of our seniors. you have not become your parent''s parent. you
    do not have autonomy when it comes to decisions about your parents'' lives. what
    you do have is the obligation to assist your parent in making informed, appropriate
    choices. this means when your parent needs help with anything from finances to
    daily care, you gather information and then discuss the choices with your parents.
    then, as a family, you arrive at decisions -- but your parents have the final
    say. even people who have memory problems, such as early-stage dementia or alzheimer''s
    disease, retain some ability to provide input into decisions regarding their care
    and living arrangements. if you have a parent''s power of attorney, you can make
    financial decisions. period. you cannot "sign" them into a nursing home, assisted-living
    facility or rehabilitation center. you may do that only if you have been appointed
    their "legal guardian" or have their "health care proxy," and their md certifies
    in writing that they are no longer able to participate in making decisions regarding
    their care. for those with aging parents, my message is that you and your parent
    should start visiting independent and assisted-living homes, rehabilitation centers
    and nursing homes. gather as much information as possible. sit down with mom or
    dad and discuss scenarios that "could" happen -- such as memory loss, hip fracture,
    etc. helping your parents make choices in advance will prevent decisions made
    from panic, instead of logic. our biggest fear is of the unknown. our seniors
    have earned the right not to worry, "what will happen if i can''t take care of
    myself anymore?" they deserve the right to make that choice for themselves. --

    last month, your column carried a letter about people receiving advertisements
    for weight-loss products with supposedly "personal" post-it notes attached, advising

    an initial. i immediately wrote to thank you for running that letter because i
    received one of those ads two years ago, and it was hurtful. would you believe
    yet another one of those ads arrived in the mail yesterday? this time it is for
    a product that will purportedly ignite a man''s sexual performance, but the post-it
    was omitted. written in ballpoint pen in the margin was the same little message,

    latest mailing laughable is that i am an 86-year-old single woman who has been
    without a mate for almost 12 years. what do i need this for? the advertisement
    featured a picture of a man who is supposed to be a doctor, and a california postmark
    -- but, of course, no return address. so much for this "amazing formula ... a

    my wife and i recently discovered that my son and his girlfriend, "lois," are
    sexually active. they have been seeing each other about nine months and both of
    them will be 18 in a few months. when her parents found out, they called us and
    the six of us had a discussion at our home. lois'' father suggested -- and i agreed
    -- that they should stay apart for a time and think about their relationship and
    the consequences of sexual activity. at the time, i presumed that they would be
    allowed to see each other again at some point. abby, these are basically good
    kids. neither experiments with drugs. both get good grades and are involved in

    my daughter and son-in-law earn twice as much as my wife and i do. they insist
    that we visit them each year in california. my wife and i both have arthritis
    and find a heated pool therapeutic. they have a swimming pool, but they expect
    us to pay to heat it when we visit. this is embarrassing because my three stepdaughters
    never expect us to pay for anything when we visit them, and we never ask our children
    to pay for anything when they visit in our home. last year, my son who lives in
    ohio paid to have his sister''s pool heated while we were visiting in california.

    i was recently named executor and sole beneficiary of the estate of a dear relative
    who passed away. one of my cousins had the nerve to contact the attorney for the
    estate and demand to know why she hadn''t received her inheritance. please, let
    me share a few "truths" that may save a lot of time, expense and hurt feelings
    for other families: 1. people of sound mind have the right to disburse their assets
    the way they choose. 2. no one owes anyone anything at the time of death (beyond
    paying personal debts, and final medical and funeral expenses). 3. an inheritance
    is a gift, not an obligation. 4. if your name is not on the list of beneficiaries,
    the deceased obviously had his or her reasons not to leave you anything. if you
    loved and cared about the person who died, you will always have beautiful memories
    to treasure -- and in the end, isn''t that what really matters? -- blessed in

    i can''t believe that "sleepless in new jersey" complained because her husband
    woke her at 4 a.m. to say goodbye before leaving for work. my husband also gets
    up at 4 a.m., but i am right by his side -- fixing his breakfast, packing his
    lunch, kissing him goodbye, making sure he starts his day off right. a hassle?
    sure it is, but i do it because my husband sacrifices for our family each day
    by working at a job that requires him to get up early so i can stay at home with
    the children. i have three young children to take care of, a home-based business
    and many other things i give my all to each day. i am sometimes tired and do occasionally
    nap. my husband is able to come back in the afternoon, and the rest of the day
    is family time. it sounds to me as though "sleepless''s" husband is doing anything
    he can to make her pay some attention to him. any book on divorce will tell her
    that if she doesn''t fulfill her husband''s needs, he''ll find someone who will.
    she may find that if she thinks less of herself and puts forth more effort for
    her husband, she may no longer need separate bedrooms. -- has a great marriage

    i am a 43-year-old divorcee who recently broke off a two-year relationship with
    a 50-year-old divorced man. we were dating "steadily" (every night and every weekend),
    and i thought he was faithful and loved me, as he so frequently declared. i dropped
    by unexpectedly a year ago, and i caught a woman hiding in his bedroom closet.
    before that, he picked up a girl (a stranger!) at a cafeteria at noon and took
    her home. i accidentally dropped by that time, too. then i discovered e-mails
    he had sent to the closet-girl setting up more meetings. (she would come over
    before i got off work at 5 each night.) there were also e-mails to other women
    across the country arranging dates. (he''s a pilot.) each time i caught him being
    unfaithful, he''d beg me to forgive his indiscretions. i tried, but i couldn''t
    trust him. his schedule is such that he has lots of free time during the day when
    i''m at work, so my imagination would run rampant. he was unfaithful in his marriage,
    too. i think he has no intention of ever being faithful to one woman, and that

    may i add my experience to the letter from "disgusted in indiana," who believes
    that it''s sacrilegious to list pets in obituaries as survivors of a loved one?
    i couldn''t disagree more. i find it obscene to have to include someone who didn''t
    live up to the part. my husband and i were married more than 30 years. he was
    very good to his mother. she didn''t return the favor. she mostly took from him.
    i watched her divorce herself from anything distasteful. my husband was diagnosed
    with cancer, and although he fought it with all his might, there came the terrible
    time when the doctor told me he would not survive. i had to tell my mother-in-law,
    who quite matter-of-factly told me she didn''t want to see him but wished to remember
    him "the way he was." she never saw or talked to him again. i brought him home
    so he could pass away there. our pets never turned away from him, but gave him
    great joy. his mother could have done the same, but didn''t. i wanted his obituary
    to include those he loved and those who loved him back. it never occurred to me
    not to include our pets. i felt obligated to include his mother strictly because
    she was his mother, not because she deserved to be included. -- mourning in california'

    i recently took my father to my 11-year-old son''s little league game. while my
    son''s team was at bat, a ball was hit up the first base line. the first baseman
    made a gallant attempt to catch the ball, but missed and it went into the outfield.
    the right fielder stopped the runner at second base, and my father shouted to
    the first baseman, "you should have made that play!" concerned that he would hurt
    the boy''s feelings, i told dad he shouldn''t shout at the boy. my father then
    became angry with me and said the boy needs to know that he "screwed up" so he

    i met a really nice guy at a child''s birthday party. about a week later we ran
    into each other at a museum. we talked and exchanged e-mail addresses. a week
    later i e-mailed him and the conversations began. i found out he was unhappily
    married. we continued to e-mail each other. during every conversation, he told
    me how much he wanted to remove himself from his marriage; however, he didn''t
    want to leave his children. he asked several times to take me to lunch or dinner.
    because he was married, i refused. then last january, he asked if he could take
    me out for my birthday. i agreed to lunch. we had a wonderful two hours, and i
    kissed him at the end of lunch. what a great kiss it was! in march, he moved out
    of their home and into his own place. then he filed for legal separation. (i saw
    the paper with both signatures.) since his move, his wife has begun to question
    him about seeing other people. according to him, she doesn''t want him back, but
    she doesn''t want him with anyone else. she insists he keep the children every
    weekend and any evening he isn''t working. over the past month, our communication
    has declined. he''s exhausted from working two jobs and spending every non-working
    moment with the children. he says repeatedly that he wants us to continue seeing
    each other, but he no longer has the time to see me or even e-mail me. frankly,
    i don''t see his wife changing her pattern anytime soon. last weekend, he told
    her he couldn''t pick up the children on friday night because he had "other plans."
    when he arrived at his apartment, she was sitting in the parking lot and insisted
    he take the children. he refused; she became angry and violent. he did not pick
    up the children that evening, but picked them up bright and early saturday morning.

    have you noticed how often people fail to get out of the way of electric carts
    used to transport people who can''t walk long distances at airports? it isn''t
    pure cussedness. it''s because the "warning beep" used by these carts is near
    a sound frequency that cannot be easily processed by the human ear. (see: "how
    we localize sound" by w.m. hartmann in the november 1999 issue of physics today.)
    thus, airline commuters cannot tell where the sound is coming from, which is hazardous
    to both walkers and riders. this is actually a common engineering blunder. the
    "beep" to announce an incoming fax on a computer modem and the beep of a modern
    range timer are both typically at a pitch just above the hearing range of a host
    of older people. the back-up beeper on trucks and heavy equipment is also in the
    same frequency range. (the higher sound frequencies are usually the first to go.)
    we all know that engineers are set in their ways, but perhaps a wake-up call from
    you will jolt them out of their ruts. -- jack salisbury, palm coast, fla.'

    i have started this letter to you a hundred times, but have never been able to
    finish it. i hope you will print it. when i was 16, my mother had a baby -- my
    only sister. mom was almost 40 and my brother was 12. after we adjusted to the
    shock, my sister became the joy of our life. her smile could banish the gloomies,
    and she was a treasure to us all. sadly, less than two years later (only three
    weeks after my high school graduation), my best friend -- who lived next door
    -- accidentally backed her car over my sister, killing her instantly. my little
    sister had escaped from our back yard without our family''s knowledge. it was
    the worst day of my life, and worse still for my friend. my parents did their
    best to comfort her, but her large family included her own baby sister who was
    nearly the same age as mine and was a constant reminder of the tragedy. abby,
    people drive through our neighborhood far too fast. i want to run after them and
    shout, "don''t you know you could never stop at this speed if a child ran in front
    of your car? don''t you know that if you kill a child, there will be two deaths?
    your life will be over, too." my family recovered from my sister''s death, but
    my friend never did. the accident ruined her life. she had been at the top of
    her class, and everyone expected a bright future for her. instead, she lived through
    failed counseling, broken marriages, and her career crashed -- all because of
    a tragic accident that wasn''t her fault. she just couldn''t forgive herself.
    at our 20th high-school reunion, a former classmate asked me, "hey, whatever happened
    to that girl who killed that kid?" i responded, "that girl was our class secretary
    and my best friend, and that kid was my sister." please remind your readers that
    no car needs a heavy foot on the gas while navigating a residential area. and
    for good measure, before starting a car, walk the long way around to the driver''s
    door so you can check behind the vehicle. investing a few extra seconds for safety
    may save a precious child''s life -- and your own as well. -- lonely sister in

    the letters about obscene phone calls reminded me of something that happened when
    i was a teen-ager. a group of us would hang out at "charlie''s" house after school
    and on weekends. we''d play pingpong, cards, watch tv or just "shoot the breeze."
    one night, a boy named "mark" began making obscene phone calls. he would dial
    random numbers, make a few crude remarks, and then hang up and laugh. we all wanted
    him to stop, afraid the calls could be traced and we''d all get in trouble. he
    refused. he said he was having too much fun to stop. another friend, "clint,"
    said he wanted to make the next call. mark handed him the phone. clint dialed
    a number, then quickly handed the phone back to mark, saying, "i''m too nervous.
    you talk." mark took the phone and made his usual crude remarks. his face turned
    white as he heard a woman say, "mark, is that you?" mark slammed the receiver
    down and asked, "what number did you dial?!" "your home phone," clint replied.
    as the rest of us howled, mark actually burst into tears. perhaps it was a cruel
    lesson, but mark never again made an obscene phone call. -- still laughing in

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    may i comment on the letter from "little abby''s mom" regarding the need for blood
    donors? i delivered my second child three months premature. he had many of the
    problems that premature babies go through. while he was in the neonatal icu, his
    bone marrow stopped making red blood cells, and he needed two transfusions. none
    of my family members were able to donate blood for him, and without the use of
    community blood, my son would have died. i am grateful to those blood donors who,
    probably without knowing it, are heroes in their own right. i am a coward when
    it comes to needles. because of this, i ask that someone hold my hand when i donate
    blood. i receive a few snickers from onlookers, but i couldn''t allow another
    mommy who may be facing the same problem to experience the anguish of not having
    "nice, clean" blood for her child. please, abby print my letter so "little abby''s
    mom" knows i said thank you for recognizing how important it is for even cowards
    like me to donate blood. it''s easy and takes only a small amount of time to help
    save the lives of so many people. -- faithful blood donor in phoenix p.s. my son
    is now 6 years old and brings joy to everyone with whom he comes in contact.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    the letter about depression and suicide prompts my own letter. only one in five
    people who suffer from a mental illness seek help. as some of those with a history
    of mental illness stated in their letters, reaching out for help is often a task
    that seems insurmountable. and broaching the subject with a loved one can be difficult
    for many reasons. fear of being told to "mind your own business" can be a big
    impediment to friends and families who would like to extend a helping hand. however,
    if you are truly concerned about a friend or loved one, the most compassionate
    action is to express that concern. how to intervene: (1) clearly outline for yourself
    the reasons you feel the person needs help. make sure they are for the person''s
    benefit -- and not for your own selfish reasons. (2) create a special time to
    express your desire to help your friend or loved one by saying you would like
    to set aside some time to talk about "something important" and asking, "when would
    be a good time?" be sure it''s in an emotionally safe environment where you won''t
    be overheard or interrupted. then communicate how important he or she is to you
    and the reasons you feel there could be a benefit from counseling. (don''t say
    what your friend or loved one is doing is "wrong.") (3) be direct, honest and
    compassionate. practice stating your reasons in a positive, non-blaming way. abby,
    let''s make it commonplace to reach out to others and say, "how are things really
    going for you? i''m not just asking to make conversation ... i''d really like
    to know because i care about you." -- dr. kevin grold, del mar, calif.'

    my letter concerns the one from "steve in minnesota," who wrote about teen-age
    pregnancy. i understand why he says people don''t realize how difficult parenthood
    is until they find out the hard way. once it happens, their lives are changed
    forever. however, these points should be made to young people before they decide
    to have children. what does it say to those who are already parents? i am a 17-year-old
    mother of a beautiful 8-month-old daughter. teen-age mothers are often perceived
    as young girls who have ruined our lives. however, we haven''t ruined our lives
    -- we have just made them a little more complicated. i earned my high school diploma
    and work at a great job in an office where i make far more than minimum wage.
    i will soon start college to pursue my dream of becoming a registered nurse. i
    played with fire and have to deal with the consequences. having kids is a responsibility
    not to be taken lightly, but it''s not the end of the world. there are plenty
    of places that help young mothers achieve their goals and open up windows of opportunity.

    after reading the letter from "steve in minnesota," may i share my experience?
    i am the result of a teen-age pregnancy. my parents dropped out of high school
    to marry six months before i was born. my sister was born three years later. within
    a year of her birth, my parents divorced. i did not have a happy childhood. my
    parents had little patience with children. mother gave custody to my father because
    she wanted to return to school. she eventually earned an engineering degree and
    has a successful career, but i seldom saw her as i was growing up. my father never
    completed high school and was frequently unemployed. both my parents had many
    problems to deal with because they became parents at such a young age. i am now
    a parent myself. i waited until i was mature enough to handle it. i can''t imagine
    being a mother at 17, like my mother was -- but i know i wouldn''t have been as
    good a parent as i am now. my husband is a terrific father and our daughter is
    a happy, well-adjusted child. -- grown-up mom in ontario, canada'

    my sister and i are married to brothers whose wealthy aunt invites the family
    for easter dinner every year. this is a potluck meal, and she requests that we
    each bring double recipes. this year, my sister was asked to bring two cakes and
    another guest to bring pies. after our main course was served, the table was cleared
    and out came thin slices of pie. there was no sign of my sister''s cakes! after
    the meal, this aunt was busy in the kitchen putting away all of the leftover food.
    no one was offered anything to take home. do you think my sister should have asked
    for her two cakes that were not served? she has a large family, and those cakes

    i have a beautiful 20-year-old daughter. she''s currently home from college for
    a break. she spends a great deal of time in our back yard sunning by the pool
    and swimming. this is fine, but my concern is that she''s doing it in the nude.
    now i am far from a prude, abby, and do most of my own sunning and swimming in
    the nude as well. my concern is that i am recently remarried, and my daughter
    doesn''t bother to cover up when my new husband is home. she seems just as comfortable
    nude in front of him as she is in front of me. this seems odd, because this is
    only the third or fourth time my daughter has met him. i am further conflicted
    because my husband obviously enjoys looking at my daughter while she''s naked.
    she has a great body. my husband has been constantly aroused, and this has been
    leading to some of the best sex i have ever had. when i thought we were falling

    is home for one more week. i''m not sure whether to say anything to her or not.

    my husband, "jake," and i have been married eight years. we get along perfectly,
    except for his family. they have conned and cheated us out of thousands of dollars
    and spread vicious rumors about me. at one point, the tension and hostility were
    unbearable, and jake and i separated. after four months, we realized that we were
    meant to be together, so we reconciled. we both gave up successful careers and
    moved 400 miles away from his family. we have been happy here for three years.
    aside from yearly holiday get-togethers, we don''t see his family -- which is
    great! about two weeks ago (just when i thought everything was going well), we
    were walking along the road and found an adorable dog giving birth to puppies.
    she was dirty, hungry and dehydrated, but she and the puppies survived under our
    care. after trying to find the owner, we realized that the dog was probably abandoned.
    well, jake mentioned the pups to his cousin "cindy" (a woman who has spread rumors
    about me), and to our horror, cindy announced she was coming the following weekend
    to "pick up the cutest pup in the litter." we never offered a puppy to her, and
    had mutually decided to keep all the dogs so we wouldn''t break up the little
    family. when jake returned cindy''s call, i heard him tell her that i wanted to
    keep all the dogs and was not giving any of them away. i feel betrayed and hurt.
    this made me wonder if the reason his family has always disliked me is that jake
    plays the "good guy" and blames decisions his family doesn''t like on me. abby,

    in march, my son was involved in a serious auto accident. "ruth," my best friend
    for almost 30 years, went to visit him at my father''s house. dad later told me
    that while she was there, she badmouthed me, my husband and our other children.
    she also talked about our finances. i feel so betrayed by ruth that i''m not sure
    i''ll ever want anything to do with her again. abby, ruth and i had been friends
    since high school. we shared our most intimate secrets over the years. i would
    never have discussed her personal business with my family, and i''m hurt that

    my 67-year-old husband has taken up with a 45-year-old married woman. we live
    in a small town, and of course everybody knows about it. as i see it, i have two

    sue him for divorce and clean his clock. i have all the evidence i need -- credit

    the husband may be the breadwinner, but he acts more like a teen-ager who turns

    six years ago, my husband and i honeymooned in french polynesia where we met three
    other newlywed couples. some older people were there also. we considered them
    intruders and were pretty rotten to them. we hogged the hammocks, beach chairs
    and best tables, made fun of their bodies and generally made their lives miserable.

    gulf coast. each year we join his houseguests for a big birthday barbecue weekend.

    one of my uncles mentioned they were going to french polynesia, so i brought our
    honeymoon pictures this year. when my father''s friend saw them, she said she
    had been there at the same time we were, recovering from a month-long camping
    trip in australia. we soon realized why she looked so "familiar." she was one
    of our victims. she must have recognized us long ago, but said nothing. we were
    so mortified, we returned to our room with a "headache." i couldn''t look at her
    the rest of the weekend and left without a word. my father knows something is

    this morning with only a few minutes to go before we needed to leave for work,

    however, i can''t imagine giving anyone the same answer he did to that question.

    a few weeks ago, my boyfriend and i became engaged. we are trying to decide whether
    to have a large wedding or elope. this is my second marriage and his first. my
    first wedding was held in the town where i lived, 2,000 miles from my parents''
    home. it was very expensive, and my parents paid for everything. they told me
    they will not pay for this wedding unless it is held in the town where they now
    live. it''s halfway across the country from where my boyfriend and i reside. neither
    of us has friends there, but my mother''s relatives live within driving distance.
    (these family members missed my first wedding because they could not afford to
    travel.) abby, my boyfriend''s parents don''t want to go that far for a wedding,
    and i think his mother is hoping we will marry in her catholic church. i suspect
    my boyfriend wants to be married in their hometown and in the church, but he doesn''t
    want to ask his parents to help pay for the wedding. i feel bad because traditionally
    the bride''s parents pay for the wedding. my mother is putting pressure on me
    because they spent a lot of money on my first wedding and her family wasn''t able
    to attend. my boyfriend and i cannot afford to pay for a wedding, so we have considered
    eloping or having a small wedding where we live with only family and close friends
    attending. we could then have two receptions, one here, and one in my parents''
    area. my parents might pay for a reception there. abby, is this a proper solution,
    or will people think we are cheap? and will this offend either set of parents?
    i''m willing to go with the flow, but i''m not sure in which direction it is flowing.

    is around her, but my son is very much an adolescent at heart. lois comes to our

    home from school and his father and i are still at work. i don''t think it has
    turned into a sexual relationship yet, but i know it is not purely platonic in
    nature. i''m trying very hard to discourage this relationship, but eric tells
    me they share the same hopes for the future, and he really likes being with her.

    i am the father of a 7-year-old daughter who takes swimming lessons through a
    community program. recently, the instructor -- a high school girl -- showed up
    for class wearing a swimsuit that became mostly transparent when wet. this made
    me very uncomfortable. after class, i mentioned to her that i felt her swimsuit
    was too revealing and inappropriate for a class of grade school-age children and
    their parents. two days later, her supervisor called and told me she had received
    a complaint from the instructor. the instructor had interpreted my comment as
    "putting the moves on her." her supervisor, who was not in class that day, told
    me i should have ignored the situation, and if it really bothered me, i should
    have called her instead of talking with the instructor. i''ve been told i cannot
    speak to this young woman when i see her in class, and she will no longer be allowed
    to work with my daughter. i am happily married, and i have no desire or need to
    look elsewhere for a sexual turn-on. however, it is hard to ignore a young woman''s
    breasts when they are staring you in the face. i feel that this situation has
    been blown out of proportion, and if the instructor were my daughter, i would
    want someone to tell her if her clothing was inappropriate. have we gotten to
    the point with sexual harassment that we can''t help another person who is being
    ogled in public? what would you have done in this situation? -- sorry i noticed

    please help! i caught my 11-year-old son sneaking in my bedroom going through

    twelve years ago, my brother was in a financial bind. he stood to lose his home
    and possibly his livelihood. he asked my husband and me to buy part of his farmland
    so that he could use the cash to pay off his debts. we live on a fixed income,
    but we had some investments pay out so we had the cash to purchase the land. we
    agreed to let him continue to farm the land, and he was to pay us one-third of
    the income as rent. we left all the details to him, as we had no reason to distrust
    him. however, we recently discovered that he has been receiving a government subsidy
    that he was supposed to share with us. it is not a great deal of money on a yearly
    basis, but over the past 12 years it has amounted to a few thousand dollars. my
    husband and i are hurt and disappointed over this deception. we don''t want to
    take legal action, nor do we want to embarrass him in any way. we would like to
    resolve this matter in a tactful way to permit him to save face. we discussed
    selling the land, but this would probably put him in a financial bind, and we
    don''t want to do that. my brother has a fairly good life. he owns his home free

    i was an only child. i am 53 years old and have been married 33 years. all my
    life, my mother told me never to tell my maternal grandmother when our family
    had plans, because she would always "get sick" and spoil everything. for several
    months, my husband and i have been looking forward to a vacation in a cabin in
    the mountains. we have not had one mainly because of the illness and death of
    our son. my mother has scheduled back surgery three days before our vacation.
    she had three choices, but selected that day. she keeps telling me not to cancel
    my vacation, but i know i will pay dearly if i don''t. i will never hear the end
    of it. we really need this time away. my husband cares for his invalid mother
    on a daily basis, and i have a very stressful job. we could use this time to gather
    our wits about us. should i cancel our plans and accept what i know is my responsibility,
    or go ahead and take a vacation and "face the music"? -- torn in kentucky'

    i am furious at "lesson learned in florida," who thought marrying a "relative
    stranger" for the sake of his child was a mistake! how about sleeping with a "relative
    stranger" for the sake of physical pleasure? i guess that part didn''t bother
    him as much. and the divorce was painful and traumatic for him? how about the
    quality of life for a little girl who must struggle with two selfish, irresponsible
    parents who have joint custody? how about the confusion and turmoil of straddling
    two homes? now that will be traumatic for an innocent little victim of his bad
    behavior. for those who haven''t made these foolish and unfortunate mistakes yet,
    take this advice: don''t marry strangers, but don''t sleep with strangers, either.

    speaking as someone who is getting up there in age (today is my 60th birthday),
    i have taken a different tack regarding older people who ramble on or repeat stories
    from their youth. i encourage them and listen to them. there is no reason why
    a topic should be discussed only once. my foremost reason for doing this is because,
    when i reach 70, 80 or 90 (if i''m lucky enough to do so), i hope my friends and
    relatives will be kind enough to be patient with me. it strikes me that the wife
    and friends are not very social. they are unkind and selfish, thinking only of
    themselves. what possible harm can there be in letting older people enjoy themselves
    and spending a few moments paying attention to them? someday they''ll be gone,
    and you will wish you had been kinder, more patient and more caring. -- just my

    you recently printed a letter from someone who implied that there''s something
    wrong with a man in his 40s who is still single. may i offer my opinion? four
    years ago, i married a 38-year-old man who had never been married, never been
    engaged, never lived with anyone and never fathered a child. we had dated for
    almost three years. i was 38 with three children, two still living at home. while
    we were dating, our "dates" generally consisted of attending my children''s sporting
    events, going places with my children, or watching television because it was a
    school night and the kids had to get to bed early. he was an avid hunter, fisherman,
    roper, etc. he did these things on a daily basis and spent his time and money
    on these sports. however, he came to a time in his life when he wanted a family.
    my husband is not perfect; however, he is a devoted husband and father. he is
    completely unselfish with his time and money. we spend 90 percent of our time
    on functions relating to the children, who are teen-agers now. one more thing:
    he was never very popular with the girls or women in this area. that is their
    loss. they were looking on the outside. i looked on the inside and found a man
    who loves unconditionally and buys me beautiful, thoughtful gifts even when working
    10- to 12-hour days. he never raises his voice to me or complains if the housework
    is not completed or if supper is not on the table when he gets home. he also supports
    me in my interests. my husband will tell you that the only thing "wrong" with
    him was that he was waiting for me. -- happily ever after in vinita, okla.'

    for the last 12 years, i have been married to a good man and a great father. i
    have also been friends with a different man i''ll call "sam" for nearly 20 years.
    sam and i have been through a lot together. he helped me through a rough teen-age
    period and my husband''s infidelity. i helped sam through his divorce and his
    affair with a married woman, who happens to be a close friend of mine. my husband
    has never understood how a man and a woman can be "just friends" and never have
    any kind of sexual contact. but to me, sam has been like a big brother. i have
    always defended my relationship with him by saying neither of us has those kinds
    of feelings for each other. i believed that until recently, when sam said something
    to me that makes me think he does. we were discussing the married friend he had
    an affair with, and he mentioned that she had asked him if we ever had sex. he
    said, "no, we never did -- but i wouldn''t mind if we did." he then asked me if
    i ever had those feelings for him. i told him, "no, that would ruin a good friendship."
    my problem now is defending my friendship with sam, knowing he does have those
    feelings for me. i used to be comfortable around him -- like a buddy -- but now
    i''m uneasy. i don''t want to lose his friendship, but i''m not sure i can talk
    to him the same way. it''s almost like i did have an affair with him. if my hubby
    even suspected sam had these feelings for me, he would insist the relationship
    cease. abby, you''re the only person i can confide in. what do i do now? -- innocent

    in a response to a recent letter you stated that you had received more than 100
    requests to print the 15 warning signs of an abusive partner. those warning signs
    are an excellent indicator of someone who is abusive. anyone in a relationship
    with such a person would be more than justified in leaving. what i find interesting,
    however, is that nobody has given any advice to children who are also the victims
    of such an abuser. while adults can sever a relationship with an abuser by leaving,
    a child cannot. the children usually rely on the abuser for the material necessities
    like food, clothing and shelter -- and this often gives the abuser even more control
    over the children. i would like to know what advice you and your readers have
    for children who are suffering in such a relationship. i would also like to hear
    from adults who survived such an abuser. how did they do it? -- concerned in pennsylvania'

    last summer when our son was 13 months old, we visited my in-laws in another state.
    while there, we went out to their lake place, where they keep an older, somewhat
    rundown boat. after dinner, my father-in-law, who had consumed a couple of beers,
    wanted us all to hop in the boat and go for a spin around the lake. since there
    was no infant life jacket available (the type with a special neck support that
    is meant to keep an infant''s head above water), i refused. my father-in-law became
    infuriated and proceeded to berate me because none of the other daughters-in-law
    with small children had a problem with taking their kids in the boat without life
    jackets. my husband supported my position; however, since then my father-in-law
    has been rude and condescending toward me. given the fact that this man had a
    couple of drinks and the boat is old, i just didn''t want to take any chances.

    have counseled her (had she asked me) to have her baby, but if she had chosen

    another holiday is approaching, and the same old question is echoing across the
    country: what to buy for mother''s day? the "usual" gifts, such as flowers, sunday
    brunch and a card, are nice. yet these gifts are common. let me suggest another
    option: the gift of a healthier life. breast cancer is the second-leading cause
    of cancer death in women in the united states. what most people don''t realize
    is the risk of getting breast cancer increases with age. by age 40, chances are
    1 in 217; by age 80, chances are 1 in 10. research shows that older women do not
    recognize that the greatest risk factor for breast cancer is advancing age --
    greater than family history. these are scary facts. the good news is that if detected
    early, breast cancer mortality can be reduced by 20 percent to 40 percent for
    women age 50 and older. this means that even if your mother or grandmother gets
    breast cancer and the cancer is detected early, she is likely to survive it. here''s
    the gift idea: help your mother or grandmother get a mammogram! medicare covers
    annual mammograms for women who are enrolled. all that is owed by the patient
    is the 20 percent co-payment. that''s where you come in. put an "iou" in her mother''s
    day card, or even take her to the doctor''s office or local mammography center
    and pay the balance -- usually between $15 and $25. the message you''ll be giving
    to your mothers and grandmothers is that you love them, and want them to stay
    healthy in their golden years -- and having an annual mammogram is a good way
    to accomplish this. for more information, your readers can call 1-800-medicare

    was, and that engendered confidence in his ability to treat my aunt. however,
    when she hobbled into the receptionist''s office, the door was left open, and
    everyone in the waiting room could hear the answers to all the personal questions.
    nothing was secret from the captive audience. she tried talking softly, but the
    receptionist repeated her answers loudly enough that we could all hear them. abby,
    medical information is supposed to be confidential. had one of the patients demanded
    that kind of information from the receptionist, she probably would have refused
    to answer. because it was for medical records, my aunt felt compelled to answer
    the questions she was asked. it not only embarrassed her, it also put her in a
    vulnerable position for identity theft. shouldn''t medical office personnel be
    more careful to guard the confidential information of the patients? -- nettled

    having read the letter from "hank in tacoma" -- who was upset because his sister-in-law
    had urged his brother "eric" into therapy and freed him from years of servitude
    to his family -- i must admit i was surprised that you didn''t let hank and the
    rest of the family have it! apparently hank feels it is eric''s wife''s fault
    that his brother has found his backbone. how dare hank and the family make judgments
    about eric''s wife without even taking eric up on his offer to join him in counseling
    sessions to learn more about the changes that are taking place. finally, how dare
    eric put his children and wife first? why, abby, if more spouses put their significant
    other and children first, perhaps we would have fewer divorces and happier families

    in today''s paper i read the letter from "hank in tacoma," and i recognize his

    would you be willing to inform your readers of the publication of a book of importance
    to every one of us -- jessica mitford''s "the american way of death revisited"?
    this book, a revised edition of a 1963 version, does a tremendous service in informing
    americans about the wretched excesses of the funeral industry, into whose hands
    we all must ultimately fall. it describes in detail the means employed by that
    industry to separate us from our money just at a point when, through the sorrow
    and confusion attendant upon a death in the family, we are least prepared to think
    clearly. mitford''s book -- which is eminently readable -- is available in a paperback
    edition for just $14. every family should have access to it. every minister should
    read and act upon it. every retirement home, church and synagogue library should
    keep a copy available to loan out to its members. preplanning (but not prepayment!)
    for funeral needs, based on the sort of information ms. mitford presents, is something
    every american family should do as soon as possible. -- john b. gabel, dublin,

    after reading about oscar ortiz, the veteran who was appreciated after 55 years,
    i''m moved to write about the few seconds of appreciation i, a retired teacher,
    received while stopped at a busy intersection waiting for the traffic light to
    turn green. a car filled with large, handsome, very noisy males drove alongside
    me and stopped. i glanced over at them and smiled. one of the young men said,
    "don''t worry -- we''re listening to michael jackson''s ''scream.''" i replied,
    "sounds normal to me after teaching high school for 30 years." the driver did
    a double take and said, "where did you teach?" "westminster high school," i answered.
    he then said, "mrs. p. -- is that you?" when i nodded affirmatively, he said:
    "i never told you before, but i loved you. you were the best teacher i ever had
    in all my years in school." then i recognized him. i said, "sean, i remember when
    you brought your 18-month-old son to my class, and i gave him toys to play with
    while you studied." sean said, "look in the back seat, because there he is. he''s
    almost 16 now." the traffic light changed and our cars started moving into the
    intersection. the last i saw of my former student, he was waving at me and shouting,
    "always remember, mrs. p., i love you!" i''ve been on cloud nine since those few
    seconds at the intersection. i hope this story might prompt students everywhere
    to communicate with those teachers who somehow influenced their lives. dedicated
    teachers need appreciation. a few seconds will do -- but more is always appreciated.

    i''d like to comment on the letter from "overwhelmed in kentucky." she''s the
    woman who married the widower whose grown "children" come to visit every six weeks.
    i assume no grandchildren are coming to visit, since none were mentioned, which
    makes it even easier to resolve her dilemma. "overwhelmed" needs to set some ground
    rules for visiting children. she could offer to fix breakfast each morning and
    let the children be responsible for the other meals. if the girls can''t cook,
    how do they eat when they are not visiting their father? do their husbands cook?
    they can always have lunch and dinner carry-out, or dine in at any neighboring
    restaurant -- splitting the bill, of course. and who ever heard of the hostess
    doing laundry for her guests? my children were taught how to do their own laundry
    when they were old enough to reach the controls on the washer and dryer. as for
    "overwhelmed" cleaning up after they are gone, that''s ridiculous! what''s wrong
    with the married children cleaning up after themselves -- changing bed linens
    to prepare for their next visit, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms they used and
    any other area of the house that they visited? if "overwhelmed''s" husband has
    a problem with these ground rules, then i would recommend she follow your advice
    for an occasional weekend with friends to coincide with his children''s visits.
    if she has to resort to leaving, i would hope that the company would leave the
    house as clean as they found it. -- amazed in arizona'

    may i add a few thoughts regarding the letter from "daughter of a patient," who
    wrote to stress her concerns about health-care workers and hand-washing? i strongly
    confirm that health-care workers need to demonstrate frequent and proper hand-washing
    techniques. gloves are required while performing invasive procedures such as starting
    an iv, drawing blood, changing a dressing, etc. but please do not assume that
    hand-washing did not occur if it was not done in the patient''s visual field.
    i have been an rn for more than 20 years. i wash my hands before and after patient
    contact -- always, without fail. our institution does not allow us to use a patient''s
    bathroom for our routine hygiene (unless our hands become soiled while in contact
    with that patient). nurses, physicians and other health-care personnel in direct
    contact with patients generally use a central hand-washing area, such as in a
    nurse''s station. in this case, patients and their families may never actually
    observe personnel washing their hands -- even though they have. however, if a
    patient or family member actually sees a health-care worker going from one area
    to the next, one patient to the next and having direct skin contact with that
    patient, i suggest they report it immediately to the unit manager. a health-care
    worker is more likely to acquire an infectious disease from the public than the
    other way around. that''s now twice the reason to observe good hand-washing techniques.

    my husband and i are the parents of three college-age children, all of whom drive

    the town we live in has been designated a high-crime area by the county police,
    so it is not uncommon to see cars pulled over, not only for minor traffic violations,
    but also for "suspicious" behavior. my concern as a parent is that most young
    people don''t know how to act if they are stopped by police. of course, they are
    expected to answer all questions respectfully. however, do they know that if they
    reach into their pockets for a license or identification, they might be perceived
    as reaching for a weapon? shouldn''t they learn this in school as part of a health
    and safety course? recently my children and a few friends were relating experiences
    of being stopped by the police. i was appalled to hear about some of the encounters
    these kids have had. my sons and their friends were grabbed from a vehicle, thrown
    up against the car and searched, just because the driver had started to reach
    for his wallet. my daughter was yelled at and ridiculed because she began trembling,
    and then was told she was in "no condition" to drive and must contact a parent.

    stupid and careless. i''m afraid he will not love me anymore and will leave me.
    we have two boys, and it costs a lot to raise a family these days, what with groceries,
    personal items and clothing. i try to make everyone happy, and it''s killing me.
    what''s ironic is that my husband thinks i''m a good money manager. i shop with

    deceiving him. my problem: we are approximately $17,000 in credit card debt. my
    husband is unaware of our financial situation. there is also a $3,000 loan that
    he does know about. he thinks $50 is a lot of money, so how do i begin to tell
    him we owe $17,000? hiding payments to the credit card companies is so stressful.
    the funny thing is, i didn''t spend any of the money on stupid stuff. the gas
    cards are used because once everything else is paid, there''s no money left for
    gas for the vehicles. then there are family birthdays, special occasions, etc.
    -- and no cash for that -- so i use the store credit cards. the visa is mostly
    for cash advances to pay for groceries or to supplement a checking account that
    has gotten too low. i think, "i''ll pay this all off soon and he''ll never know."

    i think i''m losing my sanity -- or am i being extremely sensitive? my husband
    of nine months and i were having a discussion recently regarding a newspaper article
    we had read about a man who drowned trying to save his wife in the ocean. unable
    to swim, he dove in, trying to save the life of his love, and they both drowned.
    i foolishly asked my husband if he would try to save me if i was drowning, and
    got a very unexpected response. he told me that if it appeared that both of us
    would drown, he would not jump in to save me. we have one child together, and
    he is the stepfather to my three children. when i asked him if he''d jump in to
    try to save his infant son, he immediately replied, "yes." when i asked him to
    explain why he wouldn''t die trying to save the love of his life, he stated that
    in all lifesaving classes, people are taught to evaluate the situation (i.e.,
    make sure the rescuer wouldn''t also die) before trying to save another life.
    i''m sorry, but i would die trying to save my four children or him, for that matter,
    even if i had less than a 1 percent chance of living through the ordeal. i wouldn''t
    be able to live with myself if i didn''t at least try to save a loved one. please
    tell me i''m not crazy. maybe i''m just a hopeless romantic, but something seems
    very wrong here. -- hurting heart'

    my question concerns two stray cats, one male, one female, who appeared at my
    back door within the last year or so. both are somewhat timid, but look as though
    they are in good health, aside from being very hungry. they don''t bother my other
    cats, and it''s no problem for me to feed and shelter them. here''s the problem:
    neither of these animals has been "fixed." i have made numerous attempts to find
    the owners, with newspaper ads and walking the neighborhood, but no one has come
    forward. i would like to take them both to the vet, but since i''m not sure there
    is an owner, i don''t know if this is the "proper" thing to do. i hate to think

    neglect, but do i have the right to do this to an animal that isn''t really mine?

    mr. robertson, the president of 1-hour photo corp., made a very good point about
    backing up priceless family images with film negatives. what he neglected to say
    was that color prints, even properly stored, have a life expectancy far less than
    that of one human generation. the solution? black and white, of course. black-and-white
    images, when printed on high-quality black-and-white photographic paper and developed
    properly, should last approximately 200 years. but i must caution your readers:
    do not be taken in by processors who would tell you, "black and white is black
    and white." not so! some developers are now printing black-and-white images on
    color photographic paper. those images will fade as quickly as if they were printed
    from a color negative. of course, you should shoot the colorful balloons at your
    baby''s first birthday party in color. but please take some black-and-white pictures,
    too. in a few years, the frosting on the birthday cake is going to look moldy
    in those color prints. when you must use color, nothing can beat slides. prints
    can be made from them for albums, but the brilliantly projected image on a screen
    can''t compare with passing around a 4-by-6-inch piece of paper. "monochrome"
    images can be oil-tinted, sepia-toned or left alone. but one thing is for sure:
    no matter the race of your family, the faces of your grandparents will never turn

    wearing a bra. the girls began to make fun of me, telling me that only lesbians
    go braless. (it doesn''t help that i currently have a boyfriend.) now word has

    of me, from boys pretending to unsnap my nonexistent bra to a girl actually coming
    on to me thinking i was really gay. my mom says she was lucky; going braless was

    eventually stop. having gone without a bra this long, i don''t want to go back

    again the other morning the news was about the terrible losses from a tornado
    striking in the middle of the night -- this time in south georgia. could you please
    tell people about weather-warning radios? sadly, they seem to be a well-kept secret.
    after tornadoes struck at night in other states last year, i bought weather radios
    for each of my children''s homes and for myself. they''re relatively inexpensive
    ($30 to $60) and can be tucked in a corner, out of the way. what they do is respond
    to a radio signal from the noaa (national oceanic and atmospheric administration)
    when dangerous weather is imminent. the signal turns on the radio to alert people.
    the radio at our house is in the hallway outside our bedrooms. it''s tuned to
    the nearest weather station, with the volume up all the way. at 2:30 a.m. on the
    night the storm hit georgia, we were awakened by the signal and the warning of
    a potentially dangerous storm. luckily, we had only torrential rain and some tree-trimming
    wind. at least we knew what was happening and could have made it to the basement
    if things had gotten worse. we are blessed with attentive weather people on television
    and at noaa who notify us of impending storms. however, at night there is no better
    way to learn of impending bad weather than from a weather radio. i''d rather be
    awakened for a storm that doesn''t turn bad than chance what happened to those
    poor folks in georgia. thanks, abby, for giving me a forum. i hope you''ll consider
    this letter worth printing. -- janet h. mahannah, gastonia, n.c.'

    your advice to "shirley b. from roswell, n.m." about how a woman should change
    her name when she marries was good information -- but presented only half the
    equation. there are many of us men who choose to hyphenate our last names with
    those of our wives. as a married couple, we share our money, our home, our bed,
    our hearts and souls -- why not our names? for me, it was a matter of practicality.
    we both wanted to have the same last name and saw no reason why we shouldn''t.
    also, by using both names, our children could have the last name of both of us.
    after my family''s initial shock (which they quickly got over), the only problem
    i''ve encountered is that it''s a bit awkward filling out forms with my "maiden
    name." -- daniel sapon-borson, a happy hyphenated husband in portland dear daniel:
    if this idea takes hold, creators of forms will have to change the designation

    since ours was the only listing in the phone directory under our unusual last

    husband answered -- and he finally began to look askance at me! one morning before
    i left for work, i received a call from a collection agent demanding payment on

    and found our number listed to that woman''s name. her address? smack dab in the

    my mother and i have been discussing the proper way to address an envelope to
    a divorced lady. i have been divorced for several years and am on very good terms
    with my ex-husband and his wife. last year, my aunt sent me a christmas card to
    "mrs. albert jones." it was ironic that it arrived on a day when my ex and his
    wife were at my house. i looked at my ex''s wife and said, "this must be for you!"
    knowing my aunt, we all laughed about it. i spoke with my mother and asked her
    to tell her sister not to address me in that manner. i am divorced from albert
    and am no longer his wife. (as a matter of fact, mrs. albert jones does exist
    -- and it''s not me!!) this year, my aunt has at least improved a bit. she sent
    my christmas card to "mrs. tina smith." i again spoke with my mother and told
    her that since i have been divorced for several years, i do not consider myself
    a "mrs." my mother replied that it is still proper to address a divorced woman
    as "mrs." i do not believe this is correct. i explained to my mother that in the
    case of a death, the wife could continue to use her husband''s name -- but not
    in the case of a divorce. which one of us is right, abby? -- tina in orlando,

    i am writing in response to the reply you gave the young woman signed "scared

    her parents claimed they would disown her if she became pregnant before age 24.
    they also expect her to repay the money they spent on her college education. your
    response for her to be responsible and begin paying back the money is ludicrous!
    parents should not manipulate an adult daughter to do exactly as they want her
    to. life has many twists and turns. it does not always follow a script that the
    parents have laid out. her parents were willing to pay for her education in the
    beginning. was there a signed contract stating she could not marry before her
    degree was acquired? the parents should realize that a marriage and expected child
    need not be the end of the road for their daughter''s formal education. eventually
    she will probably decide to continue it. she and her husband will have enough
    expenses to worry about without this silly demand from her parents. how controlling
    and manipulative can parents be to dictate they will disown their daughter if
    she gets pregnant before they think she should? her parents deserve a kick in

    i am now in my third year of marriage to my husband. we have a daughter who is
    a year old. unfortunately, it has become painfully clear that we do not have even
    one interest in common. my husband could survive to the end of his days with a
    bed, a computer, a television and a vcr. i have accepted the fact that this man
    will never take the world by storm because of his complete lack of ambition. what
    i can no longer accept is that he has no respect for anyone. he seems to lack
    a fundamental concern, compassion and respect for other human beings. on top of
    this, he is sneaky. his work ethic is low, and he categorizes people who enjoy
    their work as "workaholics who work and one day die." he lacks passion, has no
    hobbies outside of tv and computers, and could not be less enthused about life.
    during the holidays, my mom kills herself to lay out a spread that makes the ritz
    pale by comparison, and each year my husband shows up in jeans and a sweatshirt.
    when i ask him each year to please pack something nice, he gets an attitude. the
    kicker is that she tries hard each time he is coming to prepare the things he
    likes. he treats his own mother the same way. she laughs it off and seems to take
    his lack of manners in stride. is there any hope of changing someone who doesn''t

    not long ago i began seeing a man who seemed to be the most caring, generous person.
    the relationship moved quickly, and we began to discuss moving in together. friends
    expressed concern about the speed of events, but i felt it was love at first sight.
    this in itself was exciting, as i have always been a bit overweight and this nice-looking
    man was showing a great deal of interest in me. a few things kept this from being
    absolutely perfect: he owned few possessions other than clothes, he was living
    with a relative at no cost, he didn''t own a vehicle, he was having to spend quite
    a bit of time in court, and he drank a bit more than i normally felt comfortable
    with. he attributed all of this to his ex-fiance, who, he explained, had set him
    up on false charges. (i had offered to accompany him to court for moral support,
    but he didn''t want me exposed to this "vicious woman.") i believed him because
    what would this sweet man possibly have done to deserve any of what he had gone
    through? it also would have meant that i wasn''t as desirable as i had been feeling
    lately. had someone told me what i heard for myself, i would never have believed
    him capable of such ruthlessness. one evening, i overheard him tell a "bar buddy"
    that he was looking at some serious jail time, and he needed someone to make deposits
    into his jail account and to visit him. he also commented that he didn''t have
    a lot of time and he couldn''t be as selective as he would like. i was devastated
    -- for what did that say about me? i have been blessed with some very understanding
    friends and a great counselor. let me share with you what i have found: 1. it
    says nothing about me. it says he was a creep, the kind few of us can relate to
    or comprehend. 2. quick involvement is a red flag for potential problems -- possibly
    even abuse. 3. anyone can file a complaint against someone, but the police have
    to have a good reason to arrest someone on that complaint. with the person''s
    name and birthdate, you can get information concerning that person''s arrest record
    and, in most non-felony cases, you may even be able to get a police report. (i
    discovered that two of the incidents occurred while we were seeing each other,
    and one he even admitted to the police.) this man chose me because of my lack
    of self-esteem. the most important thing people -- especially women -- need to
    work toward is knowing what we are worth and not accepting less. it will make
    us far less vulnerable to con men such as the one with whom i was involved. --

    i have a different kind of problem for you. my husband, "bill," is a smoker, and
    i''m a nonsmoker. he knows that his habit is bad for him and has expressed his
    desire to quit on countless occasions. he has tried to quit a few times without
    success. here''s my problem. my mother-in-law, "mary" (also a smoker), gives bill
    packs of cigarettes as gifts. i told bill long ago that i understand his addiction
    (i used to smoke years ago), but that he should never ask me to buy cigarettes
    for him because i cannot in good conscience assist him in destroying his health.
    i know that mary is a grown woman and it is not my place to tell her what she
    can and cannot do for her only son, but i want to scream every time i see her
    handing bill a pack of cigarettes and saying, "here, sweetie, i got these for
    you." i feel like i''m watching someone slowly kill him. yes, i realize that the
    ultimate responsibility lies with bill because he''s the one who lights the cigarettes
    and inhales the smoke, but what mental deficiency must mary have to, in effect,
    kill her own son? is there anything i can do to get her to stop giving him cigarettes?
    bill would never ask her to stop because his take on the situation is that he''s
    going to smoke anyway -- and cigarettes are expensive -- so she''s doing us both
    a favor and saving us some money. by the way, mary is a serious control freak,
    and the last time bill and i attempted to speak with her about something that
    was very important, she didn''t speak to us for a year, which hurt bill immeasurably.

    in their home. i believe they have visitation one day a weekend or every other
    weekend. when sending christmas gifts or birthday party invitations to her biological
    daughter, should the same be done for her stepdaughter -- even if some of her
    friends have not met her stepdaughter yet because of her infrequent visitation?

    i have a sensitive problem i don''t know how to handle. i have a sister-in-law
    i would do anything for. i love her as i would a sister. she is my best friend,
    but her husband is a total jerk. he has been making advances toward me and saying
    things like, "i wish you were mine," and, "a lot of women think i''m great and
    would be happy to have me." my sister-in-law invites me to their house frequently,

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a first-time mother of a beautiful 18-month-old son. my mother is crazy about
    being a grandma and begs me to come for extended visits so she can get to know
    her grandson. i just returned from a week''s visit -- and i am exhausted. why?
    because mother refuses to "baby-proof" her house for our visits, so i spend all
    my time watching my son to ensure that he doesn''t break something valuable, or
    get into the bleach under the kitchen sink. every baby book you buy stresses the
    importance of baby-proofing during the toddler years, so here are a few suggestions
    i have for grandparents who want their grandchildren to have a safe visit: 1.
    move all cleaning supplies, cosmetics and room deodorizers up to a high shelf
    or cupboard. 2. invest in outlet covers and drawer and cupboard locks. they are
    inexpensive and easy to remove after visits. 3. put away all hard candies, coins,
    glass-framed photos, candles, and anything of sentimental value before your grandchild
    arrives. 4. plants, animal litter boxes, pet food, detergents and caustic chemicals
    should be out of reach and out of sight. 5. sharp-edged furniture, such as coffee
    tables or end tables, should have easily installed corner protectors applied,
    or should be turned on their sides during visits. one of my girlfriends told me
    that when she''s coming for a visit, her mother buys diapers, baby wipes and appropriate
    baby food. she also has bibs, baby cups and spoons on hand. she even buys age-appropriate
    toys to keep at her house so her granddaughter has special toys to look forward
    to playing with during the visit. in most cases, it''s been about 20 years since
    these grandparents have been around babies. i think if they would read a current
    baby/toddler book, they would be surprised to learn about the new information
    available. -- bent out of shape in bend, ore.'

    one woman, however, is constantly challenging, questioning and putting me down
    personally and professionally. she ridicules my opinions in planning meetings,
    implies i''m making things up in all sorts of situations, and argues with everything
    i do and say, even if it is not her business. she spends large amounts of time
    on personal phone calls, which interrupt my concentration, and mocks me for not

    he has given us many things, including a beautiful home -- which ruby doesn''t
    have. among other things, she calls him a "male chauvinist." it happens almost

    our home," and assumes she''s always welcome. i''m sure it would be a rude awakening
    for ruby to discover she isn''t exactly my best friend. why is it that people
    today think everyone is their friend, and they can just stay in your home because
    it''s on the way to somewhere? sometimes i think they stay here not so much because
    they like our home, but to avoid paying for a motel. by the way, i haven''t exactly

    i read the complimentary letter from karl southward to the head of sanitation
    for the city of dallas. why would you want to file a letter such as that? my suggestion
    would be to frame that letter and display it on a wall the majority of workers
    pass, so they can continually be reminded that a compliment was passed on to them.
    i might even go a step further and photocopy the letter and insert it with each
    employee''s paycheck, adding a note saying, "good job, everyone." you''d be amazed
    how the morale of the employees would pick up. i personally send complimentary
    letters. it''s part of my daily "practice random acts of kindness" mission. kudos

    yesterday my husband had surgery to remove a lump. the doctor prepared us for
    the worst, indicating that it might be cancer. my husband told only close family
    members and a few friends about his condition. his sister, "winifred," traveled
    150 miles to come to the hospital, even though she was told there was no need
    for her to be there. i was very upset with her presence. i wanted some private
    time with my husband in the pre-op room, but within minutes, winifred ushered
    herself in. i became upset and told her so. however, she refused to go back to
    the public waiting room. while in the waiting room, during my husband''s surgery,
    winifred asked me if i would like to "talk about" the way i was acting. i told
    her i had wanted private time with my husband. she said i was selfish, that she
    is dearly fond of her brother. abby, in the nine years we''ve owned our home,

    my husband and i have been married 34 years. we are both 53. for the last few
    years, our marriage has been strained, but we have never cheated on each other
    that i''m aware of. now my husband is doing something i''m afraid spells trouble.
    a few months ago he started "helping" his female hairdresser learn how to use
    her computer at her house, which is close to ours. then he decided he should "help
    her" buy a printer by taking the weekly sales ads from the sunday paper to her
    house every monday night. i knew nothing about it for the first couple of months.
    it just "slipped out" one night. i thought he was working a lot of overtime on
    mondays, and now he''s consistently two hours late -- but only on monday nights.
    when i told my husband i thought seeing her could lead to something more than
    business, he agreed. but he swears he only wants to help her because he admires
    her for raising her 10-year-old son alone, and she needs his help. he estimates
    it might take one and a half to two years to find her the right printer. i say
    that''s hogwash. i doubt that she''s even looking -- for a printer, that is. i
    think she''s looking for a man, because she has no boyfriend and is very short
    on money. i don''t want to push him into doing anything if this is innocent, but
    i also don''t want to be a fool and get dumped in the end. i have stuck with this
    marriage through a lot of turmoil, and i think i deserve some loyalty. what do

    my ten commandments of love. yes, dear readers, i actually had the chutzpah to
    write my own ten commandments. however, it wasn''t as though i was stealing from
    strangers. one of my ancestors was privileged to have received them on mount sinai
    from the lord himself -- at least that''s what the good book says. originally,
    i wrote two sets of commandments -- one for men and one for women. then mandy
    stellman, a lawyer from milwaukee, pointed out that one set of commandments should
    apply to both men and women. she was right, of course. so how''s this for a gender-bender?
    the ten commandments of love -- put your spouse before your mother, your father,
    your son and your daughter -- your mate is your lifelong companion. -- do not
    abuse your body with excessive food, tobacco, drink, or any foreign substance
    that goes into your arm or up your nose. -- remember that cleanliness is a virtue.
    -- willingly share all of your worldly goods with your mate. -- do not forget
    to say, "i love you." even though your love may be constant, your spouse needs
    to hear those cherished words often. -- remember that the approval of your spouse
    is worth far more than the adoring glances of a hundred strangers, so be true
    to him or her, and forsake all others. -- permit neither your business nor your
    hobby to make you a stranger to your spouse. the most precious gift you can give
    is time. -- keep your home in good repair, because out of it come the joys of
    old age (not to mention its resale value). -- forgive with grace, because who
    among us does not need to be forgiven? -- honor the lord your god every day of
    your life, and your children will grow up to bless you. today, be a sweetheart.
    call someone you love and say, "i love you." (make two or three calls; who says
    you can''t love more than one person -- in different ways, of course.) call someone
    who''s lonely and say, "i''m thinking of you." or better yet, say, "i''ll be over
    tomorrow to take you to lunch, run some errands for you or give you a ride." visit
    a sick friend. say a prayer. donate some blood. adopt a pet. will your eyes, your
    kidneys and all your usable organs to someone who can use them after you''re gone.
    forgive an enemy. hug your teen-ager. write a fan letter. listen to a bore. pay
    your doctor. tell your parents you think they''re wonderful. spay your dog. neuter
    your cat. quit smoking. drive carefully. if you''re walking -- watch where you''re
    going. and don''t wait until next year to be a sweetheart again. -- love, abby'

    your advice to "sis, the nag" from hickory hills, ill., was right on target. the
    woman is a primary candidate for retirement living. unfortunately, society as
    a whole, and especially the maturing adult, is undereducated when it comes to
    the resources available to them and the many advantages of those resources. a
    large part of the american culture continues to perceive retirement living in
    the same vein as life in a nursing home -- hence the hesitation when it comes
    to this type of decision making. although life in a retirement community is quite
    the contrary, this perception has been slow to change. i work in a continuing
    care retirement community (ccrc). the beauty of this environment is that there
    are 60-, 70-, 80- and 90-year-old adults who continue to live active and independent
    lives, and yet have assisted and nursing care services available to them in the
    event these needs arise. the residents reside in a hotel-like atmosphere in their
    own apartments, with their own furniture, go to the mall, grocery stores, theater
    and anywhere else they so desire. they make new friends that have had or continue
    to have similar life experiences. today''s senior has worked hard to provide children
    and grandchildren with the opportunity and vision to fulfill their own goals.
    the families want only the very best for them. they want their parents to enjoy
    themselves and all of the amenities they so often deprived themselves of to provide
    for their families. retirement living is truly a step in the right direction.
    "sis" is no doubt facing a difficult decision. regardless of how nice the retirement
    community is, it will never be the memory-filled home in which she raised her
    family. however, life is a series of trade-offs. she is already feeling the burden
    of caring for her house and at a loss as to why her children are not more available.
    "sis" probably has a delightful brood, but what will she expect of them if her
    health declines and she finds herself able to handle less and less? taking this
    first step is a big one. i meet people daily who are hesitant to take the initial
    step. the majority of mature adults feel they are not ready for retirement living.
    yet these same folks come into my office six months after they''ve moved in to
    tell me how happy they are, and how they wish they had made the move years earlier.

    a wonderful way to remember those who go before us. at a particularly frustrating

    i was pleased to read in your column about men who behave like gentlemen. may
    i share my "gentleman" story? when i leave his house, he always walks me out to
    the car. he opens the car door for me and then gently hands me my seatbelt as
    a reminder. when we arrive at our destination, he jumps out of the car and races
    around to open my door for me. and he always places his hand under mine to keep
    me from falling. i have heard women ask their escorts, boyfriends and husbands
    why they can''t be more like him. they smile at my gentleman and tell him they
    wish they were with him. my gentleman is my 10-year-old grandson, who is as rough-and-tumble

    remember the letter in your column about the teacher who asked students to write
    compliments to one another, and then passed them along to each individual? well,
    abby, i used her idea -- with wonderful results! i work in "chaya," a prison ministry
    for incarcerated youth in arizona. last year, two weeks before valentine''s day,
    i gave a talk on love and respect for one another to 25 girls between the ages
    of 12 and 18. afterward, i passed out paper and pencils to the girls and instructed
    them to write a compliment for each girl -- and to say nothing if they didn''t
    have anything nice to say. i told them not to sign their names, as all compliments
    should be given out of love, not the hope of being thanked. nearly all the girls
    complimented every other girl. i took the papers home that night and typed a list
    of compliments for each girl. i deleted anything negative or questionable, including
    the few slang terms with which i was unfamiliar. i cut out 25 large red hearts
    and pasted a compliment list to the back of each one. my children decorated the
    front with doilies, stickers, pictures and lace. i distributed the hearts to the
    girls at the valentine party we hosted. i asked each girl to read her compliments
    to herself and then to share the one compliment that meant the most to her, and
    the one that surprised her the most. it was a meaningful experience, especially
    for these troubled girls who have had little or no affection or positive affirmation
    in their lives. the girls told me how much they cherished these hearts, and the
    staff allowed them to be hung on their walls -- which was a great privilege for
    them. abby, i would like to thank the person who came up with that idea, and you
    for printing it. it took some work on my part to make sure no one was hurt by
    insults, but that was a responsibility i enjoyed because i got to read all the
    outpouring of love. -- lita johnson, phoenix'

  subject: Minority Organ Donors Are Encouraged to Stay Healthy
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    for many years, there has been much discussion about the need for more organ/tissue
    donors. the death of the chicago bears football great walter payton, who had a
    rare liver disease that could have been treated if an organ had been found and
    a liver transplant performed early on, should heighten awareness. with this particular
    disease, if an organ is not found and a liver transplant is not performed, the
    disease can result in cancer, at which time a person cannot receive a transplant.
    with new names being added to the national waiting list and 12 people dying each
    day waiting for an organ transplant, will there ever be enough organs to help
    those who need them? the national minority organ tissue transplant education program
    (mottep) has taken a different approach to help with this problem. first, we educate
    communities about the diseases and lifestyles that cause people to need transplants
    in the first place. this includes high blood pressure, diabetes, not eating healthy
    meals, drinking alcohol, using drugs and not going to the doctor at least once
    a year for a checkup. if people adopted healthier lifestyles, the number of people
    who need a transplant would be fewer. also, when comparing the number of healthy
    organs to the number of unsuitable organs of persons who wish to be donors, it
    is clear that healthier lifestyles would greatly improve the chances for people
    to donate healthy organs. this would ultimately result in more lives being saved.
    in many cities, we offer blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose (for diabetes)
    screenings, and distribute prevention information to encourage people to take
    better care of themselves. second, we show the community that they can be a part
    of the solution by giving them an opportunity to plan and participate in activities
    that help others learn about the importance of organ and tissue donation. also,
    those who have received transplants or donated a loved one''s organs share their
    stories -- because the best way to educate people is to make sure they hear the
    message over and over again. national mottep has programs in 15 cities across
    the country. each program works with schools, faith communities, shopping malls,
    beauty salons, barber shops and other community organizations to educate others
    about the need to become organ and tissue donors. most recently, national mottep
    developed a sports council for transplantation, which is being spearheaded by
    basketball hall of fame member oscar robertson. the purpose of the sports council
    is to gain the support of athletes, coaches and sports journalists to increase
    organ and tissue donations among minorities. national mottep was created to increase
    the number of african americans, hispanics/latinos, asians, pacific islanders,
    native americans and alaska natives who sign donor cards, have family discussions
    and become donors. there are more than 65,000 men, women and children on the national
    transplant waiting list. almost half of them are minorities. it is not only important
    to get more individuals to become organ and tissue donors, it is equally important
    to make sure these same people take care of themselves and live healthier lifestyles
    so they won''t end up on the transplant waiting list. -- clive o. callender, m.d.,
    founder and principal investigator, national mottep'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    usually i do not interject my opinion to total strangers. however, as my wife
    and i were sitting at a table in a mall, there were two women at the next table.
    one of them had with her a screaming infant in a buggy. finally, the mother lifted
    the baby into her arms and began bouncing it around. the baby cried even more,
    so the infant was put back in the buggy with a disgusted thrust as the baby continued
    to scream. i spoke up, saying, "the baby may be thirsty." the mother found a bottle
    full of water and stuck it into the baby''s mouth. the baby not only stopped crying,
    but attacked the water as if its life was dependent upon it. i have heard women
    say about crying babies, "don''t worry -- the baby is just exercising her lungs."
    abby, a baby''s cry is a signal that something is wrong. when a woman first becomes
    pregnant, a nurse in her doctor''s office should instruct her about care for a
    crying baby. when the baby cries: is she thirsty? is he hungry? is the baby wet
    and in need of changing? is she too hot? too cold? are the bed clothes wrapped
    so tightly around the baby or his arms or legs that they are shutting off the
    circulation? (lift the baby completely out of the crib and look things over.)
    the baby might also have an extremity caught in the buggy parts. finally, if it
    is none of the above, the baby might be sick. learn how to take the infant''s
    temperature. if the temperature is above 100 degrees f, take the baby immediately
    to the emergency room unless his or her doctor is willing and able to see the
    infant immediately. -- retired doctor in scottsdale, ariz.'

    the letter from "in limbo in washington" prompted me to write. i, too, was widowed
    suddenly several years ago. because of my strong church upbringing, i mistakenly
    believed that a church would be a safe place to meet stable, good "christian"
    men. wrong! the men i met in church were as fallible as those i met anywhere else.
    i encountered men who were just like those i would have met in any singles club
    or bar every day except sunday, and "barracudas" trolling for victims. the majority
    of them were either retired or unemployed, and looking for a "sugar mama" to support
    them or supplement their income. if they were still unmarried in their 40s, there
    was usually a very good reason for it. one of my friends from church had been
    engaged to a fellow from the group who pestered her for sex prior to their marriage.
    when she finally gave in, he treated her with such disrespect and disgust that
    she ended the relationship -- considering it a valuable lesson learned. i briefly
    dated a fellow who, after my constant questioning about his marital status, finally
    admitted he was only "separated" and was looking for a lady to "help him make
    up his mind" as to whether he wanted to divorce his wife or not! then there was
    the desperate jewelry designer with the ego problem who had more earrings and
    piercings in his ears than i did; the gay man trying to find a woman to marry
    to convince his elderly parents he wasn''t gay; and finally, the fellow who thought
    he was the reincarnation of a 15th-century pope. they were all loyal churchgoers.
    i also met men who thought i would be vulnerable and easy-pickings because i was
    a young widow. they found out differently. so, where did i finally meet my handsome,
    sweet husband? we met at a local dance bar when i was so disgusted i was ready
    to join a convent even though i am not catholic. please, abby, warn single women
    not to automatically assume that all churchgoers are honest, upstanding citizens.
    they are human, just like the rest of us. also, tell "limbo" to dump that charming
    -- but still married -- s.o.b. because the minute she''s out of the picture, he''ll

    in 1989, my nephew bryan and his fiancee were killed in an automobile accident.
    he was only 21 years old. my brother-in-law and sister were faced with that dreaded
    question, "is your son an organ donor?" in fact, he was, and had discussed his
    wishes with his parents some time before the accident. as a result of bryan''s
    unselfishness, several people''s pain was ended and their bodies were mended.
    a couple of years later, my sister was asked by a nurse who worked in transplant
    services to speak to a group of medical professionals who deal with organ donation
    and donor families. she was told that they never had a problem getting a recipient
    to come and tell the story from that point of view, but it was rare to find a
    donor mom or dad who would discuss how being approached for donation had affected
    their lives and what it meant to them. those people wanted to know how she felt
    about what took place in that drab little room off to the side of the emergency
    room on the night her son died. they knew they would be faced with asking that
    question again and again, and wanted to know if she could give them a word of
    encouragement or correction to make them better equipped to help the next family.
    how could she refuse? in the days to follow she wrestled with the thought of standing
    in front of a group of strangers and pouring out the horrible story. she decided
    she needed to jot down something that could be read for her in case she fell apart.
    in the space of an hour, the enclosed poem is what god''s grace allowed her to
    express. perhaps you will feel it''s worth sharing with your readers. -- ron belshe,

    the letter from "still laughing in dallas," regarding the whistle and the obscene

    and was often away from home. during those periods i would receive phone calls
    on an irregular basis. it seemed that this person would wait until about 10 minutes
    after i had gone to bed, then call and not say anything. it did not matter what
    time i went to bed. the only thing the police suggested was to change my phone
    number or keep a whistle handy. i decided that the whistle would wake my children
    and might push the caller into something more aggressive. finally, one evening
    i had enough. i told the caller that if he would just speak to me, we could have
    a wonderful conversation. did he know what it was like to be cooped up with two
    kids under the age of 4 for days on end without another adult to converse with?
    changing diapers, cleaning up smeared food all over the table and chairs? i kept
    talking about the children and then i heard a "click." never another phone call.

    i am not normally a person who would write to you, but i am prompted to do so
    as a result of the letter you printed relating to obtaining inheritance tax, estate
    tax or income tax incentives for people to become organ donors. i am a lawyer
    who practices in the estate and tax field, and i thought that the proposition
    was interesting from that standpoint. however, as a registered organ donor, i
    question both the proposition and your support of it. my questioning does not
    concern the need to get more organ donors, but it concerns the motivation of people
    to donate organs in return for tax relief. i am concerned that our society needs
    to have "incentives" to do that which is right. do we really need to have income
    tax deductions to support our favorite charities? do we need tax incentives to
    encourage people to employ persons otherwise unemployable? will charitable giving
    collapse if, for some reason, charitable deductions were eliminated from the internal
    revenue code? i would hope that the answer to these questions would be no, so
    i am not in support of the person who suggests that we give incentives to encourage
    people to become organ donors. the incentive should be that you are doing the

    after reading the letters about obscene phone calls, i thought you might be interested
    in the one i received the summer of my surgery. when i answered the phone i heard
    heavy breathing. then someone with a deep voice said, "i''ve been watching ...
    i''ve been watching you getting undressed every night." i started to laugh because
    i knew it couldn''t be true. i was in a body cast from underarms to hips -- and
    confined to bed for four months! the caller then asked, "what''s so funny?" i
    said: "you''d better get glasses; i''m in a body cast." there was no comment after
    that, just silence on the other end of the phone. that was the end of my one and

    you have helped so many people, i hope you can help me. i have been married more
    than 20 years, and we have two lovely daughters. everything was fine until my
    wife started to work as a secretary for a bank branch manager. when i found out
    they had been having an affair for nearly two years, it crushed me. i asked my
    wife if she wanted a divorce, and she said, "no." i didn''t either for the sake
    of the children and, strange as it sounds, i still loved her. she agreed to quit
    working there, and about the same time the branch manager got transferred to a
    branch in another city, so i thought everything was all right. she then took a
    job as a secretary to an attorney in a law firm. i became suspicious when i would
    call her at the office at 2 or 3 in the afternoon and was told, "she and mr. ''jones''
    went to lunch and then to see a client to take a deposition." a private detective
    discovered that the "deposition" was taking place in a motel! when i confronted
    her, she admitted that she and her boss were having an affair. we saw a counselor
    and our pastor, but my wife insisted it was no big deal and everyone was doing
    it. she still doesn''t want a divorce and assured me it was over as far as her
    cheating goes. she now works in an office with only women, so i''m hopeful her
    cheating is a thing of the past. abby, how do i cope with the second infidelity,
    since it, too, lasted more than a year? i want to save our marriage because of
    the kids. i saw a psychiatrist, but he didn''t help much. any advice, abby? i''m
    really hurting. -- can''t forget in the midwest'

    my late wife and i were married for more than 60 years. my reason for writing
    is to express how shocking it is to find many friends and relatives have given
    me the cold shoulder since my wife''s funeral. i cannot understand why. the isolation
    and sense of loss at a time of life when one needs support and encouragement have
    been hard to cope with. the funeral expenses and the need to curb my activities
    because of the decrease in income are heavy enough changes to absorb, but the
    rejection by people i thought were friends hits even harder. is there a specific
    reason for these cold shoulders and lack of phone calls -- just when the opposite
    is needed? several of these previous "friends" are strong church attendees. i

    you receive many letters from people telling you they are taken advantage of --
    by friends, relatives, neighbors, etc. why don''t these "victims" assert themselves
    and refuse to do that which makes them uncomfortable? the people who drop in unannounced,
    or the out-of-towners who freeload, are not friends. they have their own agendas
    and don''t stop for one second to consider the other person''s feelings. i used
    to have a close friend until she asked me if she could borrow $50,000. her request
    occurred less than three months after my husband was downsized from a corporation
    after 19 years. the friendship was never the same after i had to refuse. my formula
    is simple: choose people who treat you the way you treat them -- with consideration
    and respect. perhaps some people say yes too often because they want the whole
    world to love them, and that''s why they end up frustrated and resentful. people

    -- all the while exploring any and all professional opportunities. we receive
    regular e-mails from him regarding all sorts of fun weekends, rafting trips and
    tennis tournaments. however, his law practice is limping along. he has never been
    married and has no dependents, nor is he disabled in any way. for as long as my
    husband can remember, david has always gotten himself into financial trouble and
    someone in the family has had to bail him out. even in his 30s, david has received
    thousands from one sibling or another or his parents. this is the first time david
    has approached us for money, as my husband is the youngest in the family. though
    it was a difficult decision to make, we determined that we were not doing david
    any favors by sending him money. with david''s history of poor financial management,
    we feel we would just be perpetuating the problem. without lecturing, my husband
    explained our position to his brother. he became obviously upset and ended the
    phone conversation quickly. we no longer receive e-mails from him, and he hasn''t
    spoken to us since. furthermore, the rest of the family is furious with us. abby,
    were we wrong to not send money? -- annabelle'

    "wiser in north texas" made a good suggestion for interacting with the 10-year-old
    boy who didn''t listen to his father. i would like to share a lesson i learned
    from my mother 50 years ago. my son was a very active toddler, and i didn''t realize
    i was yelling at him until the day my mom was visiting me. she quietly said to
    me: "honey, if you yell at children, they stop hearing you. if you speak very
    softly but firmly, they will stop to listen to you." my son was my first child.
    i later had four daughters, and mom''s advice worked with all of them. it is still
    working for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. my own advice to mothers
    is this: when you are the most frazzled and frustrated, take the time to imagine
    yourself as your child -- on the receiving end of your words, and looking up at
    your angry face. then ask yourself, "is this what my child needs from me?" --

    i am a working mother who just had a baby last june. fortunately, everything is
    going great. she is healthy and happy, my husband and i are doing well, and the
    proud grandparents baby-sit for our newborn. i have gotten right back into shape.
    i swim 40 laps every day, eat very healthfully and happily fit into a size 4 again.
    (actually, the pants i''m wearing right now are a size 2!) my problem is this:
    since my job is laid-back and does not require a dress code -- web development,
    sitting behind a pc all day -- i seem to dress very poorly each day. sometimes
    i look at myself in the mirror and say, "for someone who takes such good care
    of her body, eats so well and stays in shape -- you look like a slob!" please,
    abby, help me devote more time to myself. although going to the gym during lunch
    is a priority and eating healthfully goes without saying, i let my hair look like
    a complete mess, my clothes never match, i wear old sneakers every day, and my
    shirts are wrinkled and three sizes too big. what can i do to look neater and
    actually make it a priority every day? -- "l" in middle village, n.y.'
