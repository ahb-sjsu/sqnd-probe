    caring. so, what''s the problem? i don''t know which one to choose. i know many

    me. well, i have found out, and it''s no picnic. i have to choose between them
    soon. they both have agreed to accept my decision. i have spent many sleepless

    i am the mother of twin boys. i have learned that going places with twins is a

    admiring and inquisitive people. all that attention can be fun-unless you''re
    in a hurry to get somewhere. it really became annoying when the twins were in
    twin strollers. i wish i had a dollar for each time i was asked the following
    questions: are they twins? (yes.) how old are they? (11 months.) what are their
    names? (jonathan and donovan.) how much do they weigh? (about 17 pounds each.)
    how much did they weigh when they were born? (2 pounds 14 ounces.) are they identical?
    (no, but occasionally, i get them mixed up.) do twins run in your family? (they
    do now.) i''ll bet they sure keep you busy! (yes, they certainly do.) then i add,
    "please don''t pinch their cheeks or touch their hands. they were almost three
    months premature and were in intensive care for two months after their birth.

    i agree with the portland, ore., farmer who asked, "why all the commotion about
    how to stop a rooster from crowing?" may i add a few words: chickens are originally
    from the jungle. their wild relatives have lived in tropical forests for tens
    of thousands of years. perched in the trees and sensitive to infrared light, roosters
    see the morning light at least 45 minutes before we humans do. they also have
    very keen ears-a distinct advantage when living amid dense foliage. it can be
    difficult to see a predator and keep track of one''s flock. why do roosters crow?
    through their crowing, every rooster knows where every other rooster is at all
    times. each rooster can recognize the crow of at least 30 other roosters-probably
    more. as the protector of the flock, roosters are always on the lookout for possible
    enemies that could threaten their well-being. in his own fascinating world of
    chickendom, the rooster is a lover, a father, a brother, a food-finder, a guardian
    and a sentinel. he is nothing to abuse, scoff at or degrade. karen davis, ph.d.,
    president, united poultry concerns inc.'

    in may, arlington heights-based township high school district 214 tragically announced
    that marijuana use among high school students was climbing at an alarming rate.
    shocking news, considering that prevention professionals recently applauded the
    decline in alcohol use among teens. after a decade of successful drug prevention
    efforts, our youth are walking away from america''s most popular lethal drug-alcohol.
    sadly, the school district announcement is testimony to the drug culture''s persuasive
    and fallacious promotion of marijuana as "harmless." why are we shocked, given
    our elected official''s quasi-endorsement, "i didn''t inhale," and the surgeon
    general''s ludicrous bid for "legalization research"? the tribune celebrated the
    20th anniversary of high times magazine, the country''s most revered champion
    of illicit drugs, with front-page coverage in the tempo section and in august
    supported marijuana''s legalization for therapeutic purposes. even dear abby has
    been duped, writing in may that legalizaton would put drug dealers out of business!
    law enforcement ignored weedfest, an annual event that openly glorifies marijuana
    use. this current public intrigue with marijuana is an affront to our corporeal
    integrity. it''s also the assassination of our youth. if we don''t work hard to
    get the cold, hard truth out about marijuana use, as we did with tobacco and alcohol,
    we will see the cold, hard death of another generation. the university of mississippi
    has conducted more than 10,000 studies that identify the destructive effects of
    marijuana. other studies report alarming findings. young marijuana smokers have
    an increased cancer rate. people using synthetic thc, the major psycho-active
    ingredient in marijuana, are to be closely supervised and are not to engage in
    any activities requiring sound judgment. further, thc is highly abusable and can
    produce both physical and psychological dependence, psychosis, hallucinations,
    depression, panic and paranoia, among other symptons. don''t fall prey to empty
    rhetoric favoring the research of marijuana. these programs serve to be no more
    than legal handouts under the guise of education. marijuana is a drug. its powers,
    like its promoters, are smooth, slow and persuasive. together, their effects are
    cunning, baffling and deceiving. sound familiar? ---------- forum is designed

    he''s a racist. for example, while he was driving, a police car came up alongside

    give his ticket, and i pointed to the ticket taker. my escort then said, "you
    mean that midget?" (the ticket taker was short, and my escort has a very deep,
    loud voice that carries.) he calls all germans "nazis," latinos are "joses," blacks
    are "leroys" . . . and he hates indians because he had a bad encounter with one.

    i am a married woman, age 35, who is still contemplating having a baby, even though

    of having a painful delivery. i know that women vary greatly in their childbirth

    agony before using it as a last resort? curious'

    i am a 19-year-old girl who is very much in love with a guy i''ll call billy.

    i wanted to test his faithfulness, so i asked tina-my best friend-to call up billy
    just to see if she could get him to go out with her. well, she did, and billy
    jumped at the chance. she said he didn''t take her to any place special; they
    just rode around, got some burgers, then parked and made out. (just hugging and
    kissing.) i finally told billy that i had set the whole thing up with tina, and

    here''s another "clean" army story: i was serving in the fourth armored division,

    day, i hate wearing anything on my head-and wearing my helmet, even in combat,
    i loathed. my captain was always yelling at me, "haley, put your helmet on! you
    wanna get killed?" i''d put it on and wear it until he was out of sight, then
    take it off. one morning when i was shaving, i had my helmet propped between my
    feet-using it as a wash basin and using the side door mirror on my truck for a
    mirror. enemy shrapnel blew my helmet from between my feet, leaving a good-sized
    hole in the side of the helmet. with my finger stuck through the hole, i went
    to my captain exclaiming, "captain, i''m sure glad i wasn''t wearing my blankety-blank

    you recently published a letter about a young couple''s wedding mishap on a cruise

    had two months to plan our wedding after my fiance learned he would have his leave
    from the army. my budget was very tight, so i made the bridesmaids'' dresses,
    and because i didn''t want to put anyone in a financial bind, i also paid for
    the tuxedo rentals. it was the hottest day of june, with thunderstorms. my parents''
    toilet overflowed that morning, with a house full of houseguests. my maid of honor
    spent the previous day at the beach, where she got a terrible sunburn on her back
    and shoulders. one of the ushers was told his army leave was canceled. our reserved
    motel room was "taken" when we got there. and when we returned from our brief
    honeymoon, we discovered that the photographer (a friend) had used only black-and-white
    film! that was 25 years ago last june. we have only one colored photo of us walking
    down the aisle. (a guest took it.) it''s a little out of focus and taken from
    a strange angle. did any of this dampen my spirits? not on your life-i was on
    cloud nine! it was a marvelous day for us, and we have had others, such as the
    births of our children and their graduations from high school and college. we
    count our blessings-not our mishaps! blessed in delaware'

    give me a few hours. take me and my cumbersome wheelchair to the mall so i can
    see the lights and hear the music. i would also like to be driven around town
    to see the christmas decorations-then maybe stop for hot cocoa. i would like a
    book of postage stamps, a writing tablet with lines and some plain envelopes.
    i would appreciate a ballpoint pen that works, and some telephone coupons so i
    can make a few long-distance calls to people i will probably never see again.
    i would also appreciate a visit from you and other family members, especially
    my grandchildren who call and say: "hi, grandma. how are you? i love you. gotta
    go. see you later. bye!" i would like someone to offer to pay my heating bill
    for one month. (with five sons, six daughters and 42 grandchildren, that shouldn''t
    be so hard to do.) and i sure wish someone would come over here and test my smoke

    my husband and i are having a disagreement, which i hope you can settle. he says
    i''m overreacting, but i think i have every right to be upset. ever since i married
    "norm" three years ago, i have supported him and his children from a previous
    marriage on a teacher''s salary. needless to say, we live from paycheck to paycheck.
    our credit cards are maxed out, and we have had to borrow money from our parents
    to live. nine months ago, norm''s sister "emily" asked him to install heating
    and air conditioning in her new home. he did, but she hasn''t paid norm one dime!
    i estimated the total amount to be somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000. with
    this, we could have paid off almost all we owe on our credit cards, and also for
    the repairs to our house and car. i feel used. it''s one thing for norm to expect
    me to support our family, but for emily to take advantage of me too is a bit much!
    i know she has no intention of paying him, and he has no intention of asking her
    for the money. emily''s income is three times greater than ours, and she just
    came into a substantial inheritance, so she can well afford to pay norm for his
    work. the financial strain has taken a toll on our marriage. am i wrong to be

    co-workers, family and friends, responded with money, food and clothing. (after

    they have been given two "replacement showers" to replace the gifts they had received

    my husband recently passed away after a long illness, and many friends and relatives
    were very supportive during that time. his funeral was attended by such a large
    number of people there weren''t enough seats in the chapel to seat everyone. "george"-one
    of my sons-was a pallbearer. a neighbor who attended the funeral had the nerve
    to ask me a few days later, "has george cried yet?" what a terrible question!
    even though george didn''t cry at the funeral, i know his heart was heavy. it''s
    too bad we all can''t cry when people expect us to. besides, god gives us extra
    strength when we need it. abby, please put this in your column. some folks are
    better at controlling their emotions than others. still grieving'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    now that the holiday travel season is upon us, may i give your readers some tips
    for traveling by air? as a veteran flight attendant with a major airline, i offer
    the following: 1. an airline''s only responsibility is to transport you safely
    from point a to point b. all the little extras-movies, meals, magazines, etc.-are
    not available on every flight. some airlines are now cutting costs by eliminating
    meals, so before you fly, call and ask if there will be food service. if there
    is none, bring your own if you must eat during this time. this is especially important
    if you are traveling with a child, because we don''t carry formula, baby food
    or bottles. 2. if you have medical needs, please bring your own supplies. i''ve
    had people ask me for insulin, sleeping pills, aspirin and diapers. we carry none
    of these things. 3. the two most dangerous parts of the flight are takeoff and
    landing. before each flight, take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your
    nearest exit, oxygen mask and flotation device. if you don''t watch the safety
    demonstration that we perform before every flight, at least read the safety card
    found in your seat pocket. even if you are a frequent flier, you will not always
    sit in the same seat in the same type of plane on every flight. 4. unaccompanied
    minors are children under 12 who are traveling alone. if you are sending your
    child on a flight alone, please provide him or her with books, toys, games, snacks,
    etc. if a plane is full, flight attendants won''t have time to entertain children
    during the flight. also, teach them to use the "call buttons" at their seats if
    bothered by another passenger. 5. finally, please remember that flight attendants
    are aboard as safety professionals. if you are asked to store your luggage, or
    fasten your seat belt, it is for your own safety. we are the most important piece
    of safety equipment on the plane, and deserve the cooperation of all passengers.

  body: 'dear readers: by popular demand, here is my traditional thanksgiving column:
    tomorrow is thanksgiving day, so take a few minutes to think about what you have
    to be thankful for. how''s your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived
    this long. a lot of people haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands-maybe millions-are
    hurting more. (have you ever visited a veterans hospital? or a rehabilitation
    clinic for crippled children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear
    the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast
    table on two good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise the lord!
    a lot of people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world
    is a lot poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security.
    in fact, one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are
    you lonely? the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, call someone.
    go out of your way to do something nice for somebody. it''s a sure cure for the
    blues. are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our system has
    been saved by such concern. concern for fair play under the law. your country
    may not be a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds. freedom rings!
    look and listen. you can still worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret
    ballot, and even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head
    or a knock on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different
    system, you are free to go. there are no walls or fences-nothing to keep you here.
    as a final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will want
    to use it at your table tomorrow: o, heavenly father: we thank thee for food and
    remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank
    thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember
    the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service. that thy gifts to us
    may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving, and may god bless
    you and yours. love, abby an afterthought: want an instant high? the surest cure
    for the post-holiday blues is to do something nice for someone. why not call someone
    who lives alone and invite him or her over for dinner? better yet, call and say,
    "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get home." (many older people
    don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out alone after dark.) p.s. special
    greetings to those of you in the military who wrote from remote corners of the

    whatever is happening to the english language? my pet peeve is the use of the
    word "gentleman." abby, even you have been guilty of this. a man should be identified
    as a man-or a male-but so often i see the word "gentleman" used when there is
    no indication that the man is a gentleman. for example: after the attempted assassination
    of president reagan, an officer said, "the gentleman who shot president reagan
    . . ." worse yet, i heard this on the news: "the gentleman who raped the elderly
    woman . . ." abby, please bring back proper word usage. p. fuller, cupertino,

    you have always been a wonderful source of information. i hope that you will find
    this a worthy topic to share with your readers: every day we receive telephone
    calls from frightened, sad and desperate people who are dealing with the terminal
    illness of a friend or loved one. we are able to help. we are hospice. contrary
    to what many believe, hospice is not a destination. we are a service, provided
    by more than 1,800 affiliated medicare-licensed agencies dedicated to the care
    of dying people and their families. when all avenues of cure have been exhausted,
    the terminally ill, their families and physicians turn to us. hospice doctors,
    nurses, counselors, aides and volunteers work to ensure that patients live comfortably
    at home until death. skilled caregivers attend to the physical and psychological
    needs of the patient and the family. so what''s the problem? not everyone knows
    that hospice exists. both the public and the medical community deserve to know
    what hospice offers. some important features: 1. we work with the patient''s doctor,
    taking orders and directions from him or her. 2. all available and appropriate
    techniques to control pain and other symptoms are applied. 3. most hospice care
    is done at home. (the great majority of our patients live and die in their own
    homes.) 4. the cost is covered by medicare and many private insurance companies.
    5. hospice provides care without regard to age, diagnosis or ability to pay during
    the final months of life. 6. hospice specializes exclusively in the care of dying
    people. by facilitating at-home care, hospice saves money and keeps the patient
    in the environment of his or her choice. the care is both cost-effective and compassionate.
    for information about hospice services across the nation, write: the national
    hospice organization, p.o. box 9998, arlington, va., 22209. jane d. evans, director,

    my wife and i have just made the heartbreaking decision to sever all ties with
    our adult son (i''ll call him mike). this was done with much regret, but we could
    see no other way. mike went through a bitter divorce years ago. there were accusations
    of infidelity on both sides. his wife was not interested in having a family. as
    a result, he is very sour on marriage and has vowed never to wed again. mike has
    been living with a woman with whom he has fathered two children, and she has just
    announced that she is pregnant again. mike''s mother is in poor health, and this
    is putting her in her grave. we asked him to please stop coming by or calling
    our home. we also made it plain that we do not wish to be informed when the new
    baby arrives. we respect his decision not to repeat the pain of a failed marriage;
    however, we think it is wrong for him to continue having babies with a woman who
    is not his wife. we feel it is also wrong for her to continue to get pregnant,
    knowing how he feels about commitment. i have known people who have had one child
    out of wedlock and made the best of it-but for two adults to bring three illegitimate
    children into the world is cruel, selfish and irresponsible. how much effort does
    it take to slip on a condom, or swallow a birth control pill? i have told mike
    that his children will be excluded from our will and family tree. also, i am worried
    about the state of these illegitimate children''s souls. after all, they were
    conceived in sin. through with mike'

    three years ago, i was exposed to genital herpes. i have not dated anyone since
    then. recently i met a very nice man and have gone out with him a few times. we
    are very much attracted to each other. we''re not kids-we are both over 25. i
    live in a small town and people talk. i believe in being honest about this, but
    i can''t discuss my situation with anyone. i feel totally alone, although i am
    sure there are others who share my problem. my question: when should i tell this
    man i have herpes? alone in colorado dear alone: you may feel "alone," but you
    are far from it. an estimated 40 million americans have become infected with herpes-about
    1 in 4 adults. less than half of them are aware of it. as you know, the outbreaks
    come and go, and although they are sometimes inconvenient, they are not life-threatening.
    the herpes resource center has a network of approximately 100 local support groups
    around the country, which provide information and emotional support, and offer
    the opportunity to talk about your situation (or listen to others) in a confidential
    environment. the purpose of these meetings is to share experiences and obtain
    a broader knowledge of how the virus affects others who have it. the herpes resource
    center is a program of the american social health association, or asha, whose
    services include a national herpes hotline, support groups and a quarterly journal.
    for information about the services, call 1-800-230-6039 or send $1 to: herpes
    resource center, asha, dept. pr46, p.o. box 13827, research triangle park, n.c.,
    27709. (no self-addressed, stamped envelope is required.) asha has recently published
    an informative book, titled "managing herpes," by charles ebel (available at the
    above address). it is priced at $19.75 (includes postage and handling). proceeds
    from book sales support the work of asha, a non-profit organization dedicated
    to stopping sexually transmitted diseases. if the price is too steep, your library
    may have the book, or be able to get a copy. now, to answer your question: tell

    it was a fun thing, and we used it a lot (and still do) along with a few other

    a recent column had several letters from women 60 and over who had cute responses
    to questions regarding their age. i think these women are part of the problem.
    our culture extends neither status nor credit to its aging population. today there
    are more of us than ever before, and we are striving to age with grace and dignity,
    but there seems to be a consistent, subtle and insidious message that it is not
    ok to get older. for example, try to buy a birthday card that doesn''t refer to
    the loss of memory, sight, body functions or body parts that no longer work properly.
    let''s fight back! let''s establish models for aging with grace and dignity, and
    change our own negative views on aging and the attitude of the younger generation.
    there are cultures that respect their older members for their wisdom and knowledge.
    i worked hard to get where i am today. i had lessons to learn and many to relearn-and
    i am still learning. that''s what life is all about, isn''t it? tell your age.
    be proud of it. show others that you have earned the wisdom and balance to enjoy
    life even more. joan belshin, 62 years old, sacramento, calif. p.s. one of the
    cleverest birthday cards i have seen is by seinfeld. it reads: "you are lucky
    to be growing older. now, if you want a cookie, you can have a cookie!"'

    "dear abby" has a little islamic competition in iraq. every friday, televisions
    across the country tune in to sheik abdul-ghafar abbasi to hear the popular muslim
    preacher read viewer mail and hold forth on topics like marrying older women,
    drinking and dealing with jews. the program is part of the creeping islamization
    in what was once the staunchest of secular regimes. saddam hussein''s government
    is trying to use religion to curb growing social ills and court fundamentalists
    in other muslim states. "religion can be used to protect society from any kind
    of social problems. religion means good behavior, religion means no crime, no
    robberies, no murders," said abdel-razak al-hashemi, head of the foreign relations
    department of the ruling baath party. diplomats also believe the approach is designed
    to appeal to islamic stalwarts in neighboring states such as saudi arabia who
    have been increasingly vocal in the criticism of the ruling saud family for depending
    on the u.s. to protect them. the words allahu akbar, arabic for "god is great,"
    now grace the iraqi flag. baghdad''s racetrack was closed six months ago and the
    city''s domestic airport, heavily damaged during the persian gulf war, is supposed
    to become the site of the largest mosque in the world. public functions start
    with prayers. hussein appears often with clergymen. but perhaps the most dramatic
    change was last summer''s ban on alcohol, seen as a drain on foreign exchange
    and a source of iraq''s fast-growing crime rate, which has leaped 40 percent since
    1990. baghdad always has been famous for its fish restaurants and nightclubs along
    the tigris river, which went full throttle during the gulf war, closing only during
    the heaviest bombing. the recently imposed restrictions have been eased only to
    allow people to drink at home and to offer lenience to christians, who may obtain
    licenses to sell alcohol. but any restaurant or hotel operator caught with liquor
    on the premises risks losing his license. the strictly enforced ban was at least
    partly inspired by the yawning gap between the wealth of black market profiteers
    and the impoverished middle class, which was wiped out financially by roaring
    inflation fueled by the united nations'' economic blockade imposed after iraq
    invaded kuwait in 1990. seeing the nightly parties with countless bottles of whiskey
    that cost the equivalent of two months'' salary for the average employee was doing
    little for public morale. "this is the real revolution in iraq," a western diplomat
    said. koran lessons are now mandatory in primary and secondary schools. there
    also is a daily afternoon tv program to teach children how to intone the special
    arabic of the islamic holy book. but there are limits. religious activism among
    shiite muslims, who rebelled after the gulf war, is little tolerated. there are
    still cells of al-dawa, a shiite fundamentalist party inspired by the 1979 iranian
    revolution. too fervent prayers in shiite mosques can lead to arrest for suspected
    membership in the group. islamic militants based in lebanon, where radical shiites
    have strong ties, took responsibility for a bomb that exploded recently at the
    religious affairs ministry, killing one and seriously injuring five. fundamentalists
    are a key target of the friday afternoon tv program, "the faithful," broadcast
    on the station run by saddam son, uday. "through my program, i warn people against
    extremist groups," sheik abbasi said in an interview. abbasi, 60, has been the
    target of islamic critics-his postgradu-ate training comes from an obscure cairo
    institute-and some people on the street say he is too much of a government mouthpiece.
    but the program is widely popular, in part because he speaks in the local iraqi
    dialect and not the formal arabic used in most broadcasts. "usually, religious
    people are solemn in their answers and appearance. he is popular with the young
    because he speaks their language and answers their problems," said the iraqi information
    minister, hamed youssef hammadi. much of the program consists of answers on questions
    of religious practice like the best way to wash before prayers. he is most frequently
    asked about social problems. one man wanted to know if it is permitted to marry
    a woman 20 years his senior despite family opposition. "the prophet mohammed married
    his wife khadija when she was 20 years older than him, so why shouldn''t you,"
    was the answer. he wades into international politics with a vengeance. on saudi
    arabia: "for their treachery they will die one day. they do not represent islam
    in the world." on jews: "in one (chapter) of the holy koran it says you will find
    your bitter enemy among the jews." on a saudi sheik who criticized him for supporting
    kissing holy shrines: "why are you kissing the shoes of jews and americans and
    not kissing the shrines of the holy men?"'

    i''m writing as a follow-up to your column on the great american smokeout. many

    lives. in my case, i quit smoking the day i found out that i had cancer of the
    tongue. during the course of a year, i had cobalt radiation, iridium implants
    twice, plus two major surgeries to remove my tongue and left jaw. due to the expertise
    of my surgeon, almost 17 years later, i am here to write this letter. as a result
    of my smoking, i have no sense of smell, and i lost about 90 percent of my ability
    to taste. i have one-half of a lower jaw, no teeth (although i do have an upper
    denture), and it takes me an hour to eat an average meal. what has kept me going?
    positive thinking. also, i have become a health nut. i walk two to five miles
    a day, rain or shine. because of me, nearly 100 people have quit smoking. all
    it took was for them to take a look into my "gorgeous" mouth. to those who continue

    you recently asked for wedding horror stories, so we are sending ours. the vocalist
    at the ceremony (the bride''s sister) got so emotional in the middle of her solo,
    she choked up, burst into tears and was unable to sing another note. then, when
    the minister asked the friends and family to signify their blessings of the union,
    a little girl shrieked at the top of her lungs, "no!" in the middle of the outdoor
    reception, rain began to fall. immediately after the ceremony, the groom had to
    change from his tuxedo into his street clothes because his best man, who was going
    to return the groom''s tux to the rental place, got an emergency call and had
    to leave early. the two bartenders got drunk, left the bar, and started dancing
    with female guests. then everybody started helping themselves to the liquor. and
    guess what? we''ve never had a better time at a wedding. it all depends on your

    don''t you think it''s time we retire some of the traditions that originated when

    the responsibility for wedding expenses was assigned to the parents, it was common
    for children to marry when the bride was still a child. she was prepared to be
    only a housewife, and seldom-if ever-gainfully employed. likewise, the groom was
    a youth likely struggling to establish a home. hence, a tradition was born, based
    on common sense. the bride and groom of today, however, are usually older, and
    on more stable financial ground than their parents were. why should older people
    have to mortgage their homes, spend their retirement nest eggs, or take out loans
    to pay for lavish weddings, while the newlyweds trot off to luxury homes? it''s
    insanity that a supposedly intelligent, educated society clings steadfastly to
    outmoded traditions from horse and buggy days. modern etiquette should be updated

    don''t see anything wrong with this, but it just turns my stomach, and my husband

    my husband and i have been married for 27 years and have three grown children.
    his jobs have caused us to move to various states and, consequently, i''ve had
    few opportunities to spend christmas with my parents. my father passed away last
    year and my mother is now 81, and quite frail. i propose that we fly to michigan
    to spend christmas with my mother. she has even offered to pay our plane fares.
    my husband refuses to go because mother lives in a cold climate, and he doesn''t
    want the hassle of traveling during the christmas holidays, with the threat of
    ice and snow. i feel that this may be my mother''s last christmas. our children
    and grandchildren have offered to travel to wherever we are to be with us for
    christmas. abby, this is causing a lot of animosity between my husband and me.

    this january, the american optometric association will begin the fifth year of
    our vision usa program to provide free eye care to low-income, uninsured working
    people and their families. last year, "linda l." read about the program in your
    column. she had been laid off her job and couldn''t get another one because, at
    the age of 49, her vision was too blurred to read a job application and do the
    detailed computer data entry work for which she was qualified. through vision
    usa, linda received the eye care she needed. three weeks after getting her new
    glasses, she found a job. she was one of approximately 32,000 people served last
    year by nearly 8,000 optometrists who donated their services through this program.
    nine out of 10 of these people had eye health or vision problems. these included
    such conditions as a detached retina, glaucoma, cataracts and many common vision
    problems that make it difficult for adults to work and for children to learn in
    school. from jan. 3 to 31, 1995, low-income working people can be screened for
    eligibility for the 1995 vision usa program by calling 800-766-4466. phone lines
    will be open weekdays from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. central standard time. people can
    also apply by mail. application forms are available from vision usa, 243 n. lindbergh
    blvd., st. louis, mo. 63141. completed forms must be postmarked by jan. 25, 1995.
    because the phone lines are sometimes very busy, it may be easier to apply by
    mail. will you please alert your readers to the vision usa program again this
    year? larry decook, o.d., american optometric association'

    i have been a fan for years, but have never written. however, today i saw your

    i find myself inclined to write. let me explain: i, too, am a twin, and i''d like
    to share an incident that happened to me. my twin sister and i and some friends
    had gone to an amusement park and visited the "house of mirrors." (remember those
    mazes of mirrors in which the challenge was to find your way out?) once inside,
    we engaged in a game of tag, and i was "it." wandering up and down the halls of
    mirrors, i made a turn and suddenly saw my sister a few feet in front of me. i
    jumped at her, hoping to tag her before she could get away. imagine my surprise
    and embarrassment as i staggered backward after colliding, headfirst, with a mirror!
    it was not my sister but my own image i had seen in the mirror. i hope my strange
    case of mistaken identity gives you a chuckle. if i ever have to answer that "stupid"
    question, "do you ever get yourselves mixed up?"-i will have to say "yes!" jo

    resolutions are based on the original credo of al-anon. i am using that theme
    with some variations of my own: just for today i will live through this day only,
    and not set far-reaching goals to try to overcome all my problems at once. i know
    i can do something for 24 hours that would overwhelm me if i thought i had to
    keep it up for a lifetime. just for today i will be happy. abraham lincon said,
    "most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be." he was right.
    i will not dwell on thoughts that depress me. i will chase them out of my mind
    and replace them with happy thoughts. just for today i will adjust myself to what
    is. i will face reality. i will correct those things that i can correct and accept
    those things i cannot. just for today i will improve my mind. i will not be a
    mental loafer. i will force myself to read something that requires effort, thought
    and concentration. just for today i will do something positive to improve my health.
    if i''m a smoker, i''ll make an honest effort to quit. if i''m overweight, i''ll
    eat nothing i know to be fattening. and i will force myself to exercise-even if
    it''s only walking around the block or using the stairs instead of the elevator.
    just for today i''ll do something i''ve been putting off for a long time. i''ll
    finally write that letter, make that phone call, clean that closet or straighten
    out those dresser drawers. just for today before i speak i will ask myself, "is
    it true? is it kind?" and if the answer to either of those questions is negative,
    i won''t say it. just for today i will make a conscious effort to be agreeable.
    i will look as good as i can, dress becomingly, talk softly, act courteously and
    not interrupt when someone else is talking. just for today i''ll not try to improve
    anybody except me. we know so much more about nutrition and how exercise and sensible
    living can extend life and make it more enjoyable, so just for today i''ll take
    good care of my body so i can celebrate many more happy new years. just for today
    i will have a program. i may not follow it exactly, but i will have it, thereby
    saving myself from two pests: hurry and indecision. just for today i will gather
    the courage to do what is right and take the responsibility for my own actions.

    to head down the road, away from the child. as i started to return to my house,
    her mother thanked me, then turned to her daughter and told her that it wasn''t
    necessary for her to have screamed. it stopped me in my tracks. i politely corrected
    the mother, saying her daughter had done the right thing in screaming, because
    her screams had attracted my attention, causing me to come to her rescue. screams
    are meant to alert others to danger, whether real or imagined. we do our children
    a great disservice when we teach them not to scream. are we more worried about
    the possibility of disturbing the neighbors than we are about the safety of our
    children? i would prefer to answer a hundred "false alarms" than miss the opportunity
    to protect a child in danger. with the polly klaas tragedy so fresh in our minds,
    would the outcome have been different had she and her friends screamed when the
    intruder entered her room? no one knows the answer, but one thing is certain,
    she wouldn''t have died alone without someone trying to save her life. do your
    children a favor. encourage them to scream. it is an important defense tool. don''t
    raise a silent victim. you owe this to your children. stan ziegler, houston'

    my fiance and i are both in our mid-70s. we found each other a year ago, along
    with love, sex and all the good things in life. we both have equal incomes from
    social security; in addition, we each have weekly supplements, job-wise. she has
    no mortgage or car payments, which i do have. the problem is, she thinks that
    i should pay for all the outside activities, such as entertainment, dinners out
    and gas for the automobile trips we take together in my car. in this day of liberation,
    am i asking too much to expect her to go 50-50? i do all her household repairs
    and maintenance, besides my own. please advise a fair solution to this problem.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have just completed editing and organizing five years of videos, correspondence
    with elected officials and organizations, and magazine and newspaper clippings
    concerning the abortion issue. i thought the results might interest you. one side
    of the issue spoke of prevention of unwanted pregnancy through information, education,
    birth control and affordable, available contraceptives. this side supports a woman
    having the right to make her own decision concerning herself, but thinks that
    a woman who is not pregnant doesn''t need to decide if she should have an abortion.
    "respect the right, reduce the need." the other side spoke only of abortion being
    wrong (or a sin), and thinks there are no rights where a woman is concerned. her
    only choice comes before the pregnancy, and male responsibility is never mentioned.
    this side feels that information promotes experimentation, sex education encourages
    sexual activity, and its reference to birth control is abstinence. planned parenthood
    was organized in 1921 for the purpose of giving information on birth control to
    low-income women, who otherwise couldn''t afford prevention of unwanted pregnancies.
    that was 52 years before the courts made abortion legal. it was later expanded
    to include contraceptives, testing and treatment of infertility, plus any disease
    connected with the sex organs. in our geographic area, planned parenthood''s present
    campaign is focused on men, and their greater involvement in unwanted pregnancies.
    the demoss foundation has spent more than $100 million on its "life, what a beautiful
    choice" campaign. neither the commercials nor literature i have received contains
    any mention of prevention, or of reducing unwanted pregnancy. the commercials
    are filled with happy, loved, well-cared-for children, giving the impression that
    this is the way of life for all children. which side of the issue is really pro-life,
    and spends its money, time and energy toward a future filled with children who
    are wanted, loved and cared for? i know from experience that abortion can have
    benefits. it''s a much different time now, and it is within our reach to achieve
    the prevention of unwanted pregnancy-and that is the answer. i am pro-choice,
    but i did not distort the above facts. i am also a member of the religious coalition
    for abortion rights and am very proud to be a planned parenthood volunteer, so
    if you choose to publish my letter, you are very welcome to use my name. patricia
    murchek, tucson, ariz.'

    can you stand one more story about funny names? if so, you are welcome to use
    mine. it''s ho. around christmastime, our family has always been greeted with
    "ho-ho-ho!" in 1960, when i married my husband, there were only six ho''s in the
    los angeles telephone book. apparently no one had heard of a last name with two
    letters, so when i''d give my name over the phone, i was asked, "is it hole?"
    i''d repeat, "no, it''s ho . . . just two letters, h and o." we have received
    letters addressed to "the holes" and "the halls." my husband''s first name was
    garrett, so some mail came addressed to "mr. and mrs. h.o. garrett." when i got
    pregnant with our first child, here are some of the names the people in my office
    suggested: "if it''s a girl, name her `ida,'' then her name would be `ida ho.''
    " "if it''s a boy, name him ivan, westward, tally, or even gung. ..." also, some
    people added an "e" to our name. we explained we are not the garden tool. now,
    with the influx of asians, there are many ho''s, and i''m sure some of them have
    had the above experiences. amy c. ho p.s. my maiden name is chow. when i was a
    girl, someone inserted an "r" in my first name, and i was called "army chow"!'

    we''ve heard enough about insensitive mothers-in-law. now let''s talk about insensitive
    daughters-in-law. take mine, for example. i wrote to ask if i could visit my new
    grandbaby for five days. this meant an 800-mile drive (one way), plus overnight
    in a motel. just before my departure, my son called to say that a three-day visit
    would be better for them. i said: "fine. no problem." upon arrival, i found a
    note on their door explaining that nobody was home but that my son would be home
    right after work, so i waited. i saw my beautiful grandbaby that evening. the
    next morning, mom and baby suddenly had to go to the library. joyfully, i offered
    to baby-sit, but my offer was declined, so to occupy myself, i borrowed a bicycle
    for the afternoon and returned to their house at 5 o''clock. my son and daughter-in-law
    were just getting up from the table-their dinner was finished! as my allotted
    three days would be up the next day, i left the next morning for my long drive
    home. i don''t look forward to next year''s visit, but i want to see my beautiful
    grandbaby again. i wonder, abby, what you-and your readers-think about this kind
    of hospitality from a daughter-in-law? jill in oregon'

  body: 'dear readers: an anonymous reader sent me this piece (which i''ve slightly
    edited) i think you will appreciate. i hope the author will identify himself (or
    herself) and claim the credit-or blame, depending on the way you interpret it.
    the childless couple there is nothing sadder than a childless couple. it breaks
    my heart to see them relaxing around swimming pools in florida, sitting all suntanned
    on the decks of their boats-trotting off to europe like lonesome fools. it''s
    an empty life. the poor childless couple are so wrapped in themselves, you have
    to feel sorry for them. they don''t fight over the child''s discipline, don''t
    blame each other for the child''s obnoxious characteristics and miss all the fun
    of doing without for the child''s sake. they just go along, doing what they want,
    buying what they want. it''s a pretty pathetic picture. everyone should have children.
    no one should be allowed to escape the wonderful experience that accompanies each
    stage in the development of the young-the happy memories of sleepless nights,
    coughing spells, tantrums, diaper rash, debts, emergencies and never-ending crises.
    the real fulfillment comes as the child grows up. the wonder of watching your
    overweight ballerina make a fool of herself in a leotard. the warm smile of a
    lad with 500 bucks worth of braces ruined on peanut brittle. how dismal is the
    peaceful home without the constant problems that make for a well-rounded life
    and an early breakdown; the tender discussions when the report card reveals the
    progeny to be one step below a moron; the end-of-the-day reunions with all the
    joyful happenings recited like blows to the temple. children are worth it all.
    every moment of anxiety, every sacrifice pays off as fine adolescense is reached.
    the feeling of reward the first time you took the boy hunting-he didn''t mean
    to shoot you; the lad was excited. remember how he cried? how sorry he was? these
    are the times a man with a growing son treasures-memories that are captured forever
    in the heart and the limp. think back to the night of romantic adventure when
    your budding daughter eloped with the village idiot. what childless couple ever
    shared in the stark realism of that drama? aren''t you a better man for having
    lived fully, acquiring that tic in your left eye? could a woman without children
    touch the heroism of your wife as she tried to fling herself out of the bedroom
    window? the childless couple live in a vacuum. they fill their lonely days with
    golf, vacation trips, dinner dates, civic affairs, tranquility, leisure and entertainment.
    there is a terrifying emptiness without children, but the childless couple are
    too comfortable to know it. you just have to look at them to see what the years
    have done: he looks boyish, unlined and rested; she''s slim, well-groomed and
    youthful. it isn''t natural. if they had had kids, they''d look like the rest
    of us-worn out, wrinkled and exhausted.'

    recently a family member married a woman from a different part of the country.

    but the husband always asks me on the side if i have washed the bananas i serve
    with breakfast, as his wife insists on having the bananas washed. the first time
    he asked me, i asked him if his wife eats the peel, because i have never heard
    of washing a banana. (he said no.) i have since asked around and have found nobody
    who washes bananas. i wash apples, pears, grapes and melons, which i will be cutting
    through, but i see no reason to wash bananas. some people told me to wash only
    the bananas being used that day, because there is a natural protective coating
    on the skin and washing it away will cause it to spoil quicker. my husband gets
    annoyed when he sees me washing a banana because he thinks it''s silly. abby,

  body: 'dear readers: did you know there is an international forgiveness week? well,
    neither did i-until six years ago, when alice parenti of fresno, calif., wrote
    to tell me about it. and this is the week. if you are a card-carrying member of
    the human race, there is at least one person in your life who needs your forgiveness.
    or perhaps it''s you who needs to be forgiven, so let go of those grudges and
    give your ulcer a chance to heal. robert muller, former assistant secretary general
    of the united nations, wrote this lovely piece for international forgiveness week:
    decide to forgive decide to forgive for resentment is negative resentment is poisonous
    resentment diminishes and devours the self. be the first to forgive, to smile
    and to take the first step, and you will see happiness bloom on the face of your
    human brother or sister. be always the first do not wait for others to forgive
    for by forgiving you become the master of fate the fashioner of life the doer
    of miracles. to forgive is the highest, most beautiful form of love. in return
    you will receive untold peace and happiness. here is the program for achieving
    a truly forgiving heart: sunday: forgive yourself. monday: forgive your family.
    tuesday: forgive your friends and associates. wednesday: forgive across economic
    lines within your own nation. thursday: forgive across cultural lines within your
    own nation. friday: forgive across political lines within your own nation. saturday:
    forgive other nations. only the brave know how to forgive. a coward never forgives.
    it is not in his nature. now, dear readers, if you will forgive me for repeating
    a portion of the lovely poem titled "forgiveness," by george roemisch, here it
    is: "forgiveness is the fragrance of the violet that clings fast to the heel that
    crushed it." so, if perchance you are the "heel" that crushed a violet, this is
    the week to seek forgiveness. love, abby'

    your column about whether to wear a sexy dress to a class reunion dinner dance
    prompts this letter. my college graduation class celebrated its 50th reunion in
    1987. when i was a freshman, my parents bought me a red crepe formal, cut on the
    bias. it had spaghetti straps, was rather low-cut and had rhinestones 2 inches
    apart all over it. i loved that dress and wore it many times. (who could afford
    more than one evening gown then? it was the depression.) when i married in june
    1937, i took that dress with me. it hung in my closet for years and i just couldn''t
    bring myself to get rid of it. finally, when my 50th college class reunion took
    place, i wore that red dress again. a 70-year-old female classmate spied me across
    the dance floor and shouted, "nina! i hate you-i can''t believe you can still
    get into that dress!" i''m enclosing a picture of myself in that clinging red
    dress at the reunion banquet. when you''re through laughing, please destroy it.

    heaven''s sake, mom, he''s old enough to decide for himself whether he can have
    coffee or not so late in the day!" then guilt set in when i remembered doing the
    same thing not long ago when i said to my married daughter, "dear, aren''t you
    too hot in that sweater?" she kindly replied, "if i get too hot, i''ll take it
    off, mom." no matter how old your children are, it''s hard to get out of the habit
    of mothering them. my new year''s resolution is to kick that "mothering" habit.

    hot tub in the nude without offending anyone. the problem is our neighbor''s 9-year-old

    should wear bathing suits because they can''t watch their son 24 hours a day,

    i ordered my favorite meal-fried chicken and creamed corn. the waiter returned
    to tell us that they were out of creamed corn. i''m told that i raised such a
    fuss that my mother left the restaurant, found a grocery store nearby, purchased
    a small can of creamed corn, and asked the chef to please warm it for me. (he
    did.) i only vaguely recall the incident, but my grandmother, who has been dead
    for years, used to tell that story every time she saw me. fortunately, i''ve outgrown

    though i was stealing from strangers-one of my ancestors was privileged to have
    received them on mt. sinai from the lord himself-at least that''s what the good
    book says. originally, i wrote two sets of commandments, one for men and one for
    women. then, mandy stillman, a lawyer and feminist from milwaukee, wrote to demand
    equal rights for women, insisting that there be only one set of commandments.
    she was right, of course. so how''s this for a gender bender? the ten commandments
    of love: - thou shalt put thy mate before thy mother, thy father, thy son and
    thy daughter, for thy mate is thy lifelong companion. - abuse not thy body with
    excessive food, tobacco, drink or any foreign substance that goeth into thy arm
    or up thy nose. - do not forget that cleanliness is a virtue. - permit neither
    thy business nor thy hobby to make thee a stranger to thy children, for the most
    precious gift a parent can give his or her family is time. - make not a beggar
    of thy mate. willingly share with him or her thy worldly goods. - forget not to
    say, "i love you." for even though thy love may be constant, thy mate doth yearn
    to hear those cherished words. - remember that the approval of thy mate is worth
    far more than the adoring glances of a hundred strangers, so cleave unto thy mate
    and forsake all others. - keep thy home in good repair, for out of it cometh the
    joys of old age (not to mention its resale value). - forgive with grace, for who
    among us does not need to be forgiven? - honor the lord thy god all the days of
    thy life, and thy children will grow and bless you. tomorrow, be a sweetheart.
    call someone you love and say, "i love you." (make two or three calls; who says
    you can''t love more than one person-in different ways, of course?) go through
    your closets and give all those clothes you''ve been saving until you lose 10
    pounds to your favorite charity. call someone who''s lonely and say, "i''m thinking

    who desperately want to have a child but cannot-or one whose only child has died.
    we who have children may find humor in the scenarios, but what about those who
    did not choose to be childless? they would welcome the sleepless nights, diaper

    there are many of us who are childless not by choice. have you ever stopped to
    think of what our lives might be like? yes, you might see us "relaxing around
    swimming pools in florida or trotting off to europe like lonesome fools," but
    have you ever stopped to consider that we might be attempting to escape the loneliness
    of the void of childlessness? it is very easy to cast judgment on others, but
    i suggest before you do that, you walk in our shoes. the saddest part of my day
    is when i hear the endless complaints some people make about their children. this
    is the injustice of it all: you are blessed with gifts from god-your children-yet
    you do nothing but complain of the responsibility, cost, problems, etc. well,
    be thankful for your blessings, because you might just raise children who will
    be childless by choice-because of your actions as parents. childless in houston

    several months ago, a friend (i will call her kate) offered to get some theater
    tickets for my husband and me. i had to be away on a business trip the day the
    tickets went on sale, and since "jeff" and i wanted good seats, we took kate up
    on her offer. we gave her the $150 for the tickets and thanked her for doing us
    the favor. when we returned, kate called with the news that she was able to get
    us excellent seats, and that she would get the tickets to us soon. i saw her several
    times after that, but she never got around to delivering the tickets. when it
    got close to the date of the performance, she finally confessed that she had "misplaced"
    them, but that she was sure she could locate them. well, she never did, so in
    addition to the disappointment of missing a great show, i was out $150. my husband
    and i agree that kate should reimburse us for the tickets she failed to produce,
    but neither of us wants to risk a confrontation. how should we handle this? no

    i have been following with great interest your letters from people with odd names.
    my first name is philomene (the french of philomena-a bad situation made worse).
    it is pronounced phil-o-men, as if there were no last "e." it is not pronounced
    philo-mean, philo-meanie, phi-lom-enie, filament, philodendron, or-i really hate
    this one-philistine. if i leave a message that philomene called, nobody calls
    me back. (spelling it doesn''t help; trust me.) using ms. plus my last name would
    be considered pompous in our casual university environment. people will return
    calls to "phil," but even though i answer my phone, "this is phil speaking," they
    still ask to speak with "him." yesterday a caller exclaimed, "oh, you''re a girl!"
    i cheerfully replied, "well, since the operation." (how was i to know they were
    from the national science foundation?) the direct mail advertisers of america
    have long since decided that i was a guy, as did the marine corps, who asked me
    to be one of the few good men. there are some advantages, of course: people remember
    you. they remember you have an odd name; they just don''t remember what it is.
    lest you think i''m a recent immigrant, my mother was margaret smith from akron,
    ohio. (she swore her intentions were good.) my advice to parents is to name your
    kids something that people can spell and pronounce-or hope they learn to fight
    young. (your offspring won''t mind spelling an unusual name the first 28,000 times,
    but then it gets old.) a rose by any other name would still be a rose, but i assure
    you, a philomene by another name would have been a heck of a different person.

    i recall an episode of abc''s "grace under fire" (wednesday nights) that had a
    powerful effect on me, because i, too, am a divorced mother of young children.
    in this particular episode, the divorced mother had bought and gift-wrapped some
    christmas presents and put their father''s name on them. the young son was upset
    because his father didn''t show up or call him on christmas, which would have
    meant more to him than the gifts his father supposedly had sent, which he told
    his mother-through his tears. his mother then assured the boy that his father
    really loved him very much, but like some men, he just wasn''t very good at expressing
    himself. she then told him how very proud his father was when he was born, and
    she emphasized that although "dad" didn''t spend much time with him, he really
    loved him very much. abby, i was emotionally overcome with this episode, because
    i''m sure many divorced mothers identified with it, as i did. grace sacrificed
    the momentary "satisfaction" she might have gotten from making a few nasty remarks
    and pointing out what a heel the father was. instead, she built him up to be more
    of a loving father than he really was, and avoided saying anything negative about
    him. let''s face it, if the father really is an insensitive slob, the kid will
    figure it out for himself soon enough. grace refused to reinforce the boy''s feeling
    that his father didn''t love him. (what kind of mother would want her child to
    have to deal with that kind of pain?) unfortunately, too many divorced parents
    are quick to criticize the other parent-some even make up lies if the truth isn''t
    "bad" enough. they also try to outdo each other with gifts, deny each other access
    to the child, and generally make the child feel miserable. how i wish more divorced
    parents would show a little more "grace under fire." a divorcee, wichita, kan.'

    according to a gallup poll conducted for the alzheimer''s association in 1993,

    of "early onset" cases of people in their 40s and 50s, distinguishing signs of
    alzheimer''s disease from normal aging is of utmost importance. to assist people

    see their doctors for a proper diagnosis, the alzheimer''s association has launched
    a major educational campaign that includes public service announcements, educational

    of alzheimer''s disease, titled "is it alzheimer''s? warning signs you should
    know," is now available by calling the alzheimer''s association''s toll-free number:

    understandably, parents don''t want their kids to get ripped off when they are
    buying their first home. but folks should remember that there''s a fine line between
    being helpful and being a pain in the neck. q-i have been looking for my first
    home for about two months. my dad has owned his own home for 40 years and insists
    on accompanying me every time i look at a house. although i have seen two or three
    houses i liked, he talked me out of making an offer on them because he thought
    they were either overpriced or needed too much work. i appreciate some of his
    comments, but others are nitpicking and i''m beginning to think that i will never
    find a home that suits him. how can i gracefully tell him to "butt out"? a-you
    probably should have sent this question to "dear abby" instead of me. i''d suggest
    that you gently remind your dad that you are the one who is buying the house and
    will live in it, not him. tell him you appreciate any constructive criticism he
    has to offer, but remind him that no home is in perfect condition. if your dad
    is giving you part of the down payment or will have some other financial interest
    in your purchase, assure him that any offer you make will take into consideration
    the fix-up costs that you''ll incur after you move in. you might even be willing
    to make your purchase offer contingent upon your father''s written approval. a
    reasonable seller could accept such a condition, especially if your dad is providing
    some of the financing. understandably, parents don''t want to see their kids make
    bad decisions. but suggestions should be limited to topics with which they are
    familiar. all parents should be particularly wary of offering advice on technical
    issues, such as the wording of a purchase offer or a home''s structural soundness:

    her promise. when she was over at our house, i said, "mom, how do you like the
    two new appliances?" she said, "oh, you showed them to me last time i was here;
    they are very nice." then she changed the subject. abby, this is not the first
    time she has offered to help with payments. three years ago, we went shopping
    for wall-to-wall carpet, and she promised us she would help with the payments,
    and that was the last we heard about it. i am really upset about her broken promises.

    i live in a large apartment complex. each building has a laundry room with several
    washers and dryers. however, some of us have a recurring problem with our neighbors.
    some people leave their things in the washer or dryer for a long time, which means
    that the rest of us have to wait to do our laundry until they remove their stuff.
    how long should we wait before removing their laundry? the problem is that there
    is no place to put their laundry, and most people don''t want anyone else touching
    their stuff. there are lighted timers on the washers and dryers, but i''ve had
    to wait sometimes 45 minutes until a machine is available. i know this may not
    sound like a critical problem, but it is very frustrating. sign me . . . "wet

    to all of your female readers who are approximately 20 years into their second
    marriage, i have a question: do you have a copy of your divorce papers from your
    first husband? i faced this problem when my second husband died, and i applied
    to social security for his larger social security pension check. they told me
    that besides my current marriage certificate, i must present my divorce papers
    from my first husband! (that was more than 20 years ago!) i thought my marriage
    certificate would be the only vital document they required. they insisted, and
    i realized that i was going to be denied this much-needed increase in my now single
    income because i just could not find the paper. fortunately, i was able to contact
    my first husband, and he was gracious enough to send me a copy. check this out,
    gals, because you have probably done as i did during those long years of a happy
    second marriage-tossed out those unnecessary and bad memories of the first marriage.

    most fast-food places have a policy about pets brought into their establishment:
    it''s ok if the pet is on a leash. my fiance and i brought our pet iguana into
    an establishment in chula vista. he was on a leash and wasn''t bothering anyone.
    this place had a sign up that said, "no dogs allowed unless accompanied by a disabled
    person," but it didn''t say anything about other pets on a leash, so we assumed
    it was ok. when we walked in and ordered, nothing was said. it was like, "let
    them order, take their money, and as soon as they sit, deliver the message about
    their iguana." we were told the other customers were feeling uneasy about our
    pet. we had seated ourselves far from the other customers, yet we were asked to
    sit outside. i saw this guy on television walking the streets and beaches of los

    my daughter (i''ll call her jolene) made the mistake of marrying "hank," a jerk
    who turned out to be an alcoholic drug-abuser and wife-beater. he kicked her in
    the stomach when she was five months pregnant. fortunately, the baby survived,
    and she summoned the courage to leave him and file for divorce. hank denied that
    the baby was his, and talked his new girlfriend into paying $600 for the dna test,

    hank has fathered-and abandoned-six other children by four different women. in
    divorce court, the judge ruled that $90 a week shall be withheld from his paycheck
    for child support. out of seven children, my grandson is the only one to get any
    support. after their divorce, jolene met and married "stan," a wonderful young
    man who is the complete opposite of hank. stan doesn''t drink or do drugs and
    would never raise a hand to a woman. he genuinely loves my grandson as though
    he were his own, and stan''s parents do too. he''s already seen a lawyer about

    a few weeks before thanksgiving, our grandniece (who goes to preschool) got head
    lice and her two brothers caught it from her. the boys had open sores from it.
    all three children were treated and everything was disinfected at home. three
    days later her mother, "alice," took her daughter back to this preschool where
    it seems (according to my sister-in-law) that the people who work there think
    it''s "no big deal," because they deal with it every day. alice did not have to
    take her back there. we feel that she shouldn''t have exposed the little girl
    to lice willingly. my family and parents were invited to my brother''s home for
    thanksgiving dinner. alice called to invite herself. after discussing the lice
    problem with everybody who was to be there, we told alice that we wouldn''t be
    comfortable if she brought her children there, when she willingly took her daughter
    back to this lice-infested preschool. abby, this was not easy to do, because we
    all love her dearly. but we were afraid we might get lice. we all have had to
    deal with lice, because it''s in the public schools. but you don''t take your
    child back to the place with lice if you don''t have to. we offered to take food
    to her and her kids, but we were told "no." we have some very hurt feelings over
    this, even after all this time. (by the way, alice''s parents were out of town.)

    she was sitting there with a teenaged son who was facing neurosurgery. she cited
    people who went on and on about their wonderful year sending that newsletter to
    someone "whose relative is battling a life-threatening illness," or the writer
    who talks of a job promotion to someone who''s unemployed. this woman''s viewpoint
    is totally self-focused. how is everyone who sent her a christmas card supposed
    to know what is going on in her life? what has happened to her good sense-and
    yours? in case you think i am writing from a picture-perfect life: i was caring
    for my terminally ill mother one christmastime (she died at easter, weighing 60
    pounds). i was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy two days before
    thanksgiving. my beloved father-in-law died 10 days before yet another christmas.
    and one year, i had to write to say that my brother had been brutally murdered.
    the christmas of ''94, i will include the news that i buried the fifth and final
    member of my parental family. three weeks ago, the last of my three brothers died
    of cancer. so now, i am the sole survivor. (eight of my family have died of cancer.)
    do i want to hear from "insensitive" people who might tell me that someone in
    their family has cancer? of course i do! if it''s terminal, i will commiserate
    with them. if not, i will rejoice! do i want to hear about the wonderful family
    reunion you had last summer because my own family is gone? yes! families are what
    keep this planet going! hardly anybody makes it through this life without feeling
    the sting of splinters from a heavy cross. hearing others'' good news while bearing

    to annoy people. maybe she was just trying to make conversation, to be friendly.
    i would recommend starting with a positive comment. for example: "you certainly
    have an interest in food. are you a gourmet cook?" then end with, "you seem very
    interested in what i am eating, but your curiosity about what i am eating detracts
    from my enjoyment. so how about talking about other things during break?" jean,

    please help my friend and me settle an argument. we have agreed to abide by your
    decision. "matt" and i both play cello for a small community orchestra. although
    it is not a full-time vocation for either of us, it is a hobby at which we both
    excel. for two years, we have enjoyed a friendly rivalry as we compete for various
    solos and other honors. the competition took an unfriendly turn several weeks
    ago when matt "inadvertently" ran over my cello with his station wagon when i
    was loading our instruments into the back. my cello was destroyed, and it was
    right before a concert in which i had a solo. because i had no instrument, matt
    got the solo that night. my cello is certainly replaceable, and matt has offered
    to purchase a new one for me. our concern is this: because matt had demolished
    my cello, i felt that he should have offered me the use of his cello for that
    evening''s concert. matt, however, feels that he had no obligation to surrender
    his cello. what do you think, abby? kathi'

    my problem is one i rarely see addressed in your column. i have a daughter who
    is 5 years old and in kindergarten. she has been taught not to talk to strangers.
    unfortunately, strangers don''t seem to want to leave her alone. we cannot go
    to the grocery store without some man-usually older-speaking to her or touching
    her. last summer, we had a frightening experience when a strange man grabbed her
    and tickled her roughly. it took my hysterical screaming to get him to let go
    of her, and then he acted like i was a nut. when i try to explain to these men
    that my daughter is not allowed to talk to strangers, they invariably say, "it''s
    all right; i''m a grandfather!" (as though that ensures he''s not a pervert.)

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    yesterday, my father died. my immediate reaction was relief that his prolonged
    illness had at last ended. this poor soul had suffered a few small strokes, had
    parkinson''s disease and arthritis, and last fall we had to admit him to a nursing
    home when i could no longer continue to care for him. he had a tube to his stomach,
    a catheter from his bladder, and in his last eight months had been back and forth
    to the hospital for blood transfusions, oxygen, urinary infections, etc. the last
    month, he no longer recognized me and was, in my opinion, 95 percent dead. we
    wouldn''t allow an animal to suffer this way. why should a sick old man of 88
    years endure so much? could it be that the nursing home collected some $2,400
    per month for his care? he had a living will-but this only provided that if his
    heart stopped, there would be no heroic measures to revive him. why won''t the
    medical profession let nature take its course? why insist on prolonging a life
    that really is not living anymore? it was terrible to see what dad suffered, and
    i visited him every day. it was terrible to see the other patients in this nursing
    home crying out for help when there was nothing that could be done. thank god,
    it''s finally over for my father. but it was the longest eight months he ever
    lived. when he was able to communicate, he was distressed for me to see him in
    this condition. medicare can only go so far, so his savings were about depleted.
    i can''t feel much sadness that he''s gone, only that he had to suffer so much
    before his heart finally stopped beating. we can only hope that something in the
    future will change before any of us have to go through the same misery. i''d do
    anything to prevent my family from seeing me linger that way. grieving daughter'

    tower in chicago, which is only 1,454 feet tall. there are other communication
    towers in the world that are even taller, but to the best of my knowledge, the
    cn tower is the tallest self-supporting one (no guy wires), and it is the only
    one in which there is an elevator to a public restaurant and viewing platform
    near the top. although it is not an office building, it is a building, albeit

    to get their groceries loaded into three baskets. (the load was so big, i had
    to call another sacker over to help me carry their groceries to their car, which
    happened to be a taxi.) guess what kind of a tip i got? nothing! not even a quarter.
    i suppose some people would say, "well, that's just part of the job for which

    had my hug from you today." my husband then gave her a bear hug, complete with
    grunts and growls. the daily hug scene went on for a few weeks, then i finally

    i am a widow with two children. i live in a townhouse with neighbors on both sides.
    a new family (mom, dad and two children) moved in next door. the first night i
    was awakened about 1 a.m. by a horrible noise that turned out to be both parents
    snoring. i spoke to them about this (nicely) and asked if there was something
    they could do about it. they assured me that since they worked different shifts,
    it wouldn''t be a problem again. well, it is a problem. separately, their snoring
    is bad enough, but now i am faced with it 24 hours a day. except for a few afternoon
    and early evening hours, someone is always snoring. i spoke to them about it again
    and suggested a sleep clinic at a local hospital. they suggested i move my bedroom
    or use earplugs. i can''t use earplugs because i have two young children. i have
    spoken with these neighbors about it and spoken to my landlord. i am desperate
    for a good night''s sleep. what should i do? knoxville'

    i caught a 10-year-old neighbor girl stealing money out of my purse last year.
    (i''ll call her sally.) i talked to her, and told her i would give her another
    chance instead of speaking to her parents about it. sally agreed to this, and
    i thought she was doing ok. since then, i have learned that another neighbor had
    a few small objects stolen from her home, and i''m afraid the thief was sally.
    should i talk to her and let her know what i suspect? or should i let the other
    neighbor know that i caught sally before, and i suspect her? or should i talk
    to sally''s parents? abby, i hate to think that beautiful child might grow up

    i read the letter you published from "inmate 711895" and had to respond. "inmate"
    stated that he smoked marijuana for 20 years, and during that time, he also used
    cocaine. if his consumption of those substances was so harmful, how was it that
    he was married, had a good job, a home in the suburbs and a clean record? in other
    words, if used in moderation, drugs do not prevent a person from leading a normal,
    productive life. his letter was much more of an indictment against drug prohibition.
    his letter could have been written 65 years ago by someone convicted of selling
    beer or whiskey. it took a commission headed by a fellow named wickersham to bring
    an end to the folly of alcohol prohibition. surgeon general elders has called
    for a similar commission to study whether the benefit of some forms of drug legalization
    might outweigh the tremendous cost of prohibition. abby, if cocaine were a drug

    of ladies from the white alloe chapter of the d.a.r. in the little town of parkville,
    mo., were helping 79-year-old lucille douglass and her friends raise money to
    restore a one-room brick schoolhouse built in 1885 for black children. the d.a.r.
    ladies spent many hours at the local historical archives searching out information
    to get the little school listed on the national historic register. the school
    grounds were cleared of brush by men who were veterans of foreign wars. an italian
    construction company owner, experienced in historic renovation, offered free labor
    to help with the restoration once the funds are raised. union plumbers and plasterers
    also have volunteered their services. since parkville is a suburb, we feel this

    it is good, because if we didn''t have the whales, we wouldn''t be able to learn
    about them or we wouldn''t be able to study them. at one of the aquariums, beluga
    whales are fitted with a test model of an identification band, designed by canadian
    wildlife biologists to radio-track these whales in the wild. they treat them like
    they''re in the wild, but the trainers do have to feed them fish by hand. the
    belugas like the kids and adults to visit them!! i know some people don''t like
    what these people are doing to these whales, but they are taking good care of
    them. nicole s., 12, chicago i believe the film makers who think they can get
    away with making one more "free willy" movie are fooling themselves (april 26
    tough news). sure, they can use old footage and have a new plot, but that doesn''t
    take away from the fact that keiko is being used as a senseless toy for greed
    money-makers. '' they''re using a fragile thing such as life to promote "peace"
    and "freedom." what happens when the toy stops spinning and keiko''s spirit dies
    away? karen m., 13, highland park i can''t believe that keiko is still not free.
    "free willy" was about people exploiting a whale for money. this is actually happening
    in real life. keiko has to live in a dolphin tank in mexico. a new cooling system
    is not going to cut it. keiko should be free. elisabeth k., 12, wheaton the ideal
    guy i''m a pushover for flattery, as long as it''s not sugary or fake. most girls
    i know are (pushovers), too. most of my friends are guys, and i find them a lot
    easier to talk to. a guy who cements his head with styling (goop) is a big turn-off.
    a guy that knocks you out cold with cologne turns me off instantaneously. intelligence,
    humor and optimism are my favorite things in a guy. egotistical and sleazy guys
    are disgusting. pinching butts and sleazy comments are two more big turnoffs.
    i like courage and a quick smile. looks and social status aren''t big things with
    me. a cute guy is a special treat. well, i hope this letter will help out a few
    more guys in the world. mindy i., 14, lombard bad vibes i''m not sure of everyone
    else''s opinion, but one thing is bothering me. your newspaper has been bad-mouthing
    la toya jackson''s psychic line, but you run a horoscope in your paper. i''m not
    saying anything good about la toya''s hotline or the horoscope. both are incorrect
    in my book. (but) that seems kind of strange. becky k., 12, peru tense situation
    the situation in israel bothers me a lot. all the fighting really scares me because
    it''s not only happening in the middle east, but it is spreading into america.
    innocent people are getting hurt or even killed. after what happened in new york
    (five jewish boys were shot) my private jewish school hired a guard as a precaution.
    seeing the guard every day scared my friends and me. i have relatives in tel aviv...
    and i want them to live. it''s scary!! israel is the jewsu land. will the adults
    stop fighting and please make peace? elynn p., 12, chicago recently, israel had
    a terrible event occur. a jewish settler went into a holy place for muslims and
    opened fire on praying people. now, many people are persecuting the jews because
    of what one man did. i am jewish, and i totally disagree with what the man did.
    if anyone out there thinks that all jews are bad because of one jewish man''s
    actions, you are very mistaken. stephen s., 12 ted r., 13, highland park trash

    there was an article on trading food with other kids at lunch time. well, in my
    school, we canut trade lunches or even give someone a part of our own lunch, because
    if we do, we get our names on the clipboard. i''m sure a lot of schools are that
    way, too. so i think maybe the teachers should read the article and let us trade!
    especially when someone doesn''t have a lunch! beth l., 11, round lake beach dumb
    thinking there''s so much racist hatred. just the other day, someone burned a
    cross on a black family''s lawn. what is that? a cross isn''t supposed to be a
    hateful sign. the way to stop racism starts in the classroom. there has to be
    classes on racism, and field trips where people show equality and educate people
    on racism. i try educating, but it''s hard because i''m not considered an adult.
    well, if i''m right, does it matter how old i am? i just wish people would see
    what racism does to the world. remember, there is only one race, and it is the
    human race. bob k., blue island i''m responding to erica w. (april 19 backtalk).
    when st. patrick''s day came, people at my school were wearing buttons that said
    "kiss me, i''m irish." nobody made a racist remark to them. maybe the person who
    made a racist remark to the german was a racist themselves. doreen t., 11, north
    chicago good spray the new graffiti stuff for kids instead of spray paint is a
    really good idea (april 19 kidnews). except the bad thing about it is there is
    a certain way you have to hold the bottle so that it works right. it''s better
    than having permanent paint, because it washes off. it can also save cities''
    money, because they won''t have to clean the walls off as much. lisa e., 14, galena
    (editor''s note: remember, you''re supposed to spray your own little patch of
    property with the chalk spray, not any other person''s private property!) ''why
    waste time?'' why should we waste time or money on people who already have it?
    people are complaining about the homeless. so why don''t you do something about
    it? tracy p., 13, hillside ''list'' too intense i am writing in response to monique
    l. (april 19 backtalk). you obviously have never seen "schindler''s list." i have
    seen it, and let me tell you, it was rated r for a reason. i saw that movie ...
    and i remained extremely depressed for at least two days after seeing it. it was
    not rated r only because of its sexual content. i believe it was also because
    of its graphic death scenes. i won''t mention just how graphic they were. most
    people were crying during the movie, but i didn''t cry until i got home, because
    i was in total shock. if i was a high school principal, i wouldn''t let my students
    see this movie, because even though i learned a lot from it, i wish i hadn''t
    seen it. kathryn k., 14, crystal lake kids'' point i agree with abby b. (april
    12 backtalk). i think that (reviewing movies) shouldn''t be from a parent''s point
    of view. they don''t know what we like at all. i do have a mom that is not like
    that, but most all of the critics are. emalee a., 12, hillside more rides! i think
    great america should get more than one new ride each year (april 19 kidnews".
    they make so much money that they could afford a new one. if they get more than
    one ride, it would split the lines up. the new ride is 20 minutes long; it will
    be a long wait. i just think that if they make so much money, they should be able
    to afford another ride. brandon w, 12, highland park helping hand i disagree with
    rachel k. of forest park (april 19 backtalk) when she said that we shouldn''t
    send any more troops out to somalia. the united states has many jobs, some which
    include helping out other countries in time of war. we have kept too many u.s.
    troops out of other countries. believe it or not, i feel honored that our country
    is willing to fight for the world as well as we do. alana s., 13, deerfield mike
    the spike why did you put "error" jordan (april 12 sports)? i think you should
    give him respect because michael is still cool, even though he is down in double-a.
    timothy k., 13, hillside huh, huh, movie cool we think it would be a pretty good
    idea to have the beavis and butt-head movie (april 26 kidnews). we think they
    should not have beavis and butt-head using fire, because it will influence other
    kids to do the same. the purpose of the movie is to make people laugh and not
    create violence. so by keeping out fire, it would make it a better movie. so we''re
    just saying they should watch what they put in it. brandon r., 12 lindsay g.,

    not stay yard-bound. it is therefore obvious to me that a cat should be considered
    a house pet only. i sympathize with the death of a pet. i hope when zelda meets
    princess crossing that famous "rainbow bridge," her pet confronts her with the

    i am an 18-year-old senior girl, and have been attending boarding school for two
    years. several weeks ago, my mother ran across my diary in a drawer at home, and
    she read it. knowing that my mother has always been very curious and she was not
    above reading my diary, i wrote it in french. however, she had it translated.
    as a result, my mother and i haven''t spoken in over a month. i use writing as
    a release, so many entries were hateful toward my parents. i also wrote about
    my personal life, mistakes i had made, and even my innermost feelings. my question
    to you, abby, is: is it right for parents to read their children''s diaries in
    order to find out about their lives? i believe that reading my diary was the ultimate
    invasion of my privacy. my mother also read my diary when i was much younger.

    what do you do with a husband who thinks that as long as he gives his wife his
    paycheck, he is being the perfect husband? we have been married for five years,
    and he never once has put his arms around me unless i''ve asked him to. he''s
    29 and i''m 26. when i ask him if he loves me, he says, "i married you, didn''t
    i?" maybe i shouldn''t complain because he is decent, hardworking and faithful,
    and we are both regular churchgoers. but how can i get him to be more loving?
    he talks baby talk to our dog. needs love'

    i really need a friend. i''m a nurse, age 24, single and childless. i seem to
    be one of those women who always have to have a man in their life. not to brag,
    but i am attractive. two years ago, i ended a two-year relationship with a man
    i almost married. i thought he was perfect for me; then he started to accuse me
    of seeing other men. i couldn''t tolerate the mistrust, so i quit seeing him.
    a few months later, i found my "perfect" man. abby, he was wonderful. he loved
    doing all of the things you rarely find men wanting to do, like holding hands,
    walking in the rain, and shopping late at night. he was my best friend and lover.
    the problem came when i was nearing graduation from nursing school. he became
    possessive and jealous. he gave me time limits on how long i could stay in the
    mall with friends. he insisted on seeing the receipts from the stores i had been
    to, to prove that i had really been there. at first i tolerated it, until he started
    to follow me. (he even lost a good-paying job because of his absence from work
    to follow me!) he accused me of sleeping with other men. the last straw was when
    he drove me down a dark road and told me he was not taking me home until i confessed
    my "unfaithfulness." i had nothing to tell him. he scares me. what should i do?

    friend of mine told me he knew of a body that was buried in the 17th century in

    and fingernails. i told this person that i didn''t believe it, so the two of us
    called about 100 funeral homes in our area and were told they had never seen any
    skeletons with hair and fingernails. well, my friend still wasn''t convinced.
    abby, you have a lot of contacts with people in authority, so perhaps you can
    find out whether this is true or not. my friend said if he was wrong, he would
    eat our wood-burning stove. i don''t want to see him eat the stove, but i''d like

    my boyfriend (i''ll call him george) and i have a strong relationship based on
    mutual trust. we have been going together for six months. after going with his

    there is only one thing from my past i have not told george about. i had a short-term
    physical relationship with his brother, and now the two of them are in business
    together. i did tell george i had had a previous relationship and i told him a

    get the urge to smoke. as a child, i was teased by close family members who knew

    well, i''m married now, and i don''t resemble bugs bunny in the least! my husband

    while rummaging through some old papers, i found a dear abby column about crowing
    roosters that i clipped, intending to respond. here it is, finally. the writer
    claimed that if a rooster can''t raise his head and stretch his neck, he cannot
    crow. on our small island, we kept roosters and chickens in the back yard of our
    parsonage. because of other fowl in the neighborhood, crowing was no problem.
    after my husband died, my son and i moved to an apartment with two chickens and
    a rooster. in our more closed environment, the rooster became a problem, so at
    dusk, we put the rooster in a box and placed it in the closet. promptly at 3 a.m.,
    the rooster crowed! naively thinking, as your reader did, that a rooster needs
    to raise his head and stretch his neck in order to crow, we modified the box so
    the rooster could not stretch his neck. you guessed it! the next morning, the
    rooster crowed at 3 a.m. in the very low cardboard box in a dark closet. we finally
    gave the rooster away, and we still do not know what can keep a rooster from crowing.

    staunch republican, wrote the following in his new york times column on may 16:
    "i read the full transcripts of speeches as delivered and can testify that bill
    clinton is a first-class political evangelist. he''s a believer in people taking
    care of each other; it''s a passion, not a pose. "the president told a rapt audience
    of teenagers at kramer junior high in washington, d.c.: "''every day you have
    to decide whether you''re going to be here on time with a good attitude, learning
    as much as you can. every day you have to decide what you believe, what you care
    about, and what kind of person you''re going to be.'' "to the girls: `first thing
    you can do is make up your mind that you''re not going to have a baby until you''re
    old enough to take care of it, until you''re married.'' to the boys: `this is
    not a sport; it''s a solemn responsibility.'' "in this year''s state of the union
    address, the president said: `let''s be honest. our problems go way beyond the
    reach of any government program. they are rooted in the loss of values, the disappearance
    of work, and the breakdown of our families and communities. we cannot renew our
    country when within a decade more than half of our children will be born into
    families where there is no marriage.'' "to a black congregation in memphis, clinton
    said: `there are some changes we''re going to have to make from the inside out
    . . . the answers have to come from the values and the stirrings and the voices
    that speak to us from within.'' "clinton imagined dr. martin luther king jr. saying,
    `i did not live and die to see the american family destroyed,'' and asked: `where
    there are no families, where there is no order, where there is no hope . . . who
    will be there to give structure, discipline and love to these children? you must
    do that.'' "to a national service gathering in brooklyn, clinton recalled the
    murder 30 years ago of kitty genovese, whose cries went unheeded by 38 witnesses
    who did not want to get involved by calling police. the president said: `no nation
    hiding behind closed doors is free, for it is imprisoned by its own fear . . .
    we''ve got to change the basic attitudes of this country. not only about crime
    and violence, but about how we think about ourselves and each other.'' " safire
    also noted: "conservatives can differ with clinton''s collectivized health care
    and the redistribution of wealth, but should not worry about raising ratings by
    applauding his eloquent calls for family responsibility and mutual reliance. "in
    coming weeks, clinton will deliver commencement addresses, teach civics classes,
    observe anniversaries of d-day and school desegregation. when a president eloquently
    preaches the american gospel, as clinton has been doing, we in the media should
    disseminate it far and wide."'

    this is in regard to "churchgoer in plano, texas": abby, your response perplexed
    me. why is it setting a poor example to put nothing in the collection plate at
    church? maybe the person is out of work, or has suffered some serious business
    reversals. the only example that should be set is one of kindness. those people
    need the fellowship of church more than ever. people should give what they can,
    pass the basket along and mind their own business. and by the way, abby, if people
    choose to steal from the collection, they will have to answer to a higher authority
    than "churchgoer." p.l. in denver'

    i was recently followed on the freeway by a male driver who stayed directly behind
    my car through a series of lane changes and speed changes. i went from suspicious,
    to nervous, to really scared as i realized that he was, indeed, following me.
    he then followed me off the freeway and through a series of turns while i searched
    in vain for a police station. i could find absolutely no signs indicating the
    location of the police station, sheriff or highway patrol. finally, i pulled into
    a business where there were a number of men standing outside. after slowing to
    survey the situation, the pursuer drove on. abby, why don''t police stations have
    more signs indicating their location? without a car phone, it could be dangerous
    to stop to call 911. your readers would benefit from some advice on the best course
    of action if they are pursued on the road. desperately seeking the police station'

    i am asking you a question i am sure many people would also like answered. why
    do doctors prescribe medicines to patients that cost a fortune, then after a few
    doses, change the medication to something else that also costs a fortune? i have
    a full bottle of medicine that cost me $26. i took it twice, then the doctor gave
    me another prescription to fill. when i asked him, "what should i do with the
    bottle i have?" he said, "just throw it out!" i am close to 80 and cannot afford
    to throw money away. please put this in your column because the next time a doctor
    prescribes 100 pills to be taken one a day, i''m going to say, "why don''t you
    prescribe only 20 pills, and if you want me to take more, i''ll order more?" not

    after reading the letter from "curious in south carolina," regarding the possibility
    of newspaper employees opening mail addressed to "dear abby," i have another question:
    what do you do with the letters you receive after they are used (or not) in your

    if the writer has included a name and address. some of that information is highly

    three years ago, our family of five (with three adult sons) solved, in a unique

    money to give in a personal way to someone in need. abby, the results have been
    wonderful! our christmas shopping has been simplified, and we can''t wait to exchange

    flowers for widows in a nursing home who don''t ordinarily receive visitors. if

    your advice to tell adopted children that they were "chosen"-giving them the assurance
    that they were "special"-was once in vogue. today, it seems falsely sentimental.
    we do not "choose" a child in the way we might choose a dress from a rack, and
    no child is any more "special" than any other. ("special" is often used as a euphemism
    for a child with disabilities.) an adopted child today is usually told the facts
    surrounding his or her adoption. ours have been told that when they were born,
    their birth parents were unable to properly care for them, and while that may
    be sad, we are very happy to have become their parents-and cannot imagine our
    lives without them. most of us who have adopted children of another race must
    arm ourselves with snappy retorts. you wouldn''t believe some of the questions
    we get from strangers. for example: "where did they come from?" "what happened
    to their real parents?" "do you have any of your own?" "what language will they
    speak when they start talking?" cheri register, minneapolis'

    today i saw something that brought back some very unpleasant memories from my
    childhood. i was having a manicure when a woman with three boys (about 6 months
    through age 9) came in. this woman (i''m assuming their mother) expected the oldest
    boy to take care of the youngest while she sat and had her nails done. of course,
    the baby was restless, so she told the boy, "walk him around in the stroller."
    the boy went outside for a few minutes and then returned. again she said, "i told
    you to walk him around!" he left again and returned a few minutes later. i could
    tell the boy did not want to do the task his mother told him to do. why do parents
    expect the eldest child to become a built-in baby-sitter or -worse yet-a parent?
    it wasn''t the child''s decision to have another baby; it was the parents''. just
    because a child is mature for his or her age doesn''t mean he or she should be
    responsible for a baby and miss out on their own childhood. i speak from experience-like
    that little boy, i too was expected to care for my little brother. (we were 10
    years apart.) i was just a little girl; i wanted to be a child, not a mother.
    didn''t that mother understand the little boy did not want to be outside and risk
    one of his friends from school seeing him push a stroller? you have no idea how
    embarrassing it is for a child! i''m 34 years old and still remember those memories
    like it was yesterday. all i can say is, if someday i am blessed with two children,
    i will never treat the firstborn this way. firstborn in california'

    all over the world and enjoyed a variety of life experiences. you are not going
    to believe this, but i have never been asked out on a date! i have gone out socially-i
    asked the son of a family friend to the junior prom-and have gone out with groups
    of friends for years. i have even used escort services for business functions.
    but i have never had a boyfriend, or the chance to turn down someone i didn''t
    like. mother and father told me there is a lid for every pot. lately, they haven''t
    mentioned the subject. i have a good sense of humor and have been told i''m interesting
    to talk to, but no man has ever shown a romantic interest in me. i dress well,
    and some people have told me i am pretty. two years ago, i adopted a child. i
    live a full life and don''t sit at home or get depressed. however, what i really
    want in life is to meet a man who shares my interests and wants to build a life
    with me and my daughter. i can be alone, but i would rather not. do you have a
    solution? single in seattle'

    each year about this time, my wife and i leave for arizona-our "winter escape."
    we thoroughly enjoy meeting our winter friends, and our schedules are always busy.
    our problem: some people seem to think that we''re going to a warmer climate so
    they will have a place to visit every winter. in subtle ways, our friends suggest
    they need a winter break and would we mind if they came down to visit us. what
    can we say? and when they''re there, they love to use us as a hotel and restaurant
    and for transportation and entertainment. in addition to interfering with our
    own schedules, it becomes costly. benjamin franklin said (in poor richard''s almanac),

    i am writing on behalf of many senior citizens who do their shopping accompanied
    by a younger companion. invariably the salesperson will direct his or her inquiries
    to the younger person, making such comments as, "what is she looking for today?"
    or, "what size does he wear?" elderly people find these comments irritating and
    humiliating. even if infirm in body, most senior citizens can answer any questions

    you helped her get pregnant; did you use any protection? son: no! that''s left
    up to the dumb girl! mother: really? do you ever want children? son: no! i don''t
    like kids! mother: have you ever thought of a vasectomy? condoms? a spermicide?
    you know-foam or sponges? son: no, all that is for the dumb girl to do. mother:
    did she want children? son: yes, she told me she wanted to have my child. mother:
    she told you that, and you went ahead and had sex with her without using any protection?
    son: but, mom-she knew i didn''t want kids. she should have been taking the pill!
    mother (shaking her head): you knew she wanted your child, and you did nothing
    to protect yourself? son: yes, and now i''ve blown my chances of going to college.
    all because of a baby i didn''t want in the first place. i''m going to have a
    vasectomy so this won''t ever happen again! mother: isn''t that like closing the
    barn door after the horse is gone? son: mom, please, i don''t need that! mother:
    you are my only child, and you are going to be a father at 19. it''s a good thing
    your father is dead because this would kill him. your dad''s dream was having

    i am writing about your response to "mildred from minnesota," who wondered about
    using strollers with babies facing forward. your response: "if the baby is facing
    its mother, the baby would have to ride backward. i would assume that babies,
    like adults, prefer to see where they are going-not where they have been." abby,
    before strollers came on the scene, we had prams and buggies with babies facing
    their mothers, but more important, with mothers facing their babies. in my opinion,
    mothers facing their babies is more important than babies seeing where they are
    going. after witnessing a baby in a forward-facing stroller being strangled by
    the strap holding him in the stroller while his mother was totally unaware of
    the situation, i began observing stroller situations and talking to mothers. i
    found a frightening number of mothers who had experienced incidents with forward-facing
    strollers. one mother did not know that her baby''s foot was rubbing against one
    of the wheels until she walked around to the front of the stroller to pick up
    her baby, and saw his bloody foot! in still another incident, a baby was choking
    on a bonnet ribbon until an oncoming stranger alerted the mother. although manufacturers
    have vastly improved the safety of strollers, nothing is safer than a mother''s
    constant view of her baby. besides, do you really think the baby knows the difference
    between traveling forward or backward? deanne dingley, portland, ore.'

    your reply to "smokeless in arizona," who wanted to send her ailing mother out

    her dream house, hair on her precious carpets from playful puppies, or a friend''s

    i have enjoyed your columns for many years. my late husband, the heavyweight boxing

    of letters about the amounts charged for a baby''s delivery. jack told me that
    a midwife delivered him in manassa, colo., on june 24, 1895, for 25 cents! jack
    was an inspiration to so many young athletes. he rose to the top of his field
    despite many obstacles, and continued to set a shining example for the youth of

    "elderly but able," the man who claims that he has been driving for 70 years and
    never had an accident, is to be commended. but it doesn''t necessarily mean that
    he is a good driver. it may mean that other drivers have quick reflexes. i see
    drivers tootling along, totally oblivious to the havoc they leave behind them.
    they think they are doing just fine. abby, the "55-alive mature driving course"
    is great, and it does teach one to compensate for changes in eyesight and slowing
    reflexes, but it has its limits. why should the gentleman write asking for a "neutral
    panel" to decide whether he should give up driving? aren''t his children neutral
    enough-or does he suspect they want him to quit driving so they can have his car?
    i am 72, and when my daughters ask me to stop driving, i hope i will be able to
    accept the fact that they do it because they care about me and the other people
    on the road. ruth clemmons, a 55-alive veteran in florida attention, women: if

    oh, brother-here we go again. another increase in u.s. postage! has it been only
    four years since the last one? don''t you think it''s outrageous to charge 32
    cents to send a letter? i can remember when you could get a postcard for a penny!
    i considered protesting the hike in postage by delivering my local mail personally,
    so i got in the car and drove 15 miles to our utilities payment center. as i was
    standing in line waiting to pay, i thought about how i had just spent $1.26 for
    gas and an hour of my time; so next time, i''ll just put a 32-cent stamp on it
    and drop it in the mailbox. then i called the airlines and asked how much i''d
    have to pay for a round-trip ticket to deliver this letter to you in person. the
    price ranged between $600 and $900-so i thought i''d put a 32-cent stamp on it

    please alert your readers to a kitchen hazard that never would have occurred to
    me until this happened: i purchased a unique, hand-crafted oven mitt that was
    a real complement to my kitchen decor. there was no fabric label on it. i recently
    used it to remove an extremely hot cast-iron pan from the oven, and the oven mitt
    stuck to the pan! in my panic, i yanked the pan all over the oven and almost spilled
    the contents on myself. when i was able to remove the pan from the oven and free
    my hand, i realized that my beautiful new oven mitt was made of a synthetic material
    that had melted from the heat and had become welded to the pan! the pan will never
    be the same, but it''s a small price to pay for the lesson. it isn''t necessary
    for an oven mitt to be a conversation piece, but it should be made of cotton or
    some other heat-resistant material. in examining a number of oven mitts and pot
    holders in my kitchen, i couldn''t find the fiber content on any of them. is this
    something for the department of consumer affairs to look into? ann sherman james,

    ted and i have been living together for several years. we are both divorced. our
    children are grown and have successful careers. we live in my house, and he gives
    me a generous check each month toward household expenses. ted pays for everything
    when we eat out. i pay for groceries. (i love to cook, so this is no small expense.)
    i pay the cleaning woman and, since i own the house, i am responsible for all
    repairs and maintenance. here''s my problem: ted is dead set against marriage.
    we never discuss the future, and if i try to, he changes the subject. he is very
    secretive about his financial situation, but i have told him everything about
    mine. i''m perfectly willing to sign a prenuptial agreement, but this makes no
    difference to ted. i know he loves me and doesn''t want to lose me. i love him,
    too, but i''m increasingly resentful of his attitude that i should be content
    with things as they are. i work very hard at our relationship and to make our
    lives comfortable. am i wrong to want the ultimate commitment? or should i be
    content with what i have? wants a future'

    recently my husband had serious throat surgery, which resulted in a somewhat deeper
    and huskier voice. this has been traumatic for him, but his strong will and perseverance
    have enabled him to continue his teaching profession. the most painful part of
    his recovery has been coping with insensitive remarks made by acquaintances who
    have known him for years. some examples: "what''s wrong with your voice?" "you
    sound strange." "do you have a cold?" such questions make my husband feel "defective."
    his self-esteem is wounded. can you suggest a response my husband might use when

    on a recent trip to ireland, i had the pleasure of staying at a hotel in galway
    where a wedding reception was taking place. our tour guide told us about the custom
    regarding wedding invitations: two sets of invitations were sent. one, which included
    dinner, went to close friends and relatives. the other was sent to friends to
    come later and enjoy dancing and wedding cake. we thought that was a wonderful
    idea, since the cost of weddings is so outrageous these days. nothing was said
    about wanting gifts . . . and if someone felt he had to bring a gift, it was a
    token one. isn''t it interesting the different way we americans think about things?
    always complaining and untrusting. maybe we need to be somewhat poorer in monetary
    things, and richer in friends. sue egan, bethlehem, pa.'

  body: 'dear readers: can you believe it! it''s st. valentine''s day-already! and
    what better time to revive my ten commandments of love? yes, dear readers, i actually
    had the chutzpah to write my own ten commandments. originally, i wrote two sets
    of commandments, one for men and one for women. then, mandy stillman, a lawyer
    and early feminist from milwaukee, wrote to demand equal rights for women, insisting
    that there be only one set of commandments. she was right, of course. so how''s
    this for a gender bender? the ten commandments of love - put your spouse before
    your mother, your father, your son and your daughter-your mate is your lifelong
    companion. - do not abuse your body with excessive food, tobacco, drink or any
    foreign substance that goes into your arm or up your nose. - remember that cleanliness
    is a virtue. - permit neither your business nor your hobby to make you a stranger
    to your children; the most precious gift a parent can give his or her family is
    time. - willingly share all of your worldly goods with your mate. - do not forget
    to say, "i love you." even though your love may be constant, your spouse needs
    to hear those cherished words often. - remember that the approval of your spouse
    is worth far more than the adoring glances of a hundred strangers, so be true
    to him or her, and forsake all others. - keep your home in good repair, because
    out of it comes the joys of old age (not to mention its resale value!). - forgive
    with grace, because who among us does not need to be forgiven? - honor the lord
    your god every day of your life, and your children will grow up and bless you.
    today, be a sweetheart. call someone you love and say, "i love you." (make two
    or three calls; who says you can''t love more than one person-in different ways,
    of course.) go through your closets and give all those clothes you''ve been saving
    until you lose 10 pounds to your favorite charity. call someone who''s lonely
    and say, "i''m thinking of you." or, better yet, say, "i''ll be over tomorrow
    to take you to lunch, or to run some errands for you . . . or to give you a ride."
    visit a sick friend. say a prayer. donate some blood. adopt a pet. will your eyes,
    your kidneys and all your usable organs to someone who can use them after you''re
    gone. forgive an enemy. hug your teenager. write a fan letter. listen to a bore.
    pay your doctor. tell your parents you think they''re wonderful. spay your dog.
    neuter your cat. quit smoking. drive carefully. if you''re walking, watch where
    you''re going. and don''t wait until next year to be a sweetheart again. love,
    abby'

    he quit going to church several years ago. the only thing he cares about is his
    golf game. i don''t want a divorce, and he doesn''t care whether we get one or

    many years ago, i had surgery to enlarge my breasts. the procedure cost $3,000,
    and i suffered considerable pain. i never would have done it had i not been strongly
    encouraged by my husband-who is now my "ex." the problem i now face is the colossal
    nerve of folks who ask, "are they real?" or, "are they yours?" such remarks are
    equally rude whether they come from a lingerie saleswoman, a co-worker or a new
    acquaintance. abby, how should i answer? i would like to say, "yes, they are `real''
    and they are mine," but i hate to lie. any other answer would make it obvious
    that i do not want to answer because they are "altered" or "not real," which isn''t
    something i care to advertise. perhaps through your column, people might realize
    their curiosity can cause embarrassment. enhanced'

    i have recently learned that my father is currently having affairs (an old habit

    say something that will hurt her and possibly cause a divorce. my parents have

    you were right on the money when you advised the woman from new orleans to pack
    up her children and go visit her frail mother in michigan for christmas. may i
    relate an incident from my "been there" file? my only sister and her husband were
    both army nurses, so they moved around a lot. they had purchased a home in a new
    area, and my sister wanted very much to spend christmas there. my mother went
    early to help her prepare for the holiday, and my husband and i were to arrive
    a few days before christmas with our daughter, who was a year old. initially,
    my husband was "iffy" because "the weather might get bad." finally, he committed
    to go. the day we were to leave, he refused to budge. his excuses were the weather
    and the five-hour drive might bother his back. i packed up my daughter and prepared
    to go on my own, but he threw such a fit, i ended up staying home. well, my sister
    was devastated and my mother was crushed. my sister and her husband spent the
    following christmas with his family, as they had an "every other year" arrangement.
    well, three weeks later, they were both murdered in their own home by two monsters
    who thought they were physicians who would have drugs-or money for drugs! the
    woman from new orleans was correct in knowing that she would be missing something
    very special. i hope she moved heaven and earth to get to her mother''s side.
    abby, it has been nearly nine years since my sister''s death, and through all
    the horror and tragedy, missing what would have been a very special christmas
    is one of the biggest hurts. i have since divorced the control freak, and never
    again will i allow anyone to prevent me from doing what my heart tells me to do.

    abby, a divorced woman is called a "divorcee," so why can''t they think up a name

    in the interest of evenhandedness, here are my tips on how to get along with your
    mother-in-law-which were also printed at that time: 1. invite your in-laws over
    once in a while. (once a year is better than never.) 2. when you are invited to
    your in-laws'' home for dinner, offer to bring something, and also offer to help
    with the serving and cleaning up afterward. don''t act like a guest-you''re family.
    3. phone your mother-in-law to ask, "how are you feeling?" and make a little small
    talk. this shows that you are interested in her, which will help build a closer
    relationship. 4. if she has given you a gift, such as a sweater or a purse, be
    sure that she sees you wearing or carrying it at least once. 5. if your mother-in-law
    has given your children clothing, make sure they wear the clothes in her presence
    while they are still new and in good condition. 6. if perchance she has hurt your
    feelings, don''t let it fester and do not complain to your husband. say, "mom,
    you hurt me," then tell her why, so you can put the matter to rest. 7. don''t
    compete with her daughter if she has one. accept the fact that she''s apt to favor
    her own. (you will too if you have one someday.) 8. never repeat family gossip.
    and try not to listen to any. 9. make it a point to ask her for something-a recipe,
    for example. and after you have used it with good results, thank her for it. (knowing
    she has been helpful will make her feel wonderful.) 10. love her son, and take
    good care of him.'

    this is for "elderly but able, gainesville, fla."-the 70-year-old gentleman who
    didn''t want to give up driving his car, and thus his independence: please reconsider.
    why wait until you''ve hurt yourself or someone else? my beautiful 23-year-old
    sister, kim, was walking through a parking lot last spring when she was struck
    by a car traveling backward at high speed. it swerved, throwing her 10 feet farther
    into a guardrail. the 74-year-old man driving the car was disoriented and confused.
    he didn''t even know he had hit her and continued driving until he ended up in
    a storefront! kim was rushed to a hospital where her head was shaved and a hole
    drilled into her skull to relieve the pressure from swelling of her brain. the
    doctors told us she could die. thank god, kim survived. that was eight months
    ago. she now suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression. she also
    has short-term memory problems, and has lost her sense of smell. however, all
    is not grim. she continues to improve and recently became engaged. so to "elderly

    about small children who misbehave in public: several years ago, i witnessed this
    scene in a large supermarket in iowa. a mother (in her 20s) was at the checkout
    counter with a child who appeared to be about 4 years old. the woman was obviously
    pregnant, and was being hassled by her little boy who was nagging for a candy
    bar. after she refused him several times, the little boy hauled off and hit her
    in the stomach with his fist! then she said, "well, all right." i couldn''t believe
    my eyes when she actually bought that little brat a candy bar! i had trouble containing
    myself, but i turned to her and asked, "how old is your son?" "he''s 4," she said.
    i couldn''t help myself; i said, "well, if he were mine, he would never see 5."
    she glared at me as if i were some kind of monster, paid for her groceries, and
    huffed out. perhaps i''m more sensitive to poor public behavior in children because
    of the way my daughter and son-in-law handle their four children at family gatherings
    at public restaurants. the children are usually very well-behaved, but on those
    rare occasions when they misbehave, they are taken out of the area, given a little
    "applied" psychology and returned to the gathering. it may take two or three minutes
    until the pout turns to a smile, but it does turn! my hat is off to them and to
    all parents of youngsters who know how to apply psychology. dick johnson, great

    a plumber who cleaned out our laundry drain told me to put 40 to 50 gallons of
    liquid bleach down the drain before i left on my vacation. when he saw my shocked
    expression as i visualized carrying that many bottles, he said, "you might check
    with a pool company, and get the crystals instead." an hour before our departure,
    a neighbor who had a pool gave me two large scoops of chlorine crystals and some
    tablets. i pulverized the tablets and poured the mixture into the trap. i walked
    into the kitchen, turned on the faucet, and heard something that sounded like
    gunshots in the utility room! just then, my husband returned from a frustrating
    day at work. nothing had gone right, he was running late, and what had his wife
    done? yep, she had blown up the utility room! the smell of chlorine was overpowering,
    so i opened every window and turned on the fan. after a few minutes, i asked a
    neighbor to close up the house later, and we left. when we returned, i had a job
    on my hands cleaning off the ceiling. the floor was so thick with gunk i had to
    scrape it off with a putty knife, and it took industrial-strength cleanser to

    i would like to ask this widow how often she included her single friends in parties

    friends might appreciate being included? or, did she, like many married people,
    exclude singles in favor of couples? please don''t ignore your single friends;
    someday you may need them. instead of waiting for people to give to her, she should

    i''m married to an extremely domineering man. he wants to control my life from

    has one habit i cannot understand. he buys himself gifts and cards for holidays,
    and signs my name, as though i had sent them. last christmas, he bought himself
    a gift and had his secretary wrap it. the card enclosed read, "to sam, with all
    my love, (signed) mary." he put it under our tree and refused to tell me what
    it was. he spent days shaking it under my nose, saying, "i wonder what you got
    me . . . ha, ha!" on christmas morning, he made a big ceremony out of pretending
    to be surprised. when the family came over, he made a point of announcing, "look
    what my sweet mary got me!" on valentine''s day, there was a large envelope on
    the table marked "to my sweetie from mary." (i had already given him a gift and
    valentine card, and also prepared an extra-special dinner.) he asked, "isn''t

    my husband''s mother, at 87, has many health problems. she complains constantly
    and frequently runs to the neighbors, begging them to let her spend the night.
    after frantic phone calls from the neighbors, my husband and his sister confer
    with their mother and offer suggestions as to her long-term care. but they give
    up after she insists that: 1. she can take care of herself. 2. she will not allow
    any stranger to stay in her home with her for fear he or she will rob her. 3.
    she flatly refuses to move in with her daughter because of the potential loss
    of her freedom, and. . . 4. she is not ready for a nursing home. this leaves us
    reacting to emergencies from a distance (we live in another state), which is expensive
    and creates turmoil. my husband is disabled because of a serious heart condition,
    and the anxiety created by these events is taking its toll. abby, how do we convince
    this selfish woman she needs help and her neighbors should not be burdened continuously-and
    also that these repeated emergencies indicate that she must cooperate in the planning
    of her long-term care? when faced by similar situations with my parents, i made
    plans for their care and implemented them in spite of their objections. but my
    husband and his sister are afraid to act against their mother''s wishes, so we
    continue living with a sword over our heads. is there a solution? concerned daughter-in-law'

    i am a middle-aged man who started to lose my hair when i was in high school.

    did.) abby, you would not believe some of the questions people have asked me.
    for example, can you imagine a person asking an obese person: - "how long have
    you been obese?" - "does it bother you when people make jokes about obesity?"
    - "weren''t you terribly upset when you first noticed you were getting obese?"
    - "is anyone else in your family obese?" 1 "do you worry that your children may
    be obese, too?" abby, few people are so rude as to ask such questions, but if
    you substitute "bald" for "obese," you will have a sample of what bald people
    have to put up with. baldness, i can tolerate. rudeness, i cannot! bald in texas'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    on one page of prison life magazine, an inmate describes his favorite recipe for
    making pizza with crushed dorito chips. on another page, inmates learn how to
    exercise their arms in solitary confinement using buckets of water and heavy books.
    in a section called "pen pals," inmates try to woo long-distance companions in
    personal advertisements that often list parole dates and crimes not committed:
    "not a child molester or con man," wrote one attica prisoner, who conceded that
    he killed someone in "self-defense." and in another section, an advice columnist
    named "bubba" tells an inmate how to keep his cellmate from snoring. "kick him.
    get him to turn over on his fat gut. smack him every time he snores," bubba writes.
    "and if that don''t work, try pouring warm coca-cola down his nose. that''ll ream
    out his nasal passages like drano. he should get the message real quick." relaunched
    last year after going belly-up in a previous incarnation, prison life, billed
    as "the voice of the convict," is making some big noise in prisons throughout
    the u.s. the bimonthly magazine based in new york gives a down and dirty, no-holds-barred
    look at the criminal justice system and life behind bars-all from the inmates''
    perspective. there are regular features on in-cell cooking, pumping iron and general
    fitness. the magazine has a column on jailhouse lawyering, features both an inmate
    tattoo and a cellmate of the month, and publishes non-fiction articles, short
    stories, poems and dozens of letters from inmates nationwide. prison life comes
    at you with an attitude. the language is raw and full of inmate slang and profanity.
    the magazine''s editorial content is about as subtle as kidney punch. the magazine
    trashes the "drug war," mandatory sentencing for certain crimes, abusive correctional
    officers, inhumane prison conditions and the perception among many americans that
    most inmates are worthless animals who deserve to rot behind bars. prison life
    often profiles inmates who''ve made positive changes in themselves in the joint
    and convicts who fight for their rights, stand their ground, retain their dignity
    and never give in or get broken by "the system." the magazine also carries a heavy
    dose of the inmate''s unwritten code of conduct: keep your nose out of other people''s
    business, treat the other guy with respect, take responsibility for your actions
    and never, ever rat on anybody. a handful of prisons nationwide have banned recent
    issues of the magazine, saying it glorifies the outlaw culture, breeds inmate
    discontent and encourages insurrection. but most inmates-and some wardens-say
    prison life paints an accurate picture of life in the slammer and the need to
    expand, not cut, programs to educate and rehabilitate inmates. among prison life''s
    big fans: imprisoned mafia don john gotti, imprisoned native american activist
    leonard peltier and convicted los angeles gang-leader and author sanyika shakur
    (a k a "monster" kody scott). "we need the magazine," said karim abdullah, 42,
    who is serving a 35-year sentence for armed robbery at the south central correctional
    center in clifton, tenn. "it educates the public as to what''s really going on.
    inmates see what''s going on in other places. it helps us organize. no one is
    going to protect our interests except us." but sam pruett, warden at the medium-security
    james river correctional center in state farm in virginia, calls prison life "garbage."
    "it uniformly depicts correctional officers in a negative and denigrating light,"
    pruett said. "and it''s insulting to the typical inmate, who is better than what
    is portrayed in the magazine." despite the criticism, richard stratton, prison
    life''s editor-in-chief, says he''s not backing off. inmates need a voice, he
    says. the public needs to be set straight. "i''m not going to pull any punches,"
    says stratton, 49, who is often pictured in the magazine wearing a deep scowl.
    "prison is a profane place. it''s a place with gritty, harsh realities and that''s
    what i want the magazine to reflect." "we are taking a militant, adversarial role,"
    stratton adds. "we oppose the vengeful, lock-''em-up mentality. we don''t think
    the answer to america''s problems is to build more prisons." stratton knows what
    it''s like behind bars. the son of a golf professional who grew up in middle-class
    comfort in wellesley, mass., stratton was a high school wrestling champion who
    earned a sports scholarship to arizona state university. but it was the ''60s.
    stratton began growing his hair long and smoking pot. he soon lost interest in
    school and sports and began making weekend trips to mexico to smuggle marijuana
    back to the u.s. to sell to his college buddies. by the mid-''70s, stratton and
    a partner were organizing multimillion-dollar shipments of hashish from morocco
    and lebanon to the u.s. at the same time, stratton pursued an interest in writing,
    publishing several short-stories and magazine articles and developing a close
    friendship with writer norman mailer, whom stratton met while attending a writers
    seminar in provincetown, mass. stratton says he made and spent millions of narco-dollars,
    including purchasing a 4,000-acre horse farm in texas and a 600-acre spread in
    maine, both of which had huge airstrips and were used in his drug smuggling operations.
    after a 15-year run, stratton was busted in 1982 and sentenced to 25 years in
    prison. he spent eight years in the penitentiary before getting his sentence commuted
    by an appeals court judge who ruled that his sentence was too harsh. turning to
    writing shortly after being paroled, stratton published his first novel, "smack
    goddess," about women drug dealers, and went to work editing a newsletter for
    the new york city-based fortune society, a non-profit group that helps ex-offenders.
    he also married kim wozencraft, a former texas narcotics cop turned writer who
    spent a year in a federal penitentiary on a felony conviction. stratton joined
    prison life as its editor in january of 1994, about a year after it was founded
    by joe strahl, a former tavern owner and commissary employee at illinois'' danville
    correctional center. even then, the magazine was in deep trouble. prison life
    had only about 1,000 paid subscribers and was hemorrhaging money. the magazine
    primarily published profiles of celebrity inmates, including charles manson, and
    reprinted articles from other publications. there was little original reporting
    or input from inmates. last year, strahl''s financial backers pulled the plug
    and prison life folded. but stratton found new deep-pockets-including some wealthy
    ex-cons-who were willing to subsidize the publication. since stratton published
    his first issue last june, the magazine''s paid circulation has climbed to nearly
    20,000, and stratton said he expects prison life to break even by the end of 1995.
    a typical issue is about 100 pages, with a glossy cover, a lot of gritty photographs
    and plenty of tough-guy quotes. the key to the magazine''s revival: improved editorial
    content and aggressive marketing. "joe (strahl) didn''t have the experience from
    the prisoner''s point of view," stratton said. "none of the editors or writers
    had experience in prison." stratton decided that for the magazine to make it among
    the nation''s 1.5 million inmates-for it to ring true-prison life had to be written
    primarily by cons or ex-cons. he also decided that prison life needed an edge-that
    it couldn''t just publish stories about life behind bars but needed to become
    an advocate for inmates. stratton, wozencraft and executive editor chris cozzone,
    a former humboldt park resident and gang member who managed to avoid prison, immediately
    plugged into a network of established prison writers. they also used the magazine
    to solicit articles, poems, paintings and story ideas from inmates to build a
    stable of regular contributors. for its march 1995 edition, cozzone put together
    a story about the influence of gangs in prison from more than 200 letters and
    writings submitted by inmates. the same issue features a special section titled
    art behind bars, featuring the best of the more than 1,000 poems, 400 essays and
    short-stories, 125 works of art and 25 plays submitted by inmates. outlet for
    creative energies "i want to give a forum for inmates'' creative energies," stratton
    said, explaining that feodor dostoevsky, herman melville, jack london and oscar
    wilde are just a few of the great writers who spent time in jails. "i wrote when
    i was in prison. prison promotes introspection. you start to examine your life.
    you discover things about yourself that you avoided on the street." alex friedmann,
    who is serving a 20-year sentence for armed robbery and attempted murder, sent
    in several entries to prison life''s poetry contest. friedmann, who spends at
    least four hours a day writing, says the magazine''s promotion of inmate art helps
    break down the stereotype that all convicts are uneducated thugs. "not all inmates
    are crack dealers or low-life scumballs," said friedmann, 25, who is incarcerated
    at the south central correctional center in rural tennessee. "there are many different
    types of people in prison with many different points of view. there are a lot
    of people in here like me who have educated themselves." recent issues of prison
    life include a profile of anthony papa, an accomplished painter who is serving
    15 years to life at new york''s sing sing correctional facility; an article by
    wozencraft describing the stigma of being an ex-con; and a cautionary tale by
    a former drug kingpin nicknamed ca$h, who is serving a life sentence and needs
    "an adding machine to count the number of friends i have dead or in prison." the
    magazine''s most popular feature is the column "ask bubba," a sort of "dear abby"
    for inmates. who is bubba? the magazine describes him as "your worst nightmare.
    he''s 270 lbs of tattoos and hairy beefcake, with that insane stir-crazy look
    in his eye." but bubba is also "cool. bubba''s been there. he''s done so much
    time in so many joints he''s the regular expert on how to do time," the magazine
    tells its readers. stratton says that prison life''s in-your-face style of journalism
    is the primary reason why the magazine is gaining a following among inmates. he
    says about 50 percent of the magazine''s subscribers are inmates, although most
    guys serving time can''t afford the $19.95 annual subscription. lawyers, prison
    activists, inmate family members, general readers with an interest in prisons
    and ex-cons make up the bulk of the remaining subscribers, though the magazine
    can be purchased at some newsstands and bookstores, including border''s at 830
    n. michigan ave. and tower records at 2301 n. clark st. "it''s popular (among
    inmates)," says nic howell, spokesman for the illinois department of corrections.
    "it''s entertaining. that''s what the whole idea is. but i don''t give it great
    social significance." contender for leadership that kind of attitude ticks off
    stratton. stratton wants to be a player in this country''s debate on crime and
    punishment. to boost circulation and increase the magazine''s visibility, stratton
    sent 50,000 free copies of prison life to correctional officers, deputy sheriffs
    and other members of the american correctional association. tens of thousands
    of free copies also were mailed to defense attorneys and law enforcement officials
    nationwide. the response was generally nasty, at least among prison brass. one
    corrections officer wrote a letter to the editor warning prison life editors "to
    remove my name from your mailing list or i''ll kick your ass." several other published
    letters called the magazine "vulgar," "garbage," "political propaganda," and worse.
    stratton and cozzone fear that wardens opposed to the magazine''s editorial line
    will try to ban the publication from their prisons-or limit the access of prison
    life reporters who are not living behind bars. howell of the illinois department
    of corrections recently turned down cozzone''s request to visit the stateville
    and joliet prisons to write about gangs because he thought it would incite gang
    activity. and a number of prisons have banned certain issues of the magazine because
    officials deemed it a "security risk." the california department of corrections
    confiscated prison life''s october 1994 edition because it published a wire-service
    story about an inmate who escaped from a virginia jail by braiding together dental
    floss into a cord to scale an 18-foot wall. stratton strongly denies that prison
    life encourages insurrections or escapes and says his buddy, defense attorney
    william kunstler, has agreed to file lawsuits against any prison or jail that
    fails to give a legitimate reason for banning the publication. stratton also remains
    bullish about the magazine''s future. "there are a lot of good people in prison,"
    says stratton. "i want the magazine to help inmates make positive changes in their
    lives. i want to help them break the cycle of crime and make them productive members
    of society." ---------- for subscription information, write to prison life, 505

    my daughter, "alice," is being married in six weeks. four family members are coming
    from out of town to attend and will be staying with me. they are my parents and
    two of my closest sisters. the groom''s parents, "mildred" and "alfred," are hosting
    the rehearsal dinner. alice advised mildred that her grandparents and aunts would
    be coming to the dinner. mildred said "no." i then offered to pay for their dinners,
    but she still refused. alice and her fiance tried to reason with mildred, explaining
    that they could not tell the relatives they were uninvited, but she still said
    "no!" i see no logical reason for this decision, but there has been a continuous
    struggle with mildred from the start. i have read a few etiquette books, and they
    all say that out-of-town guests should be invited. my husband and i are extremely
    upset, to say the least. my first reaction was to tell alice that either we would
    bow out of the dinner, or we''d make our own reservations, invite my family and
    be responsible for our own expenses. our daughter became very upset and begged
    us not to make a scene. she wants us to just attend and say nothing. how should
    this be handled, abby? frustrated bride''s mother'

    what do you do when a former spouse dies? do you go to the funeral, stay home,
    send flowers-or what? this can be a dilemma when you have had children with the
    former spouse and all live in the same town. my friend "anita''s" former husband
    was given four months to live. he informed his children that he did not want to
    see their mother during the time of his illness. anita wants to attend the funeral
    to support her two sons, both over 40. what should she do? another example: my
    husband''s former wife, "faye," is terminally ill. "pat" and faye had a 10-year
    marriage, three children and a bitter divorce. he has a good relationship with
    the children. pat and faye have a nodding relationship. pat thinks he should attend
    faye''s funeral out of respect for his children. i''m not too crazy about the
    idea and need some advice. should i go to the funeral with him, or should i stay
    home? should he go with his children? should we both stay home, and send a card?
    how can this be handled with good taste, so no one is offended? please don''t

    my husband, "yuri," came here from russia six years ago. we have been married
    for five years. yuri speaks excellent english. he has mentioned several times
    that it would be a good idea for me to learn russian, but with two small children
    under 4, learning russian has not been a high priority for me. the problem is
    that yuri has many russian friends, mostly professional people who speak english
    very well. but when they come to visit, they speak in russian, and i am left out.
    last sunday, "natasha" came over. i served cookies and coffee and tried to be
    a good hostess. she directed all her conversation to yuri. when i asked her about
    her children and her job, she gave me brief answers in english, then turned to
    yuri and continued speaking to him in russian. i realize she''s yuri''s friend.
    i''m not jealous of her, nor do i suspect they are having an affair. i just think
    it''s very rude of her to ignore me when she''s here. abby, it''s not only natasha.
    it has gotten to the point that when his russian friends come over, i go to our
    bedroom and watch tv by myself. it''s the same when we go to natasha''s house-or
    sergei''s or ilona''s. their husbands and wives all speak russian, and i''m left
    to play with the children. when i tell yuri how i feel, he says it is much easier
    for them to express themselves in russian than in english. i have decided to learn
    more russian, but what do i do in the meantime? should i insist they speak in
    english so i can understand them-or what? fed up in canada'

    your answer to the woman who refused to watch a porn movie with her husband in
    a motel was a bit flip. speaking as a mere man, it occurs to me that the woman
    might have some problems. most so-called "porn" movies that you can rent in motels
    usually involve nothing more than sex between a man and a woman. is sex between
    a man and a woman always porn? since the wife considered it such, i suspect she''s
    a little inhibited. (i noticed that she couldn''t bring herself to say that her
    husband wanted sex. she had to use the euphemism "get affectionate.") maybe she''s
    one of those women whose mother told her that sex is dirty. and maybe, out of
    desperation, her husband thought a sex movie might stimulate her. instead, she
    was turned off by the "dirty" movie. since she considered the porn movie degrading
    to women, is it possible she considers sex between a man and his wife degrading
    to the wife? if so, she''s got a problem. was he pouting, as you suggested? or
    was he withholding conversation, which his wife enjoyed, as she was withholding
    sex-which he needed and enjoyed? and how come he''s wrong to withhold what she
    wanted, but it''s ok for her to withhold what he wanted? i think your answer skipped
    quite a few possibilities. a mere male in milwaukee'

    what do you do about guests who always arrive 30 to 60 minutes early-regardless

    me into my kitchen, talk constantly and try to help me, which i find distracting
    and irritating. i always ask them to please go into the den and wait. they refuse,
    and remain in the kitchen. i asked a relative recently (another guest) to "remind
    the offenders that they weren''t expected until 7:30 p.m., because we had plans
    before." they replied they''d come when it suited them, as they didn''t have anything
    else to do. everyone i''ve talked to would prefer that guests arrive 30 minutes
    late rather than 30 minutes early. the wife of a college president was trapped
    in the kitchen in her slip when her husband answered the door and felt obligated
    to invite the early arrivals in. although they could see that preparations were
    still under way, they sat down and the host had to entertain them. perhaps we

    last summer i was diagnosed with breast cancer. by august i had had surgery and

    which would leave me temporarily bald, i should buy a wig ahead of time. i followed
    that advice and bought myself a very natural-looking wig made of human hair. abby,
    i hated it! i felt like i had a dead squirrel on top of my head. i then reasoned
    that a hairless head was nothing to be ashamed of, so why should i hide mine?
    now, when someone asks me about the chemo treatments and says, "is there anything
    i can do to help?" i answer, "yes, you could lend me a hat!" abby, it has been
    wonderful. i have a sherlock holmes hat, some gorgeous flowered chapeaux, fun

    a friend gave me these definitions of the various forms of government, and i thought
    you might want to share them with your readers: communism: you have two cows.
    the government takes both of them and gives you part of the milk. socialism: you
    have two cows. the government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. fascism:
    you have two cows. the government takes both cows and sells you the milk. nazism:
    you have two cows. the government takes both your cows, then shoots you. bureaucracy:
    you have two cows. the government takes both of them, shoots one, milks the other,
    then pours the milk down the drain. capitalism: you have two cows. you sell one
    of them and buy a bull. abby, what happens in a democracy? mrs. j. mcc.'

    to a weary group of clock-watchers. the experience that capped them all was the
    time i was asked to tell about my trip to europe. immediately after my introduction,
    one member jumped up and said, "i went there in 1948, and it was just wonderful
    . . ."; then she went on and on. the chairperson made no effort to interrupt her,
    although she kept glancing apologetically at me. i never did get to deliver my

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    while charles schulz sits at his table, pen in hand, drawing that wishy-washy
    charlie brown as he has for 45 years, an increasing number of comic-strip artists
    are flicking the on-switch of their computers, calling up stored images and electronically
    zapping them into a blank panel on the screen. as schulz finishes shadowing the
    curves in linus'' blanket the old-fashioned way, the computer-assisted artist
    is typing on a keyboard, and letters that mirror handwriting appear inside dialogue
    bubbles. after 100 years of the comics, things are changing. schulz still creates
    his world-famous "peanuts" in much the same way that strips were created at the
    turn of the century, but other cartoonists have gone the route of the rest of
    the newspaper, adopting new technologies to help them create and, for some, improve
    the product. purists may fear a world of artists who create on the screen, but
    just as new paints or brushes help artists, some comic-strip creators, such as
    bob thaves ("frank and ernest") and jeff macnelly ("shoe"), use new technology
    to enhance their work and communicate with readers. "there are some artists that
    will only give up that brush or that pen on the event of their death, and that''s
    the way it should be because that''s how that artist approaches his or her craft,"
    says lee salem, editor of universal press syndicate, a major comic-strip distributor.
    "but i also think there are other artists, given the greatly expanding capabilities
    of computers, who are going to find a good ally in computers. i think it might
    allow the art to become more fluid. (the technology) is still in its infancy;
    it''s rudimentary compared to what they are going to be able to do 10 years from
    now. "and if it gives the artists more time in other areas, i think that''s fine."
    thaves uses several computer techniques to enrich the look of his strip and to
    appeal to a generation that wasn''t born when the strip began two decades ago,
    says his daughter, sarah thaves. in his daily strips, thaves uses the computer
    to add shading to some of his drawings, and this month, sarah thaves says, a new
    color process will set his sunday strips apart from others. thaves says she and
    her father researched companies they could enlist to color the strips. they decided
    to team with electric crayon. formed less than a year ago in santa monica, calif.,
    electric crayon has made a quick name for itself in the comic-book world. "we
    like the people there because they are artists first," sarah thaves says. "there
    is always an open dialogue between dad and their creators, so everyone is satisfied
    with the results." instead of colors being processed at the printer, electric
    crayon creates the finished image on a computer disc and sends it to the printer.
    the color, much richer than a normal sunday comic, flows evenly like a painter''s
    brush stroke. when thaves finishes his six daily strips, he scans them electronically
    and sends them by modem to his syndicate, newspaper enterprise association. but
    because most comic-strip artists work far in advance, they send their originals
    or copies via overnight delivery. modems are used more often by editorial cartoonists
    who cover timely news events and work outside their newspapers, in their homes
    or studios. comics are usually sent from the syndicates to their newspaper clients.
    but a new company, reed brennan, has developed a pagination service, relieving
    some papers'' staffs of hours of cutting, pasting and laying out the comics page.
    reed brennan, based in winter park, fla., creates daily black-and-white comics
    pages for more than 20 u.s. newspapers. the finished product, which can include
    other syndicated pieces such as horoscopes or "dear abby," can be sent to the
    newspaper via e-mail or on disc, or the newspaper can access reed brennan''s system
    and download its files. and reed brennan soon may offer daily strips in color-once
    reserved for the sunday funnies-if enough newspapers express an interest. "coloring
    the comic strips is an intensive, manual-labor process," says timothy brennan,
    the company''s co-founder. "we''re exploring it, and if there is enough of a customer
    base, then we would like to provide it. we think it would be welcome." color is
    beginning to appear in a number of papers every day. the procedure for coloring
    daily comics, which the newspapers handle themselves, is new and has had its share
    of problems, including a purple dinosaur coming out green and a red-headed woman
    appearing as a blond. the ethics of recycling another technological advance in
    the comic world is the electronic recycling of stored images. instead of drawing
    the same character every day, an artist can save it as a computer file, then recall
    an old image that correlates to a new piece of dialogue. sarah thaves says her
    father still prefers to draw his characters by hand, but he has stored hundreds
    of his characters in different poses so he can use them in future strips if he
    desires. "i think dad will always resist using any computer entirely," she says.
    "he still likes the feel of pen to paper." macnelly also has begun to use stored
    images in his strips. schulz and mort walker ("beetle bailey") prefer to keep
    drawing the same images over and over because they say their work is always evolving
    and improving. "using repetitive art is not new," schulz says. "there have been
    people who used to make prints of their work and paste them. i suppose it can
    be a dangerous trend because it keeps your work from progressing, and i think
    that any of us who are really earnest about our work are trying to draw our characters
    better each day with a result that they look different week to week, month to
    month." once electronic image-recycling becomes commonplace, will comic strips
    still be considered an art form? for decades comic-strip artists have fought to
    gain recognition as artists. walker, who has been drawing "beetle bailey" since
    before the korean war, says he had to go to court to prove his work was art. "i
    had about three- or four-thousand drawings in my collection, and i began giving
    them away to some universities," walker says. "i took a tax deduction for them,
    and they (the irs) wouldn''t accept it. they said they were worthless. i sued
    them for a refund, and proved that they had value and were art." to preserve the
    art, walker has helped found the international museum of cartoon art in boca raton,
    fla., a 26,000-square-foot showcase for some of the best work in comics and other
    forms of cartooning. part of the museum will open in november, with the official
    opening in february 1996. walker says comics will survive, regardless of what
    technology is invented to aid the artists. "they will always be with us because
    we need a release from the tragedies on the earlier (news) pages," walker says.
    "i think we need our lives interpreted, and i think cartoonists have done that
    from the beginning. "that''s why comics go up on our refrigerator doors and on
    office bulletin boards. because they have meaning for our lives." belly laughs
    on the internet a less controversial advance in the world of comics is on-line
    computer services to communicate with readers. on may 7, america online will begin
    the first in a series of live sunday night chats between comic-strip artists and
    readers. the first scheduled artist is walker, and readers will be able to question
    not only him, but beetle, sarge or any of his peacetime army crack-ups as well.
    worthy press and tribune media services are two syndicates that are taking on-line
    communication a step further. "happily ever after," the first and only client
    for fledgling worthy press, is the first strip to be marketed for newspapers and
    for on-line services, says greg brooks, president of worthy press. "if a paper
    wants to pay the syndication fee, which is in line with what a paper would pay
    for a print edition, we give them the strip in electronic form, in whatever format
    they need to post it on their on-line version," brooks says. brooks founded worthy
    press in midway city, calif., a few months ago to syndicate "happily ever after,"
    a strip written by his wife, diane. a web site is already in place for the strip,
    and primarily it will be a place for fans to hang out and communicate. "we will
    also run archives of the strip in one-week chunks, about two weeks after they
    have run elsewhere," brooks says. "we do not want to be in direct competition
    with our client newspapers. the web site will also include bios of the characters,
    and a letter from the artist." a new version of an old strip, "terry and the pirates,"
    also will include similar in-depth material for readers, says mike silver, vice
    president of editorial and development for tribune media services. "we won''t
    be putting the strip on a computer screen," silver says. "we are creating terry''s
    world on the internet in addition to being in the newspaper, so there will be
    material that doesn''t appear in the strip but that relates to it." silver says
    tms plans to find other on-line companion pieces to other comics, rather than
    rerunning the same strips that are available in the daily paper. in addition tms
    runs a variety of comics on-line. "it''s a best-of a number of strips rather than
    the same ones that appear in the paper every day," silver says. "the reason is
    we believe that comics are something special for newspapers. this is the only
    art form that is unique to newspapers, created just for newspapers." illustration

    whenever i have a holiday dinner for family, my mother-in-law causes a problem.
    there are usually from eight to 15 people seated at my dining room table. everyone
    knows that my husband always sits at the head of the table, and i sit at his right.
    this seat is convenient for me because i get up frequently. when called to dinner,
    my mother-in-law asks me where she should sit, and i tell her to sit "anywhere,"
    but i sit here because i need to be close to the kitchen. i am the last one to
    sit down, of course, and more than once i have found that my mother-in-law is
    in my chair. i don''t want to be rude by asking her to move, and i don''t want
    to have any arguments, especially during a holiday dinner, so i take another seat
    and wind up at the far end of the table. abby, what do you suggest i do next time?

    i am a 68-year-old widow with grown children, all of whom have homes, careers
    (or businesses) and active interests. i am not wealthy, but i am financially independent
    and don''t need to ask family members to come over to repair things or take me
    places. what is driving me crazy is their lack of respect for my privacy. i have
    asked them several times to please phone me before dropping in. there are days
    when i don''t feel like getting dressed and prefer to read, watch tv or loaf all
    day. or perhaps i am entertaining my "significant other" who lives across town.
    when my family telephones me and i say i''m going out--or don''t feel like having
    company--they come anyway! this irritates me, especially when my bed isn''t made,
    there are dirty dishes in my sink, and my hair is in rollers. is it asking too
    much to insist on a phone call? this popping-in business not only infuriates me,
    it drives my blood pressure up. now that this is off my chest, i feel better already.

    i had to write when i read your answer to "mourning in fresno," whose son had
    died. she wondered what to say when people asked her how many children she had,
    and you suggested she count only the living one. if "mourning" had lost her only
    child, would your answer have been the same? for her to say, "i have no children"
    would not only deny her son''s life, it would also deny what she had been for
    half of her life--a mother to that child. a bereaved parent would feel guilty
    and disloyal failing to count the child who has died. "mourning" would probably
    feel better if she replied, "i raised two sons." then she could add a few remarks
    about her living son, steering the conversation in that direction. eventually,
    she will feel more comfortable talking about the son who has died. in the two
    years since our daughter''s death, the wonderful people at compassionate friends
    have helped us to face this question and many others. i hope "mourning" can find
    a chapter of this support group in her area. sandee mcalpine, cincinnati'

    i have been a faithful reader of your column for many years. i felt i must write
    to you concerning your response to the 15-year-old girl signed "sorry." she was
    in her seventh month of pregnancy, the baby''s father was seeing another girl,
    and she said the only person who had treated her "halfway decent" was the nice
    lady at planned parenthood. while the girl''s story certainly serves as a sad
    example of the moral state of our society, i find it hard to understand why you
    did not take her at her word when she stated her purpose in writing was to "convince
    other young girls to say no to sex until they get married." she did not ask you
    for advice, and it seems obvious to me that, considering the fact that the planned
    parenthood federation is the largest provider of abortions in the world, the "nice
    lady" who befriended her there has already taken care of her little problem. this
    is, of course, a tragedy since an innocent infant has been murdered. but your
    endorsement of this organization is also tragic. i hope to god i am mistaken--that
    she is still pregnant. however, if this is the case, your suggestion about her
    contacting a "state agency" about child support is laughable. don''t you realize
    that, considering her story, her chances of collecting child support are literally
    nonexistent? please, think before offering a minor in dire straits such silly
    advice. thomas m. d''alessandro, stratford, n.j.'

    i told her to get out of my face. when she wouldn''t let up, i told her she was

    had gathered, and some were daring me to get up and fight! i wasn''t fully aware

    me with her dukes up, ready to hit me again. i instinctively raised my hands as
    if to say "enough"--when she hit me again and broke my nose! realizing she might
    seriously injure me if this continued, i said, "i''ve had enough!" incredibly,

    i must disagree with your response to the lady in tampa whose boxer was attacked
    by a rottweiler. i own one and find it most distressing that this breed is preferred
    by people infatuated with its reputation as a "killer" dog. they deliberately
    mistreat these good-natured puppies and teach them to be aggressive and vicious.
    people who do this to animals should be stopped. one way to do it is by calling
    the police or the local animal control agency when an attack occurs. even if no
    action is taken against the owner, at least the dog goes on record as a vicious
    animal. you are correct, abby, that the dog owner should pay the vet bill. but
    do you suppose there''s any chance of that happening with no intervention from
    the authorities? the woman in tampa doesn''t have to prove the dog was released
    deliberately; the fact that it was loose and it attacked is sufficient. depending
    on local laws, the owner may be in violation of a leash law and may have to produce
    documentation of current vaccinations and a license. most important, the attack
    becomes a matter of record. even if "tampa" cannot recover her vet bill, please
    advise her to pursue the matter to the end. there''s a potentially dangerous animal
    in the hands of an immature, foolish and mean-spirited man, and the next victim
    may not be as lucky as tampa and her boxer. rottweiler lover in oregon'

    as a physician assistant in a pediatric office, i read with interest the letters
    concerning long waits in waiting rooms. you correctly pointed out the possibility
    of emergencies as contributing to these long waits, but may i suggest some other
    factors that frequently are involved? johnny is at the office being seen for an
    earache. he is accompanied by his father and his sister. after johnny is examined
    and treated, dad casually asks, "could you look at susie''s ears, too? she''s
    had a cold for several days." it may seem to dad that this will take little or
    no extra time. but if susie is really sick, it means finding her chart, writing
    another clinical note, weighing her to be sure of the correct dosage, and writing
    another prescription. then there are the parents who call for an appointment for
    one child, and call back an hour later asking to fit in a sibling. also, there
    are patients who arrive 10 to 15 minutes late, thereby setting the entire schedule
    back. abby, i agree that when doctors are running behind, someone should inform
    the waiting patients of the situation. however, people need to understand that
    sometimes their own actions are partially responsible for the problem. marilyn

    said to his dying brother, "it''s hard for me to say the words, but you know i
    love you, don''t you?" ken replied, "if the words are hard, just say something

    that, greg would say "green pigs," and his brother would giggle. after a while
    greg said, "you know, ken, i think it''s easier to just say i love you than to
    say `green pigs.'' " ken''s response was simply, "of course." as he faced death
    at the age of 34, ken had learned a valuable lesson and passed it on to his brother:

    had been living with my family after the death of her parents. when her condition

    placed for adoption. after the ordeal was over, jessie went to live with other
    relatives. she never saw our baby girl. although my parents were deeply hurt and
    disgraced by ugly gossip, they were also forgiving and loyal. i was so consumed
    by self-loathing and guilt that when jessie was in the maternity home, i considered
    suicide. thankfully i received help, and went to college and later married a good
    woman with whom i have four children. a few days ago i received a hysterical letter
    from jessie telling me the young woman had located her and also plans to contact
    me! she told her the circumstances of her conception and begged her to leave us
    alone for everyone''s sake. our daughter told jessie that a medical history was
    not enough; she wants to know her blood relatives. i have worked hard to redeem
    myself, and have always wanted to spare my wife my past mistake--it would devastate

    you recently had a letter from a lady in tampa, asking for advice when her dog

    be difficult to prove that the rottweiler''s owner deliberately released the dog,
    but the owner should pay the vet''s bill. abby, do you really think that any idiot
    who deliberately releases his dog to attack another will pay the bill? at the

    custom centered around the bride and groom pretending to feed each other a bite
    of wedding cake--then smearing each other''s faces with the cake and icing! recently
    i attended the wedding of a fellow employee. the waitress brought a cake covered
    with whipped cream. the bride began to feed the groom a piece of cake, then she
    pressed the whipped cream up his nose! everyone thought it was hilarious. i thought

    how does one calculate a wedding anniversary? is it the number of years two people
    have been married to each other? or can it be the total number of years a person
    has been married to one, two and possibly three mates? this is not a gag, abby.
    let me explain: my wife and i are both in our 70s, and neither of us is in the
    best of health. my wife was widowed twice. i lost only one mate after having been
    married to her for 21 years. my wife recently realized that with more than 48
    years of being married, she has never celebrated a 25th anniversary. to reach
    that point together, we have several years to go--and may not make it. however,
    if we add up all her married time, we will reach 50 years of marriage in 1996.
    is this an anniversary? can we celebrate with a party? going for the gold'

    problem: i find him very unattractive without his beard. i know this may seem
    shallow, but as time has passed he has lost much of his curly hair, and he also
    now possesses a very prominent double chin. the loss of his beard exaggerates
    both. the other issue with the beard is that it has always been a bone of contention

    my wife and i bought a house last year, and we are building an addition onto it.
    i have been working on it during the day, and some nights, too. i used to go to
    the gym about two days a week for two or three hours. my wife complained that
    i wasn''t home enough, so i asked her to go to the gym with me. she refused, so
    i stopped going, too. she spends a lot of time watching television. when i try
    to talk to her, she hushes me up so she can hear the tv, so i go and do more work
    on the house. sitting around watching television and drinking beer is not my idea
    of spending time with my wife. i have offered to take her out to dinner, but that
    didn''t work either because she would have to miss one of her television programs.
    we don''t have children yet, although we hope to have some, but she isn''t working
    very hard on that either. can you help me? needs advice'

    i have a real problem. my husband and i decided to breed our cocker spaniel last
    year. when sadie had her five puppies, we decided to keep a male we named ernie.
    well, ernie is now a little over a year old. males seem to mark their territory
    wherever they go, and that''s my problem. i have had numerous arguments with my
    husband because i insist we should get ernie neutered not only because of his
    urinating everywhere, including the house, but also to reduce the risk of cancer.
    my husband says he just can''t do that to his dog! he thinks ernie will lose his
    drive to play ball and walk all the time. he actually phoned the vet when he caught
    ernie urinating on the plant in our living room. then he canceled the appointment
    because he "just couldn''t do that to ernie." am i wrong to want to get our dog
    fixed before he wets the entire house? i love ernie, and i really don''t think
    he''s going to know the difference being neutered or not. ernie''s mom in clearwater,
    fla.'

    recently, while shopping in a grocery store, i saw a boy of about 7 with his mother.
    he took a handful of the bulk jelly beans from the candy jars and shoved them
    into his mouth. his mother saw him and didn''t say a word. another time, i saw
    two teenaged girls eating candy from the same jars. isn''t this stealing anymore?
    should i have reported the kids to management, or told the kids that this is stealing?
    or should i have kept my mouth shut? abby, how far should a stranger go in disciplining
    a stranger''s child? bob mitchell, dixon, calif.'

    i am an african-american female, and i wear my hair in rows of tiny braids. it
    seems as if every time i go out, someone (usually not of african-american heritage)
    asks me questions about my hairstyle--such as, "do you braid it every day?" i
    explain that i can leave my hair in braids for six months. then they ask me, "can
    you wash your hair?" abby, i am sick and tired of answering that ignorant question!
    it amazes me that anyone would think that i wouldn''t wash my hair for six months!
    yes, i wash and blow-dry my hair often. perhaps after a few people read this,
    they will think before asking if one can wash her hair while wearing braids. b.c.

    with microwave ovens so popular today, you would do your readers a great service
    by answering the following questions. i notice people opening the oven door without
    stopping the cooking process. is this ok, or is it dangerous? my husband thinks
    we should not only wait until the cycle is complete, but also wait until the beeping
    stops before opening the oven door. is he correct? also, is it true that it''s
    dangerous to stand in front of a microwave oven during its operation? chris k.
