    i am a frequent international traveler with a problem. i always pack food for
    myself to take onboard. my trips are often 20 hours or longer and involve several
    planes. i find many people neglect to pack any food and they wind up asking --
    or begging -- me to give them some of mine. it''s very awkward for me. on one
    flight, i overheard a woman tell her son, "go ask that man for some cookies,"
    and the kid did come over. how do i handle this? there are times i have to spend
    five or seven hours in an airport after midnight waiting for the next flight,
    and that food is my reserve. -- not stingy in florida'

    we have some neighbors who recently bought a large parrot they keep in a cage
    in their backyard. this bird squawks so loudly we can hear it inside our home
    with the windows closed, and we are no longer able to enjoy our own backyard or
    patio. their yard is fenced in, so i haven''t met or even seen these neighbors.
    for the life of me, i cannot understand how someone could subject others to this
    kind of intrusion. it is so disrespectful. we can only assume the bird is kept
    outside so they don''t have to listen to its loud screeching inside their own

    what do you do with someone who has no manners? a relative of my husband''s has
    been dating a woman for more than a year. they are both in their 30s, and there''s
    a strong possibility they will marry. whenever a group of us get together to go
    out for dinner, on vacation or anywhere, she puts a damper on the entire event.
    she won''t converse (and it''s not because she''s shy), she never smiles, she
    just sits with her arms crossed and is absolutely miserable. she has been to our
    home for dinner on a couple of occasions. afterward she gets up from the table
    and never, ever, says please or thank you. she''s the most immature, self-centered,
    unpleasant human being i have ever met. even our children comment on her rudeness
    -- in addition to the group of people we go out with. she is even rude to my mother-in-law,
    but her boyfriend just doesn''t see it. they say that love is blind -- but that
    blind? it has reached the point that we don''t want to associate with this couple.

    a bridal tea is being held for my niece soon. the invitation says, "hats and dresses,

    they want everyone attending to wear hats. i told her i''m very uncomfortable
    wearing a hat, but would put flowers in my hair to "jazz it up" a bit. last night,
    my brother-in-law called asking what i was wearing to the tea. my first reaction
    was that he was joking -- so i asked if he thought that it was even worth a conversation.
    he said if i don''t wear a dress and hat, to not bother coming. i was so shocked

    the hat -- something so superficial. if appearances are more important than having
    me there, then i really don''t want to attend. i would, however, send a note and

    he would never do anything with this woman. however, i''m uncomfortable because
    he talks about her often, and she gives him free food just about every day and
    jokes around with him. if i have lunch with vic there, she won''t look at me.
    she and i used to talk often. i haven''t said anything to him about how i feel.

    i''m the mother of three sons. over the years, i would sometimes play rough and
    wrestle with them, all in good fun. now that they''re almost all grown and out
    of the house, i find myself getting carried away with this type of play with my
    spouse. he was on the wrestling team in school, so invariably i always lose. but
    he knows how to play without hurting me. is there something wrong with me for
    wanting to play so rough at times? he seems to enjoy it, but there have been times

    i''m married to the love of my life. my wife is a beautiful woman, 50 years old,
    in great shape and she looks 35. my problem is whenever we go out, if i ask her
    to wear something sexy for me, she always says, "i''m too old to dress like that"
    and refuses. however, when she dresses for work, she spends hours on her appearance
    and dresses very sexy. i have told her it bothers me, but she says i''m being
    silly and she just wants to look good for her management job. she''s constantly
    buying new outfits for work. this morning she left wearing a sexy short miniskirt
    and boots. she is an independent woman who does what she wants. i don''t spend
    my time trying to control her by any means. i trust her and seriously doubt there''s
    another man. but i feel this is a matter of her not respecting my feelings as

    i am 18 and will be graduating in may of next year. because i have always done
    well in school, my family expects me to go right off to a big-league college.
    abby, i want to go to college, but not right away. (i am also not too fond of
    staying in dorms.) i want to be a zoologist, and plan on going to school for it,
    but i feel that my family is rushing me into college because they expect it of
    me. when i tell them my other interest is hairstyling, and i may want to take
    a year off to do that to save up money, they put me down and compare me to my
    successful college cousins. i want my family to be proud of me because i have
    worked hard in school. i only wish they would be just as proud of me if i maintained
    a nice job for a few years and then went to college. (i have been told if i choose
    that path, i will never go to college and i''ll never make good money.) they also
    blame my not wanting to go to college right away on my boyfriend of two years.

    about it the next day, she became upset because she thought it was inappropriate
    for an adult to be in the tub with her young daughter. my daughter''s mother-in-law

    a housewife who takes care of his mother who lives with us (another story). i
    can''t go anywhere. i''m at home all day, every day, except when his mother needs
    to go to the doctor. he refuses to get another car because he''s "afraid" i''m
    going to meet someone else if i go out. i''m at my wits'' end. howard doesn''t
    like my friends -- the three that i do have. he has taken church away from me
    because he believes a husband and wife should go to church together, and he doesn''t,
    therefore neither should i. he''s verbally abusive and manipulative. i feel i
    can''t do anything right, and he proclaims to be a perfectionist. everything revolves
    around him and his likes, needs and wants. this is a second marriage for both
    of us. he admits that he''s insecure. i love him, but i can''t take this anymore.

    i''m 17 and hopelessly confused. i''m currently in a long-distance relationship
    with someone i haven''t seen in person for several months. at first, i wasn''t
    "into" him, but after we began talking over skype and emailing, he told me he
    liked me, so i said i liked him, too -- even though i''m not physically attracted
    to him. i figured that since he lives so far away and there''s no one at my school
    i could see myself liking, why make him feel bad by telling the truth? now he''s
    coming to visit for a few days, and i''m worried that i won''t like him. i''m
    his first girlfriend, and i think his parents are excited to see that he finally
    found someone. my mom tells me that he''s a very nice boy and won''t leave me
    like the rest of my egocentric exes. he''s just very immature and socially awkward.
    i thought i might eventually fall for him because he''s smart, motivated and sweet

    my recently divorced, beautiful, intelligent daughter, "glynnis," is an executive
    with a global firm and has a high net worth. during her divorce she reconnected
    with a high school friend who moved in with her. this "friend" is a jobless, obese,
    coarse man who has been divorced three times. glynnis uses him as an errand/houseboy,
    chauffeur, bodyguard, handyman and general flunky. he will do anything she asks
    of him at any time. one can only assume he thinks he has won the lottery. this
    man is an embarrassment of monumental proportions. we live in another state and
    go to visit them. i am extremely uncomfortable with the bizarre image of a couple
    they present. at lunch, dinner or out shopping with them, people actually gasp
    when they realize the two are together. i cannot relate to him. conversing with
    him is hopeless. of course, it''s my daughter''s business who she wants in her
    life. but i''m disgusted with the entire scenario. i don''t want to damage my

    my son is 24 and was honorably discharged as a corporal after a four-year enlistment

    my twin sister and i have lived across the country from each other for many years,
    but have remained close through phone calls. two years ago she began talking politics,
    and we realized we differ on the topic. i asked her if we could not talk so much
    about the subject and just "agree to disagree." things were fine until she planned
    a visit to see me and also a friend who agrees politically with her. i told her
    she was welcome to use my car to see her friend, but i didn''t want to go because
    i knew politics would be brought up. it made her very angry, and she ended up
    canceling her trip. we have continued our phone chats, and i stayed with her several
    days last year to celebrate our brother''s birthday. but the bond we had is no
    longer there. i can feel her and my brother pulling away from me. i''m sure it''s
    because of our political differences. i don''t know how to turn things around.
    i have never argued with them, but feel they are making me an outsider. how can
    i get them back without compromising my own views? twenty years ago, my sister
    and i differed on some religious points, and she wanted nothing to do with me

    "wants to do the right thing" (april 18) asked about using email to thank those
    who donated to a fundraiser for her son, who has bone cancer. what is wrong with
    that? i have been there. one of my twin boys was diagnosed with cancer at age
    2. i was grateful for all the help my family and friends gave me, but i did not
    always have the time or energy to devote to writing thank-you cards. you really
    have to have experienced this kind of long-term stress and trauma to understand.
    it takes all the strength you have to just get through each day without breaking
    down. for larger donations, i would write a card when i could or print some out
    on my computer. sometimes i recruited a friend or family member to handle thank-you
    notes. people always ask, "what can i do?" well, assign them this task! another
    way of thanking people was through a blog, like caringbridge. these free websites
    were a great way to keep in touch with people and let them know what was going
    on. i often posted general notes of thanks there, then emailed everyone who contributed
    with a link to the site. the truth is, it was difficult to accept charity and
    help from others, and i often found myself overwhelmed by the outpouring of love
    and support. -- truly thankful in new york'

    abby, i shouldn''t have to apologize for my new lifestyle. i worked hard to make
    a change for myself. what can i do? i really like her, but this is becoming difficult.
    an example: we went shopping last week. she bought only a gift she had to have
    for a birthday -- nothing for herself. i felt uncomfortable with my purchases,
    even though they weren''t extravagant. she made a comment to the effect that "it
    must be nice to be able to buy something so frivolous." i should mention that
    barbie''s parents are still willing to send her through college or a tech school,
    even at the age of 39, but she chooses not to make the effort. -- tired of feeling

    it seems that every other letter you print concerns a demanding relative (a parent,
    in-law, sibling, etc.). the writer always wants to know how to avoid unreasonable
    demands without causing "unpleasantness." may i say a word to these folks? be
    honest and admit that the relationship is already unpleasant. demanding people
    are impossible to please. they know their control over you depends on temper tantrums
    and/or fits of sulking and tears. they''ll pitch these fits regularly no matter
    how hard you try to please them. when faced with an unreasonable demand, just
    say "no." don''t waste time giving reasons or trying to work out a compromise.
    you already know it won''t do any good. then hunker down and wait for the explosion,
    keeping in mind that the longer you have been a doormat, the more violent and
    bitter the reaction will be. above all, do not be drawn into a fight! controlling
    people love to fight, and they are good at it. your weapon should be polite withdrawal.
    refuse meetings. screen your calls. ignore letters and emails unless they contain
    an apology and indicate a sincere desire for change. it may shock your domineering
    relatives into more reasonable behavior. if not, you haven''t lost a thing. you
    may even find that your life is less complicated without them. draw the line and
    let your family know that future relationships will be based on love and respect,
    or there will be no future relations. you won''t regret it. -- been there, done

    when i was a child, my mother -- a bipolar schizophrenic -- abused me. at 12,

    since then. a few years ago i wrote her a letter. in it i included pictures of
    my children, saying i would like her to know her grandchildren. she ripped the

    my sister has decided to let her 14-year-old son have a girlfriend. this is contrary
    to every value we grew up with as kids into adulthood. she has met the girl''s
    parents and says they "immediately clicked" and she knew right away that they
    share the same morals. the parents now set up situations where the two kids can
    get together. not only have my nephew and the girl bonded, but the parents have
    become fast friends. i see no problem with a little puppy love that happens in

    when kids are so young? what happens if they are eventually allowed to be alone?
    or one of them wants to break up but is afraid to hurt not only the other, but
    also the parents? my sister says she''s "guiding her son through his first romance."
    i say an eighth-grader is too young and she''s inviting a myriad of problems.

    "jerry," my husband, has been sending pictures of himself to online dating sites,
    advertising for a personal relationship with the so-called "right woman." i feel
    this is a betrayal of our marriage vows and that it''s cheating. he claims he''s
    "just looking" at what''s out there. my concern is, why is he looking in the first
    place? all i get from him is "i love you" and "i want to be with you." i have
    seen these dating sites, and i feel hurt and betrayed. am i wrong to feel this
    way, or should i believe what he says about harmless fun? -- broken-hearted libra,

    i was divorced 20 years ago and have two children from my marriage. my ex-husband
    was black and i am caucasian. over the years, when i''ve discussed my children
    or showed photos of them, people have asked me if they are "mixed," if they have
    the same father and if i was married to their father. i presume that some folks
    assume interracial marriage indicates a lack of good judgment, giving rise to
    further inappropriate questions. i would love a good, snappy comeback to those
    questions without stooping to their level of rudeness. i have tried, "why would
    you ask me that?" and got even more questions. any advice or help you could give
    would be great. -- taken aback in indiana'

    i just celebrated my 80th birthday at a party with 22 of my dearest friends. i
    also invited my daughter-in-law, "sydney," and her mother. the problem is, i didn''t
    invite my 8-year-old granddaughter. i explained that i felt she wouldn''t enjoy
    herself with all of us senior women. sydney disagreed. i then suggested perhaps
    it would be better if i had a dinner party for the entire family the following
    evening (on my actual birthday) at a fine dining restaurant. in retaliation for
    my not inviting my granddaughter, sydney declined the dinner invitation, although
    all other family members attended. my "punishment" was not to receive a birthday

    my sister-in-law, the only girl and the youngest of my husband''s siblings, is
    being married soon. we couldn''t be happier. the problem is my mother-in-law.
    anytime the subject of the wedding comes up and i chime in, she says, "how would
    you know? you didn''t have a wedding." my husband and i eloped six years ago.
    since then, the subject of weddings has been a problem between my mother-in-law
    and me. in my opinion, i did have a wedding. there was a beautiful location, an
    officiant, a dress, and a commitment made between my husband and me. she continues
    to make it painfully obvious that she feels it wasn''t a valid wedding because
    she wasn''t there. her comments, in front of my husband and children, are insulting

    ready and waiting. our idea of a pleasant evening is eating dinner, watching an
    hour or two of tv, and going to bed about 9 p.m. my husband has to drive by these
    neighbors'' house on his way home, so they know when he gets here -- and they
    usually arrive shortly thereafter. i feel very uncomfortable cooking a meal and
    eating with non-eating company in my kitchen, so i always put dinner preparation
    aside and visit with them for an hour or two. it''s not unusual for us to wind

    will you please help librarians across the country clarify something that is generally

    often, people are instructed to go to their library and use a computer to file

    computers with internet access. most do, but not all. further, many libraries
    lack sufficient staff to offer one-on-one support to operate a computer. to someone

    on a mouse and go. the reality is, computers and the internet are not intuitive
    to those who haven''t been exposed to them -- and there are many. while i don''t
    know of a librarian who wouldn''t like to offer unlimited assistance to computer
    users, libraries nationwide are losing staff due to budget cuts. at the same time,
    use of libraries is steadily increasing. it''s frustrating to disappoint patrons
    who expect to receive instruction in computer operation. we prefer they leave
    our building happy. so, abby, please spread the word. computers and internet services

    my 13-year-old niece, "amelia," is a beautiful young girl. she has only two flaws
    -- she lies constantly and she''s boy-crazy. i have to listen to my sister talk

    set many rules and limits for my niece. i think her punishments for breaking rules

    about it. as her punishment this time, my sister and her husband shaved amelia''s
    head. i am shocked and devastated for my niece. i think it was extremely inappropriate.
    when i try to talk to my sister about my concerns, she tells me she had no choice

    a couple of long-term relationships that didn''t turn out well, so my quiet, uncomplicated
    life is refreshing. all i''m looking for now is to make new friends and enjoy
    myself. a few guys have asked me for my phone number -- usually through social
    networking -- and have suggested getting together for a couple of drinks. as nice
    as that would be, the last thing i want to do is lead anyone on or give him the
    wrong impression. when i do decide to start looking, it will be for no one less
    than my prince charming, and i don''t regard any of these men as that. going out
    with girlfriends is hard because they''re mostly married with children. what and
    when is the best way to tell guys that, as much as i enjoy their company, i am
    looking only for friendship at this time? i live in a relatively small town, so
    going out with different men on a regular basis gives people the wrong idea about
    me. -- wants only friendship in michigan'

    my 20-year-old daughter, "roxanne," is attending college in a big city known for
    its crime rate, unemployment and despair. she lives alone in an apartment just
    off campus. she''s a smart girl, careful and cautious, but i still worry about
    her to the point of sleepless nights and a general feeling of "when" something
    will happen -- not if. roxanne''s apartment was broken into last christmas. thankfully,
    she wasn''t there at the time. since then, my worry has intensified -- especially
    if i don''t hear from her for a few hours. we usually text or call each other
    at least once a day. if i don''t hear from her, i panic. my husband calls me a
    professional worrier and says i need to trust that our daughter is safe. i don''t
    think i''ll ever not worry about her, and the truth is i really want her to move
    back home. i realize this would be counterproductive to her achieving success,
    but i don''t know how to let go of the worry. i need advice, abby. is this just
    a "mom thing" or should i seek help? -- half-crazed mom in michigan'

    the time came that i felt i did love and trust him, so i went ahead and had sex

    my adult son, "jake," is in prison for the fourth time for an indiscretion in
    his early 20s. he hasn''t repeated the offense, but he doesn''t comply with the
    rules of his probation and ends up back in prison. i fully supported my son when
    the incident happened because i felt he got a bad break, but i feel he should
    take responsibility for his actions. jake''s repeated offenses for noncompliance
    are part of a rebellious and stubborn attitude and an unwillingness to accept
    the lifelong consequences of his initial offense. to compound the issue, he has
    three daughters. he keeps popping in and out of their lives, which is very disruptive.

    anyway), but i keep trying to maintain some kind of connection between them in
    case he comes around someday. is this foolish thinking on my part? by the way,

    everyone at these activities is either female or with a female as part of a couple.
    there are loads of single middle-aged women out there joining things and having
    fun, but there seem to be almost no single middle-aged men. friends in various
    parts of the country report the same thing. where do the single men go? they rarely
    go out alone or with a male buddy. our running joke is they''re all home watching
    bad cable tv. middle-aged guys must be there somewhere, but where? you''d think

    would you please remind your many readers that the greatest gift we can give to
    america''s fallen is the gift of remembrance? the legacy of those who have died
    for our freedom -- from the revolutionary war to the present -- is something that
    strengthens and unites americans. i would like every child to say, "i know why
    i am free, and i know who died for my freedom." since 1997, major league baseball
    has stopped all games in progress at 3 p.m. on memorial day to observe the national
    moment of remembrance. the umpire steps out from home plate, removes his mask,
    and halts the game so that everyone can pause. the crowd rises as one with hands
    over their hearts. along with mlb, the ironworkers, sheet metal workers and firefighters
    unions, american veterans center, the national cartoonists society and bugles
    across america observe the moment, too. the moment does not replace traditional
    memorial day events. it is not an "event" but an act of conscience. throughout
    our history, and especially during the past decade, servicemen and women in foreign
    lands have been dying almost daily to protect freedom and liberty. we encourage
    all citizens to make every day memorial day in their hearts, but especially on
    memorial day itself. may the love of country always bond americans together. for
    all of the fallen, let us continue to make this nation one great american family
    in spirit. to learn more, please go to www.ngl.org. -- carmella laspada, founder,

    i am a 45-year-old single male with a job i enjoy. last june, a cousin who is
    close to my age married for the second time. he married a girl 20 years younger
    whom he had known less than six months. although i was unable to attend the wedding,
    i sent them a nice card with a generous cash gift. i never received a thank-you
    note for it and although i was offended, i overlooked their rudeness. six weeks
    later, my cousin''s new bride called my place of employment and left an "emergency"
    message to phone her. (she left a second one with a neighbor of mine.) very worried
    and not knowing what to expect, i called her immediately. the "emergency" turned
    out to be a request for a loan of $500. i was angry but tried not to show it.
    after thinking about it, i agreed to the loan, although my cousin''s wife had
    hinted that i should give them a larger amount. we agreed on a repayment plan.
    i had misgivings about helping them, but somehow my aunt -- my cousin''s mother
    -- became involved. she kept insisting i lend them the money. (they were living
    with her at the time.) it has been more than eight months and they have made no
    effort to pay me back. to make matters worse, they avoid me. my aunt acts as though
    it''s all right for them to treat me this way. i am angry, hurt and feel my trust

    i have been part of a book club for almost 20 years. we began as a group of six
    teachers who wanted to share our friendship and love of reading. over the years,
    members have come and gone, but five of the original group remains. we''re now
    a group of nine. our dilemma is that many of the women don''t bother to read the
    monthly selection but still attend the meetings. granted, the meetings are very
    social. everyone brings food to enjoy while we discuss books and anything else
    going on in our lives. however, the core group finds it annoying when some members
    don''t even attempt to read. it happens month after month. we have said on many
    occasions we expect everyone to read. our discussions are livelier and more interesting
    when everyone shares her thoughts, but some don''t make the effort or threaten
    to drop out of the book club. we don''t want anyone to drop out. we are all friends.
    are we expecting too much because as teachers we regard it as a "homework assignment"
    not being completed? what can we do? i''d like your opinion so i can share it
    at the book club. -- pennsville, n.j., reader'

    i have a good friend, "renee," who is canadian and a permanent resident of the
    united states. we don''t always agree on things, but one thing really bugs me
    about her. she''s always saying how "nice" canadians are and how rude americans
    are. on a recent trip we took to canada, she commented about a cashier who was
    nice to us by saying, "that cashier wouldn''t have been so nice if we were in

    as graduation time approaches, i begin to shudder. graduation ceremonies have
    become more like rock concerts than a time to acknowledge student achievements.
    families, friends and graduates behave horribly, making it impossible to watch
    or listen to the proceedings. as both a parent and an educator, may i please offer
    some graduation etiquette advice? 1. do not yell, blow horns or leap into the
    air as your special graduate crosses the stage. it''s rude, immature, inappropriate
    and prevents those around you from hearing the names being called and seeing the
    next graduates. the noisemaking instruments hurt sensitive ears, so leave them
    at home. your special person knows you are there and proud of him or her. 2. honor
    all of the graduates. each one deserves the same audience as the first to cross
    the stage. do not disrupt by leaving after your grad has had his/her moment. stay
    seated until all of them have received recognition. 3. small children do not belong
    at graduations. they get bored, cry, run around, etc., and i don''t blame them.
    hire a sitter and let them stay home. 4. the presenters have worked hard to prepare
    for the ceremony. listen to them and behave like the mature, thoughtful adults
    you expect the graduates to become. 5. have the wild party after the formal ceremony.

    -- addressed only to my husband -- i said that he would attend as he was the only
    one invited. i also asked if i had done something to offend anyone. i was told,
    "no, of course not," and they were "sorry if there was a misunderstanding," because
    the invite was for the whole family. when we see each other, they are polite.
    i feel that pushing the point or not attending would reflect badly on me. what
    do you suggest? i am hurt by years of this treatment, and stu is just as offended.

    my 17-year-old daughter, "corey," is in a two-year relationship with "greg," who''s
    19 and in the naval academy at annapolis. they have exchanged promise rings and
    agreed to make this long-distance relationship work. she went to visit him for
    thanksgiving and he came home for christmas. he also returned for spring break.
    he takes advantage of every opportunity to see corey. we live in california and
    corey is a junior in high school. prom is almost here, and greg has told her he
    doesn''t want her to miss out on anything. i feel she should not go with anyone
    else -- that it''s a sacrifice you make when you have a boyfriend. well, she accepted
    an invitation from a guy "friend" and greg said he was fine with it. i sent greg
    a text message, and he repeated that sentiment. i believe greg was thinking she
    wouldn''t actually go to the prom and he was just trying to be nice, hoping she''d
    make the better decision. i am stressed that this may ruin her relationship and
    she''ll be devastated. what''s the etiquette? is it ok for her to go to the prom

    may i comment on the letter from "working the window in georgia" (jan. 22), the
    drive-through worker who said people should have their orders ready when they
    pull up to the speaker? many drive-through restaurants place their speakers in
    front of the first menu you see. unless you frequent the restaurant, it''s impossible
    to know what you want until you reach the menu. also, if "corporate" is timing
    its employees, then maybe they should dispense with having the employees greet
    customers with a long list of item suggestions before taking the order. those
    of us at the other end of the speaker often cannot understand a word being said,

    how are we supposed to have any idea of what to order when we don''t see the menu
    until we pull up to the window? this is especially true when i try a new restaurant.
    if restaurants post anything before that, it is usually just a list of their most
    expensive combo meals. sometimes the prices aren''t even listed at the preview
    menu window. here are some suggestions for people working the windows: 1. i may
    not know your menu. so please give me a chance to look it over. if you have a
    drive-through, i have a right to use it. if you don''t want new customers to know
    what you offer, then i''ll be happy to take my business elsewhere. 2. i know you
    are reading from a script, but if i don''t want a combo meal, please do not ask
    me repeatedly if i want one. 3. give me a chance to check my order when you hand
    it to me. i am really tired of getting to my destination only to find out my order
    is wrong. 4. do not argue with me if i want to verify that my drink is a diet
    drink. i am diabetic and a non-diet soda could make me very sick. 5. please understand
    that even if i don''t have the radio on and there is no background noise, i may
    still have trouble understanding you. perhaps the speakers are bad or i am slightly
    hearing-impaired. 6. please give me straw if i order a drink. i have worked fast
    food before and i know from experience it is not an easy job. yes, there are rude
    customers, but there are also rude employees. i know that from experience, too.

    my mother has never liked her sister-in-law. mom thinks "auntie beth" is "completely
    out to get her," even though no one has seen any evidence to support my mother''s
    claims. for the past several months, mom has been complaining nonstop about how
    "awful" beth is. she says things at the most random times to people she barely
    knows. if we don''t show sympathy toward mom, she then becomes enraged. it has
    caused many problems between our family and auntie beth''s. we can''t have holidays
    together because my aunt is not allowed in our house. no one wants to be involved
    in the drama or to participate in the terrible gossip. how can i help my mother

    i recently attended a baby shower for a dear high school friend and his wife.

    miscarriages and held this shower at five months, knowing the baby is not yet

    "modern dad in roswell, ga." (feb. 26) was put off that invitations to his young
    daughters are sent to his ex-wife''s home rather than to both his and the ex-wife''s.
    he assumes the sender is "sexist" and suggests the solution for children with
    two households is to be sent two invitations. as a parent who invites children
    to my home or to a party, i don''t feel i should be responsible for their parents''
    communication difficulty. often i am not even aware that a child has two households.
    the invitation simply goes home with the child to wherever he or she is that day.
    personally, i think "modern dad" is overly sensitive. he needs to realize that
    no one is deliberately snubbing him or making assumptions about parental roles.
    they are just inviting his kids to things, for which he should be grateful. did
    he share his address with the inviter? does he make his preference clear to parents
    when meeting them? i believe it''s presumptuous to expect someone to send two
    invitations to the same child. and i agree with you, abby, that "dad" needs to
    improve communication with his ex-wife so he no longer feels he is being prevented
    from being an "active parent." -- regular mom in tennessee'

    from her husband, lives alone and shares custody of their three children. she
    started dating almost immediately after her separation, going out with almost
    anyone who showed her a little attention. she''s now involved with a man who told
    her he''s bisexual and has never taken her out on a date. (still, he never hesitates
    to call and ask her to clean his bathroom or cook him a meal.) she''s always crying
    on my shoulder because she ends up with losers, yet the picture she has on her
    profile on all the dating sites shows her in a skimpy bikini. one evening melody
    asked me why she can''t attract a "decent man." i told her that she needs to love
    herself before she can be loved. i also mentioned that if she wants to stop attracting
    sleazy men, she should consider changing her profile picture. she became angry

    my ex-husband likes to call to ask me for advice. our most recent conversation
    was in regard to his girlfriend and her sexual past, which he knew about before
    they started dating. he now disapproves of her history and he began calling her
    unpleasant names. he tells me he deserves better but intends to stay with her
    until he gets bored. hearing this sort of talk gives me a stomachache and heartburn.
    i feel terrible for the woman. i want to be a friend to my ex, but i''m not sure
    i can handle the stress it causes. he has had a hard life, and i didn''t make
    it any easier by divorcing him. is the only solution not to take his calls, like
    my friends tell me? i''m not sure i can do that without major guilt. -- wisconsin

    i attend a church with about 350 worshippers. the church provides a supervised
    nursery for infants to 2 years of age. most parents with babies use it. however,
    one couple has a 2-year-old child and a 2-month-old baby. these parents do not
    take advantage of the nursery, but keep the kids in the sanctuary. last sunday
    the baby, who was in the father''s arms, cried during most of the service. the
    parents may be able to tune it out, but many of us were very distracted by the
    wailing. the father is a schoolteacher. i couldn''t help but wonder how this teacher
    would handle a student who caused such a disruption in his classroom. i don''t
    think he would tolerate an hour of loud crying from anyone. why don''t these people
    understand their behavior prevents others from worshipping as they would like?

    my youngest daughter, "lizzy," the sweetest and most conscientious of my children,
    has been cut off yet again by her mother, "ruth." ruth pressured lizzy to graduate
    from high school a year early because she couldn''t date with a child still at
    home. (her words.) after graduation, lizzy was shipped off to another state for
    college, then abandoned to find her own funding for continued education. lizzy
    feels unwanted by her mother and desperately wants to know why. the truth is,
    ruth didn''t want that pregnancy in the first place and has held it against lizzy.
    the deeper truth is i wanted another child and deliberately got ruth pregnant.
    i never told anyone, even after ruth divorced me several years later. as far as
    i know, she has always accepted it as accidental. what i did was wrong, yet i
    can''t imagine a world without my daughter in it. lizzy is the only one of my
    children who has become close to me since the divorce. the others all believe
    their mother''s lies about me -- that i cheated on her, which is the opposite
    of what really happened. should i share the truth about her birth with my daughter?
    i''m not sure because i have always believed it is a major mistake to admit to
    a child of any age that their pregnancy was a surprise, let alone that it was
    unwanted. two of my siblings weren''t planned, and one of them has become a bitter
    and distant adult. i want to help my daughter understand and accept her mother''s

    my friend "veronica" is obsessed with food -- not just eating it, but also talking

    eating, especially if it''s something i have made. i can''t open a container of
    yogurt without her asking what flavor it is. on a daily basis, veronica announces
    what she''s making for dinner that night, what she made the night before and what
    kind of desserts she has planned. i used to share my food with her, but i stopped
    when she wanted bites i didn''t offer. i had to stop buying from the vending machine
    at work, too, because veronica began to expect to share. when i refused, she''d
    make "joking" snide remarks. she never has any money to return the favors. veronica
    will tap her cup on the table and watch me out of the corner of her eye. or, she''ll
    stare at what i''m eating. if anyone at the table has extra food or dessert, veronica
    will be the first to take it. she could tell you what all five women at that table
    had for lunch that day, but she''s particularly interested in mine. veronica is

    i''m confused about the protocol in thanking or repaying someone after staying
    several nights at their home. my feeling is, if you''re staying with people, the
    nicest way to thank them for their hospitality is to pay for most, if not all,
    the lunches and dinners you share with them when you dine out. that way, you lessen
    the monetary burden of your visit, and it gives you a chance to say "thank you"
    for the use of their home. some visitors seem to think that when they come to
    your home, you should not only put them up, but also pay for all their activities
    while you show them your town. what is correct? or is it a matter of preference?

    my little sister is almost 12. she has been having a lot of behavior problems.
    i thought it was the stupid videos she watches that made her act like that, but
    she''s getting worse. one night, her mood was terrible and i noticed she was texting.
    so while she slept i took her cellphone and started reading the messages. her
    texts were about her being a skank, drunk, sexually active, depressed, cutting
    herself and moving away soon. no one in the family knows or would ever allow this.
    i feel the right thing to do is to tell our parents, but i don''t want to make
    the situation worse. her behavior and attitude stress us out, and her "friends"
    are the wrong crowd for her. i know it was bad for me to invade her privacy, but

    harry to gay bars where he gets "hit on" often. i can tell he likes the attention.
    i should also mention that dan seems to be considerably less interested in sex
    lately. i hate to think of my husband alone and lonely while i''m away, but his
    going to gay bars every night is beginning to worry me. if i say anything to him

    "darrel" and i have been married 28 years. i thought we had an easy, comfortable

    two for business and two for special sporting events. i''m beginning to get little
    nagging signals that he may not have been on these trips alone. he shuts his phone
    off for hours at a time and changed the password on his computer after i had to
    get on it for a security update. the last time he went, he told me he had won
    two tickets in las vegas to a show, so i asked him to bring the extra one home
    so i could see it. when he returned, he didn''t have it. he said he had misplaced
    it. there are other things, too, and i don''t know what to think. i don''t want

    go on anymore and his heart isn''t in it. the fact that i''m married bothers him.

    my boyfriend, "justin," and i are in our early 20s. we were high school sweethearts
    and we have a little girl together. everything was going well until justin went
    to a car lot to look for a car for his mother. he came home that day with a new
    one. my problem is he used the money he told me he was saving for my engagement
    ring as the down payment. i am very hurt. i tried to seem happy and excited for
    him, but he knew i was upset and says i''m being "ridiculous." at this rate, with
    the new car and the insurance for it almost doubled, i don''t see how he''ll have
    anything put away for a ring in the near future. i have told justin i don''t care
    about the size or the price of the ring, it''s the thought behind it that counts.
    justin still says he wants to get me an expensive one. i''m beginning to think
    he''s making excuses so he won''t have to propose to me anytime soon. what do
    you think? -- engaged-in-waiting in ohio'

    do you think every american child should get a four-year college degree? i keep
    meeting students who have a real talent and passion for other jobs -- military,
    cosmetology or skilled trades, such as internet technology and carpentry -- but
    whose parents are furious at the suggestion they might not graduate from a four-year
    college. it''s a little-known fact that there is actually a shortage of skilled
    tradespeople these days. it jobs pay well and are constantly in demand. as my
    grandmother used to say, "everyone needs a plumber when the toilet''s clogged."
    it distresses me to see so many parents disregard their kids'' instincts about
    their skills and desired careers in favor of the "more schooling is always better"
    philosophy. graduating from college has been part of what we envision as the "american
    dream," but not every kid is going to be fulfilled after getting one of those
    degrees when the jobs that go with it don''t materialize. if a child wants to
    go into the military or become a skilled tradesperson, parents should at least
    consider what they''re suggesting. because someone chooses a career path that
    isn''t what a parent hoped for doesn''t mean he or she can''t be successful. --

    for 20 years, my secret (to some, but not to others) involvement with a married
    man has kept me on an emotional roller coaster. we were both married at the time
    it began, and it was always understood that we would not leave our partners. however,
    since then my marriage has broken down. conventional wisdom -- expressed by friends,
    family and your column repeatedly -- has it that i should end this hopeless affair,
    get out and meet other men. i have made numerous attempts, but have accepted that
    he''s the only man i feel comfortable being intimate with. i don''t want him to
    leave his marriage, from which he draws much respectability and desperately needed
    security. however, his obvious delight in our afternoon trysts does suggest that
    his so-called picture-perfect marriage doesn''t meet his emotional and sexual
    needs. and that''s what irks me! this couple presents a happy profile in our community.
    the urge to burst his hypocritical bubble is growing within me with every passing
    year. would it be morally reprehensible for me to let his wife know that she has
    been made a fool of for the last 20 years? -- seething in canada'

    i am an amateur playwright. our local theater sponsors an annual playwriting contest.
    the prize isn''t monetary, but something far more important to an author -- a

    i will graduate from college in june and be a social worker. i am psychic, although
    i dislike that word because it conjures up visions of crystal balls, quacks and
    scams. for legitimate psychic individuals, it can be overwhelming to live this
    way. i first noticed my ability when i was young, but i repressed it because my
    folks thought i was imagining things. it began to resurge in college. this school
    is haunted, so i have become used to daily interactions with ghosts -- often in
    the dead of night. i also notice that during client counseling sessions images
    will pop into my head. i once gave a classmate the "willies" by perfectly describing
    the garden in her backyard having never laid eyes on it. my adviser says i must
    never tell my clients the things i "see" in them because it will frighten them.
    it''s hard to separate my own thoughts and emotions from those of spirits around
    me. i''m concerned about my psychic ability in relation to my clients. if i pick
    up on abuse in the mind of a child, for example, am i obligated to report it?
    being psychic is as natural to me as my having blue eyes. it will never go away.
    i must now find the means to manage it. i don''t want a career as a medium. i''m
    dedicated to the profession i have chosen. can you offer me advice? -- gifted

    have a job, she sits around in her pajamas all day playing on the computer or

    i frequently talk on my cellphone in public, and i''m often irked by the comments
    i get from people to put my phone away. personally, i don''t see a difference
    between a cellphone conversation and an in-person conversation, provided i keep
    the noise level down. it''s not like i''m talking about excessively personal subjects
    or anything. i spend an hour on the train going to and coming from work, and i
    like to use that time to catch up with my friends. am i wrong for constantly talking

    i have been married 18 years. in that time my husband has been unfaithful twice.
    last week i was going through his cellphone and noticed from his emails that he
    had registered on a dating service and was exchanging photos with four women.
    i threw him out of the house. what really upsets me is my 17-year-old son knew
    about the affairs and thinks it''s perfectly normal for his dad to have female
    "friends" while we were still living together. i don''t like what my soon-to-be-ex
    did to me, and i don''t want my son thinking it''s ok to start looking while you''re
    still married. my son finds ways to excuse his father''s behavior. how can i make
    him understand that looking for other partners while you''re married is being
    unfaithful? -- texas wife who''s had it'

    my girlfriend and i have been dating for four years. in the beginning, we''d split
    our visits between her house and mine because we live 100 miles apart. two years
    ago she stopped wanting me to come to her house. she''d say it was dirty or that
    she didn''t want anyone there. when we plan to have me go there, the day arrives
    and she says she wants to break up with me because i insist on visiting her. over
    the past year and a half, i have been to her place only three times. she hemmed
    and hawed but finally allowed it. she claims there''s no reason she''s acting
    this way, that i''m crazy and people are putting ideas in my head. i tell her

    for years, i suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes. i never had a clue
    that they are the two leading causes of kidney failure. after reading in your
    column about national kidney month, i decided to take your suggestion and go to
    the national kidney foundation website at kidney.org. when i attended their free
    screening through the kidney early evaluation program (keep), i found out that
    high blood pressure can damage the kidney''s filtering units, that diabetes is
    the no. 1 risk factor for kidney disease and how important it is to keep them
    both under control. that screening was a wake-up call for me. i now take insulin
    for my diabetes and medication for my blood pressure. i have cut out salt and
    starch, added lots of vegetables to my diet, and 30 minutes on the stationary
    bike to my daily routine. my efforts have paid off. last year when i was screened
    again at the keep, i learned that my kidney function has increased. tens of millions
    of americans are at risk for kidney disease. won''t you please remind your readers
    again how important it is to be screened? for me it was a lifesaver. -- jerrydean

    someone gave a very inappropriate eulogy for someone my family cares about dearly.
    is it worth it to say something to him? "alton" lost his mother, a really good
    person who was loved by many, and he attacked her during his eulogy. alton shared
    quite a few details about his mother''s life that no one needed to know. but the
    bottom line is, she was a good person who made some mistakes toward the end of
    her life. alton is arrogant and mean and has a long history of verbally attacking
    family members. people are still talking about the eulogy. there were individuals
    at the service who called him names, and a few walked out in tears. word spread
    to people in other states within minutes after the service ended. is it worth
    pointing out to an arrogant jerk that his eulogy was appalling and has caused
    a lot of anger? should one of us step forward and say something to him, or just

    as a divorced dad, i''m hoping you''ll address a problem i have encountered in

    i have worked in a medical clinic for 35 years and hear a lot of complaints about
    the wait for doctor appointments. may i explain some of the reasons for it? sometimes
    the doctor arrives late, but other factors can cause delays: 1. if you need to
    be seen, call first to get an appointment time. most offices leave open spots
    to accommodate urgent-care matters. if you just walk in, we must work you in with
    patients who already have appointments, which pushes the doctor behind. 2. do
    not come an hour early and announce in front of the entire waiting room that you
    must be somewhere and expect to get worked in before your scheduled time. reschedule
    instead. 3. always bring your insurance cards with you. do not tell us to call
    another doctor''s office to get the information. 4. don''t walk in with forms
    you need filled out and signed by the doctor and expect someone to take care of
    it immediately. it requires your chart to be pulled, a nurse to fill out the information
    and the doctor to look over the form and sign. instead, leave the form. we''ll
    mail it or call you to pick it up. 5. don''t expect to call the office and speak
    with the doctor in the middle of a clinic day. a nurse can usually handle the
    question. if not, she''ll have the doctor call you back after seeing the scheduled
    patients. -- gentle reminder in sioux falls, s.d.'

    my husband and i have become fond of a delightful elderly couple, "frank" and

    four children, two of whom live nearby. two years ago, frank was diagnosed with
    dementia. they are adamant about staying in the house they''ve owned since they
    were newlyweds. this means more of the burden of caring for the house and finances
    now falls to annie, who has health problems of her own. we help out whenever we
    can, because i know money is tight for them. when their lawnmower broke, we bought
    them a new one, and with the help of another neighbor, we take care of general
    yardwork and house issues. i am growing increasingly concerned about the state
    of their finances, and bewildered that their children never seem to help. they
    interact with their parents at birthdays and on holidays. i don''t know the children
    well, but is there a way to help them understand that their parents may not be
    volunteering all their troubles? frank and annie are proud of what they''ve accomplished,
    but now they need a little extra support. they never ask for help, but gratefully

    with the charade for a week -- until his guilt got the better of him, and he admitted
    he had made it all up. he claims he doesn''t want to divorce me after all. he
    said he made up the stories to get his daughters'' attention. roman and i are
    now going through counseling, and i am assuming responsibility for my part in
    this mess. he harbors strong resentment toward me and resorted to passive-aggressive
    revenge. we''re both doing our best to establish forthright, honest and open lines
    of communication. the problem is his daughters still believe the lies. they hate
    me and won''t speak to their father unless he divorces me. i''m not sure what
    to do. roman has lost his family and he may lose me, too. the damage is so widespread

    my husband and i belong to a supper club comprised of four couples. we have enjoyed
    our monthly gatherings for years and have developed a strong bond with each couple.
    as a rule, each one takes turns hosting the event in their home. the recent behavior
    of one hostess has us baffled. for starters, "lynn" sometimes seats herself and
    her husband at a separate table, even though there''s room at the main table.
    she also involves herself with activities i consider rude -- taking calls on her
    cell, perusing facebook, doing paperwork. it''s beginning to feel as though we
    are an obligation rather than wanted guests. members of our group have been hesitant
    to discuss this with her because we don''t want to create tension in the group

    why not use the american sign language symbol for "sorry"? make a fist with your

    i married "andy" a year ago. he has three children from a prior marriage. he had
    a vasectomy eight years ago, but promised he''d have it reversed so we could have
    a child together. he didn''t get around to it, but i''m pregnant anyway. at first
    we felt it was our miracle baby. however, 15 weeks later, andy is now "sure" the
    baby isn''t his. things have gotten so bad that i moved out of our house. abby,
    i have never been unfaithful. a paternity test will prove he''s the father, but
    that can''t be done until after our baby is born. i have scheduled an appointment
    with a therapist, but i''m not sure i want to reconcile with him. have other readers
    been in this situation? what was the outcome? -- pregnant and alone on the east

    my stepson, "david," lives with my husband and me and our 9-year-old son. he is
    20 and has been with us since he was a child because his mother couldn''t control
    him. he had major problems in school -- detentions, failing grades, etc. -- and
    has been nothing but trouble. david is disrespectful, a chronic liar and a thief.
    he has even threatened to kill us. david''s mother bought him a car and his grandmother
    gives him money to buy anything he wants -- including guns. he won''t get a driver''s
    license, refuses to get a job, won''t help around the house and lies to people,
    saying we don''t feed him. he has even said his dad beats him every day. i want
    my husband to give david a choice: get his license, get a job and help around
    the house, or get out, but my husband refuses. his excuse is, where will he go?
    my husband works out of town occasionally, and when he''s gone i have our 9-year-old
    sleep with me and i lock the door because i''m afraid of david. what can we do?

    at this time of year i have seen letters in your column from couples describing
    how they met. i hope you will print ours. during a study break one evening in
    april 1937, i walked to bruckner boulevard park in the bronx to sit on a bench
    and watch the cars drive by. a cyclist whizzed through the center walkway, then
    stopped and slowly backed up to where i was sitting. "hello," he said. i responded.
    "who are you?" he asked. "i''m queen elizabeth the first," i told him without
    batting an eye. "well," he replied, "i''m sir walter raleigh -- unfortunately,
    i don''t have a coat to place at your feet." then he sat down beside me. we talked,
    we laughed, and he walked me home. four years later, ben and i eloped. that was
    april 3, 1941. this year we will celebrate our 71st anniversary and have, in our
    lifetime together, accumulated three beautiful daughters, nine grandchildren,
    20 great-grandchildren, three great-great-grandchildren and another on the way.
    we have shared our tears, our joys, our failures and our successes. we have worked
    long hours, taken vacations, participated in sports and traveled. we have enjoyed
    every moment. now in our 90s, we are financially secure, have a caring family
    and many beautiful memories. ben, however, has not as yet placed his coat at my

    last weekend i went to a birthday slumber party at a friend''s house. we played
    poker as we often do, then one girl suggested we play strip poker. she was kind
    of pushy about it. i wasn''t comfortable with the idea and chose not to participate.
    i was the only one. everybody laughed at me. they called me a prude and told me
    "all girls look the same." i don''t think i''m a prude. i''m not shy about undressing
    in front of my sister and friends. i''m just not comfortable about something like
    this and saw no point to it. i mean, if "we''re all the same," then what''s the

    those who ended up taking it all off laughed about it. is there something wrong
    with me? now they''re talking about doing it at future slumber parties, so i''m

    i have been divorced for two years and am friendly with a man, "byron," whose
    friendship i value. a few weeks ago we decided to explore a dating relationship.
    unfortunately, the past couple of weeks have been busy for me. we haven''t been
    able to spend as much time together as either of us would like. last night byron
    texted me, saying he "knew where this was going" and thought we should "talk about
    it." he subsequently said he thinks i wasn''t being honest about wanting to spend
    time together. when i reassured him, he explained that he has abandonment issues.
    now i feel i must be careful not to do anything that might cause him to panic.
    should i back off now and try to salvage the friendship, or should i give the
    romance a chance? his paranoid actions so early into this stage of our relationship
    have made me uncomfortable. it''s as if he''s asking for a guarantee already.

    drivers. "jon" is a good driver. he likes to drive in the left (passing) lane
    on the highway or tollway, usually about five miles above the posted speed limit.
    this is considered too slow for many drivers, who become impatient and aggressive
    having to be behind us in the fast lane. they flash their headlights and tailgate
    us, trying to get him to move over into the right lane so they can pass, but jon
    refuses to yield. if they start to pass us on the right, he will speed up and
    race them so they can''t get ahead of him. he says he''s "teaching them a lesson."
    i have told my husband repeatedly that these games are dangerous and they scare
    me. not only could we get into an accident, but we could get into an ugly confrontation
    or worse. i am terrified in these situations and he knows it, but he continues.

    to, so jon drives at night or when we''re going long distances. with the price

    i''m 30 years old and have a close relationship with my mother, but something
    is bothering me. when i was a little girl, my grandmother gave me a u.s. savings
    bond for my birthday. it has matured to its full value. my mother refuses to give
    it to me. she said that my grandmother intended it as a wedding gift. the last
    time i brought it up, she got teary and emotional. when my grandmother died 18
    years ago, it was tremendously painful for my mother. i think the reason mom won''t
    give me the money is it makes her feel like her mom is still around. by letting
    go of the bond, she would be letting go of one more piece of my grandmother. i
    also think it makes her sad to picture her mom not being there at my wedding.
    despite all this, i can''t help but feel she''s using this to have some control
    over me. i''m studying for my master''s degree in special education, and some
    extra money would be helpful at the moment. i don''t plan on marrying anyone anytime
    soon. i feel sad and angry. does my mother have the right to withhold the bond
    and decide how and when i can use the money? should i drop the issue and let her
    choose when to give it to me? please help, i need your advice. -- 30-year-old

    how does one let a gum chewer know, tactfully, that the smell is revolting? besides
    the irritation and rudeness of chewing/popping with one''s mouth open, certain
    smells often affect me physically. from a young age, i have suffered from migraine
    headaches, which can bring on temporary loss of vision and vomiting. the scent
    of certain mints -- like spearmint -- triggers migraines. my doctor has warned
    me to avoid these triggers. however, in a confined area like an airplane, or sandwiched
    between two chewers at a concert, it''s impossible. i become violently ill from
    the smell. i have tried politely explaining my situation, but the chewer is often
    indifferent, indignant or unsympathetic. abby, i''m at a loss. my husband and
    i often leave concerts we were looking forward to because of this problem. what
    can one do or say in a situation when sitting for hours in an assigned seat next

    years, her husband, "kirk," has cheated on her multiple times and was once arrested
    by an undercover cop when he tried to meet a 14-year-old for a sexual liaison.
    despite it all, claire has chosen to stay with him. i have made peace with the

    affected my life in any practical way -- until now. i am being married next year,

    failure to address a patient/resident by his or her proper name is a violation
    of regulations and could be cited during surveys. if the patient preferred a nickname,
    the care plan conference team (staff department heads, family and patient) needed
    to make a notation in the care plan to allow the nickname to be used. most of
    this is covered by the patient''s bill of rights and falls under the "right to
    be treated with respect and dignity." using terms like "sweetie" or "granny" is
    a symptom of the staff''s failure to respect the patient''s individuality. they
    are objectifying and dehumanizing the person and becoming too complacent (or lazy)
    to learn his or her name. besides, if an aide approached me and said, "granny

    i get good grades, have many great friends, a weekend job and an amazing boyfriend.

    besides the one i have now. i had two "flings" where i got involved with guys
    without an official or physical relationship. i know most teenagers would kill

    my mother gives gifts -- sometimes very generous ones -- but always with strings
    attached. she also keeps a record of which recipients have responded with appropriate
    gratitude (cards, phone calls) and those who have not. those individuals on the
    "not" list are ridiculed behind their backs and slighted in other ways. my mother
    considers herself a "good christian," but i believe her actions are selfish, and

    food. if you have a large order or a special request, please come inside to order
    if possible. the people in the car behind you are waiting for their food, too.
    speak clearly (but don''t yell!) into the speaker. also, although it may seem
    cute to you, i can barely understand your 4-year-old when she asks me for her
    kiddie meal. if you can''t hear yourself over your car radio, i can''t either.
    but if you''re talking on your cellphone or to someone in your vehicle, i can
    hear you -- and i''ve heard some wild stuff. if it''s raining, please turn off
    your windshield wipers before you reach my window. otherwise, i get splashed.

    to buy a small bottle of laundry detergent. well, my bank card was declined. abby,
    i was mortified. near tears, i told the cashier to go ahead and cancel my purchase.

    are you supposed to ignore an acquaintance when you notice she''s in a doctor''s
    waiting room with you? (especially if it''s a specialist''s office that makes
    a particular condition obvious to an otherwise non-privy person?) this has happened
    to me twice recently. one time, i avoided the acquaintance; the other, i broke
    the silence and said, "is that you, so-and-so?" both times it was awkward. i can
    understand why someone wouldn''t want to be seen at certain doctors'' offices.

    i have very nice neighbors who believe in leaving the wild and natural growth

    my boyfriend, "cole," and i have been together since college -- several years
    now. we have a loving relationship, but the problem is distance. my job sometimes
    requires me to take short-term (two- to five-month) contracts in other cities
    and overseas. even though it is difficult to be apart, i handle long-distance
    relationships relatively well while cole does not. this began in college when
    i studied abroad for a semester. cole tries to be supportive and wants me to be
    successful, but he takes it personally when i have to leave. for me, it''s just
    about a job, but cole doesn''t see it that way. i would support cole wherever
    and in whatever he needed. although it would be ideal to be together all the time,

    i have been accepted to a school that''s the alma mater of several of my relatives.
    my mother, several aunts and other family members all belonged to one sorority
    at this college. they are urging me to pledge there and uphold the family tradition.
    they say they had some of the best times of their lives as members of that sorority
    chapter. the members do well academically, as the sorority insists on it. they
    made lifelong friends, and their sorority contacts have been extremely helpful
    personally and professionally. although this chapter is very exclusive and accepts
    only the best-of-the-best, i will have no problems getting in, not only because
    of my academic record but also because i''m a "legacy." so what''s the problem?
    this sorority chapter still uses the paddle. technically they don''t haze -- that
    is, have any initiation stunts -- but they do use the paddle for disciplinary
    purposes. when i mention my concerns about the paddling to my mother and aunts,
    they say i should suck it up, as the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.
    one of my aunts said she thinks the rules and discipline would be beneficial for
    me because she considers me kind of a "wild child." abby, i don''t know if you

    growing up, we were very poor, and my parents made it clear that sacrifices had
    been made for my "big day," which always ended up with me guilt-ridden and in
    tears. as an adult, i celebrate my birthday with my husband and son. we keep it
    low-key and i''m surrounded by the unconditional love i craved as a child. i have
    tried bowing out and asked that gifts be made to charity instead, but i am told,
    "oh, come on! we all have to go through this." i went so far as to confide to
    the party planners why i''m so uncomfortable. to my horror, a few of them began

    dating back to before i was born. i am also sad that dad won''t visit his mother

    to deserve being forced to die alone, and it hurts knowing my mother would be

    i had some time to think over the summer, and came to the realization that a baby
    my girlfriend had almost 30 years ago may be my daughter. "sally" and i had a
    very intense, but short-lived relationship that blew up. about a year later we
    met again for lunch at the behest of a mutual friend. i don''t remember the details,
    but i do remember searching for an accurate way to compliment her. because she
    had put on weight, the best i could come up with was "you look good." she didn''t
    hit me, but the conversation went downhill from there. sally mentioned as we were
    parting that she had given birth to a daughter. i haven''t heard from her since.
    i don''t want to create problems for anybody, but i''m curious. i''m happily married
    and plan to stay that way. at the same time, i''d welcome having a daughter. i
    have thought about sending cheek swabs and a check-off dna test to the child along
    with a note suggesting she send our samples in for testing. but that could destroy
    whatever story she may have grown up with. i''m at a loss here. i could use some
    advice from an outside authority. what do you think i should do? -- blockhead

    my brother mocks everything i do, the friends i spend time with and my politics.

    to answer, "nothing." so now he tells me how "boring" i am, in addition to his

    i have some advice for "lacking why," the girl in your oct. 18 column who is wondering
    why the amount of allowance money grandpa gives her and her sisters varies from
    one girl to the other: stop comparing the amounts and try focusing on how attentive
    each of you is to your grandfather. do you all visit him with the same frequency?
    do you all write thank-you notes for his generosity? do you all phone him the
    same number of times each week? do you all remember his birthday with a nice card
    or small gift? do you take turns baking him a birthday cake? i suspect, as with
    my grandchildren, there are wide disparities in the way these sisters treat grandpa.
    why would a person who ignores him expect the same generosity as one who showers
    him with love and affection? i have two grown grandkids who treat me differently

    i''m 50 and my boyfriend, "ray," is 55. we have been together for 11 years. he''s

    until a year ago, when we sold them and bought a house together. we each pay half
    the bills including the mortgage. we love each other, get along great, have similar
    values and can''t imagine not being together. my problem is i want to get married.
    ray does, too, but his 20-year-old daughter isn''t ready for it yet. she and i
    get along fine, but she gets very stressed and cries when the topic is mentioned.

    to get her way. but ray insists she has anxiety issues, and he''s afraid she will
    hurt herself if we get married. i say we should just do it and hope that, eventually,
    she accepts it. counseling is out of the question for her. she won''t go. ray
    and i did go for advice about this. the counselor agreed that his daughter needs
