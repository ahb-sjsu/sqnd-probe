    i am 20, and my life seems to be going nowhere. i graduated from high school two
    years ago and have put off going to college. i am obese and have no willpower
    to exercise to get healthy. i''m constantly thinking about the past. in high school
    i had few friends, none of whom keep in touch with me. i recently bumped into
    a former guy friend at a store. we were close during my junior year, but he ignored
    me in my senior year. at the store, he didn''t speak to me, which was hurtful.
    it reminded me of the pain i felt back in school. i always felt so alone. my dream

    i am an ordained minister and a senior citizen. at the present time i do not have
    a position with a church. i rely on part-time work officiating at funerals and
    weddings and earn a very modest living. i work hard to make each funeral service
    meaningful. it often involves meeting with family members to hear stories about
    their loved one, and sometimes i must drive many miles to and from the church
    where the funeral is held. i always receive compliments from the families afterward,
    telling me how touched they were. then they fail to pay me a single red cent!
    most of these people know i am essentially unemployed, yet they offer me nothing
    for all my work. abby, nobody goes into the ministry for the money, but clergy
    have to eat, fill their gas tanks and pay their bills just like everyone else.
    what can i do to make sure i am compensated? please don''t tell me to set a specific
    fee, because i''d be glad to accept any offering they can afford. besides, it
    seems tacky for a member of the clergy to ask for a fee upfront. it would be different
    if i was still on staff at a church and receiving a salary, but such is not the
    case. -- thorny issue in florida'

    i was widowed a year ago and joined a support group for widows and widowers. (i
    am 50 years young.) through this group i met a gentleman, "robert," who lost his
    wife two years ago. we became friends and have since fallen in love. i would like
    to think we have a future together. recently, i have been feeling guilty about
    our relationship, as though i am "cheating" on my late husband, and i''m wondering
    if this is normal. should i keep these feelings to myself or discuss them with
    robert? should i go to counseling? perhaps the one-year anniversary of my husband''s
    death has brought out these feelings. i''m remembering our last days together
    and feeling guilty about having started a new relationship. i don''t want to hurt
    robert or push him away by bringing this up if this is a normal phase most widows
    go through. -- starting over in virginia beach, va.'

    although i don''t think my last name is a particularly difficult one, people often
    struggle with it when they go to write it after i say it. i understand this and
    it does not bother me. as a matter of habit, i routinely spell my name immediately
    after i say it, to assist the person who is writing it down. a security guard

    my husband is extremely narcissistic and passive-aggressive. during our entire

    economically and sexually abusive. i have remained in the marriage this long because
    i thought keeping the family intact was the right thing to do for my children.

    that living in the atmosphere of a loveless, abusive marriage can be as detrimental
    for kids as a breakup would be. i will soon be filing for divorce. my dilemma:
    because ted is very good at projecting a "good guy" image, i''m sure that people
    won''t believe he is abusive. should i be open about the reason for the divorce
    and be accused of lying? we live in ted''s hometown, a small, rural community.

    "susan" and i have been married for many years. after our sons left for college,
    my wife began experiencing "empty-nest syndrome," so i surprised her with two
    cats. i''m not wild about cats, but i knew she''d be pleased. big mistake! susan
    is constantly doting on her "babies" (as she calls them). her time is spent brushing
    them, talking to them, playing with them and photographing them. when we do have
    a little feline-free time, it''s spent talking about them. i have grown more and
    more annoyed with these spoiled cats who have 100 percent of her attention. i
    have tried expressing my feelings, but she reminds me that i was the one who "adopted"
    them in the first place. any suggestions? -- hubby in purr-gatory'

    my parents live nearby and are extremely helpful with my young children. my mom
    feels the need to be the "fun" grandma, and her way of accomplishing it is to
    always have sweet treats available for the kids in her home. in my home, she allows
    them to skip vegetables at dinner and loads them up with dessert. because she
    is helping me out i ignore this, but every once in a while i ask her in front
    of the kids to refrain from giving them sweets. my children recently told me that
    the second i walk out the door she goes and gets the sweets and hands them out.
    they all told me they do not have to say a word -- she just does it. i feel this

    i am 18, disabled, and work with a service dog. i would like to offer people a
    few tips on interacting with service dog owners. perhaps it will lessen some of
    the daily frustrations all handlers deal with: 1. not all service dogs are big
    dogs. i know several chihuahuas who save their owners'' lives every day with their
    medical alert tasks. 2. not all disabilities are visible. please don''t ask, "what''s
    wrong with you?" or, "what''s your problem?" 3. there are many kinds of service
    dogs, not just guide dogs. medical alert dogs help people with everything from
    epilepsy to diabetes to panic attacks. there are also autism service dogs, mobility
    dogs and hearing dogs. 4. please do not pet my dog without asking me first. my
    dog wears a patch that says, "do not pet." it''s there for a reason. abby, i can''t
    count the number of people who read her patch out loud, then reach out to pet
    her anyway. please do not take it personally if we say no. 5. if a dog''s handler
    seems ill, it''s ok -- even preferable -- to ask if we are all right. i once had
    an episode and no less than two dozen people walked right past me while i sat
    on the floor. had i been diabetic, i could have died because no one stopped --

    the roses had already served their purpose. the girlfriend was able to see how
    much he cared for her, as were her co-workers. (why else would he send them to
    her at work?) once she took them home, the roses would have sat in a vase until
    it was time to throw them out. instead, they brought joy a second time, and she

    my parents told me that a member of their congregation carries a licensed gun
    when he''s in church. he is not a law enforcement officer or a private security
    guard, but keeps the gun on him "for protection." when i asked what the pastor
    has to say about this, i was told, "he doesn''t know or can''t do anything about
    it." i suggested that mom and dad speak to the congregation board of directors
    because they are legally and financially responsible for the church. they refused
    even though they are not happy about this gun issue. my parents have a long history

    a friend of more than 40 years, "myra," delivered a letter to my physician outlining
    her observations of what she claims were "changes" in me. i was called into my
    doctor''s office to respond. myra has also told me i should see a psychiatrist.
    i am disappointed that a friend would say these things about me, and i don''t
    think she should have contacted my doctor without telling me. i have asked others
    if they have noticed any dramatic changes in me and no one else has. myra may

    "ethan" and i have been married 36 years. he''s a good and caring husband, but
    he has a habit that irritates me no end. he opens our mail -- whether it''s addressed
    to him or not. i have nothing to hide and i always show or mention what i receive.
    i don''t open mail that''s addressed to him and would appreciate the courtesy
    of being able to open mail that''s addressed to me. however, ethan won''t stop
    and insists that there is nothing wrong with what he''s doing. i''m about to the

    i''m an athletic, youthful-looking 58, and my son, "barry," is 24. we go out alone
    for dinner quite often because my husband (barry''s father) doesn''t enjoy eating
    in restaurants. my problem is the angry stares my son and i get from younger --
    and older -- women who mistake me for a "cougar" out on a date with my "cub."
    the other night when i left our table to use the restroom, a woman approached
    barry, told him he was "disgusting," and asked, "why don''t you date girls your
    own age?" he informed her that i was his mother, but even if i wasn''t, it was
    none of her business. another time, a girl barry''s age asked him why he was out
    with "an old hag" and said, "how can you want her over me?" this happens every
    time we go out. i dress well and look like i could be in my 40s, but i have to
    wonder about the rudeness and ignorance of someone insulting my son without knowing
    the circumstances of the situation. some of them refused to believe the truth

    i can empathize with "deeply hurt in arizona" (march 16), who travels back to
    her hometown to see her large extended family and struggles to make time for her
    longtime friend "judith," who nonetheless feels slighted. my husband and i grew
    up in the northeast but now live out of state. we have flown hundreds of miles
    with our children to visit our families back there. once we arrived, it seemed
    we were expected to continue traveling from town to town to do all the visiting.
    it became very stressful. these people made little effort to visit us in our state
    or even come to our "base" while we were in their area. while "hurt" visits her
    elderly parents, judith appears to be sitting around waiting for her and making
    little effort. why doesn''t judith go to the parents'' home? or, better yet, have
    a girls'' weekend in arizona or somewhere in between? we have gotten past our
    irritation with family and friends and do two things: 1. we tell people in advance
    when we''re coming so they can make plans. groups -- especially friends -- can
    double up, and see us and see each other. 2. we use our time the way we want and
    not the way we feel we are obligated to. "hurt" should urge judith to try to come

    my husband and i have a 24-year-old developmentally disabled son who lives with

    had a mark on his neck. we were over at a friend''s house for dinner when my best
    friend noticed the mark. she then proceeded to tell me i should consider getting

    i am a hospitalist, a physician who cares for hospitalized patients. when i enter
    a patient''s room, i invariably find the television blaring. usually the patient
    or family members will make no effort to mute the tv, and i must turn it off myself.
    because they are paying me to communicate, i would assume they would want to hear
    what i have to say. occasionally patients have expressed irritation at having
    their tv turned off (they can turn it back on using the bedside control). it seems
    to me that good manners require one to turn off the television or radio or hang
    up the phone when the physician makes rounds. am i wrong? -- hospitalist in the

    i have been married to my wife, "leigh," for seven years. we have two sons, ages
    4 and 2. i love leigh and our sons very much. over the years i became increasingly
    dependent on drinking (beer). i have never been abusive, but leigh expressed concern
    about it. i didn''t think the problem was anything we couldn''t deal with. a little
    over a year ago, leigh''s mother died of cancer. it has been an extremely emotional
    time for her, and she has now decided she can no longer tolerate my behavior.
    she''s not even sure she''s in love with me anymore. hearing her say it made me
    realize how big a deal my drinking is, and i am committed to changing. but after
    a month of trying, leigh still says she would be better off alone. she is starting

    we will visit my in-laws for the holidays next december with our new baby. we
    stay in a hotel when we visit because the in-laws are both chain smokers and i
    am a non-smoker who is sensitive to smoke. this has created some distance between
    my in-laws and me. when we have visited in the past i resigned myself to the fact
    that they will smoke through our dinners and conversations. now that we have a
    little one, i do not want my in-laws to smoke in front of the baby. they don''t
    visit us; we visit them once a year. can i ask that they not smoke in their home

    i have been married to my husband, "ted," for many years. he is a people person
    with close friends of both sexes. i have never had a problem with his having female
    friends because i trust him, and because these women are my friends, too. recently,
    however, a woman i''ll call "ellie" has become infatuated with my husband. at
    least i think she has, and i need an unbiased perspective. ted has a separate
    e-mail account and he has shown me some of her messages. she calls him "dearest"
    and says things like, "you are amazing; you are inspirational; you are my special
    friend; and you rascal, you." he either doesn''t reply or is very careful how
    he does. abby, i sense that ellie is trying to establish a separate relationship
    with ted. he and i have discussed it. he thinks it''s funny and we have joked
    about it, but we''re both becoming uncomfortable around her. we have mutual friends
    we see once a month for dinner. we''d have to explain to them why we want to cut
    off contact with ellie. they may understand because ellie''s flirting has been
    escalating at these dinners. am i being paranoid? -- wondering in washington'

    i''m a 20-year-old female who has been dating my boyfriend, "will," for three

    i think my husband may be a cross-dresser. last night while "roland" and i were
    cuddling in bed, i felt his legs and they were smoother than mine. i asked him
    why he keeps shaving his legs and stomach, and then it dawned on me. roland has
    sent me e-mails hinting about dressing up. one year, he purchased a pair of high
    heels, saying he wanted to dress up like a woman. i examined them the other day
    and there is evidence that they have been worn more than once. my lingerie drawer
    is sometimes a mess, and sometimes my clothes are a bit out of place. i believe
    my husband dresses up while i''m out of town on business trips. i''d kind of like
    to see him dressed up, but i''m afraid he might look sexier than me. lately roland
    has been asking me if he can join me when i go shopping for clothes. he does chores
    around the house (vacuuming, ironing, dishes), and if he enjoys cross-dressing,
    i say he can wear any outfit he wants. how can i tell him i know what he''s doing?

    it saddens me when i hear women complain that men don''t do their fair share around

    ask, "did you put it back up for him?" when a woman says, "he didn''t pick up

    relationship between two loving people, not an opportunity to complain to others
    about perceived abuses. during the 40 years my husband and i have been married,
    we both worked and managed to raise three productive members of society. we have
    a tacit agreement. each of us does absolutely everything possible to keep the

    i am not gay or bisexual, but i''m in love with my boss, who is a female like
    me. she''s 27 and i am 17. she is married and doesn''t know how i feel about her.
    i looked up her address on the internet and got directions to her house. i drive
    by every day -- don''t ask me why. i told her i have a friend who lives on the
    same street that she does, and that i saw her car in the driveway. about a month
    ago, she caught me driving by as she was pulling out of her driveway. two days
    ago, she called my mother -- they have been friends for years -- and asked, "what''s
    wrong with ''janie''? she pulled my address up from a computer. i saw her driving
    past my house." that''s all my mom told me, but how in the heck did she find out?
    i still have the printout in my bedroom, and it''s still in the same position
    it was, so i don''t think my mom saw it and told her about it. only three of my
    closest friends know, and i don''t think they repeated anything because they have
    no reason to -- and they don''t know my boss. what''s going on here? am i going
    crazy? -- found out in florida'

    i recently attended a funeral of someone close. it was a sad time for me, but
    it sparked an idea that may bring comfort to my family and friends when it''s
    my time to go. abby, would it be out of line to make a goodbye video of myself?
    it would include fond memories that would put a smile on someone''s face and allow
    my family and friends to remember me as i was alive, not as i lay in a coffin.
    instead of a plastic bookmark, i could leave a dvd of my final goodbyes. i have
    a health problem and don''t know how long i have, so i''d like to know what you
    and your readers think about my idea. i trust your advice, abby, so please let

    for valentine''s day i bought a dozen red roses and had them delivered to my girlfriend''s
    workplace. on her way home that evening, she made a stop at the grocery store
    and encountered a distraught young man near tears because he couldn''t afford
    to buy flowers for his girlfriend. she offered him money but he refused, so she
    gave him the roses i bought for her. (abby, they had cost me more than $82!) the
    whole episode still has me upset. i know the roses were a gift and she had every
    right to do with them as she wished. but i think what she did was thoughtless
    and insensitive and didn''t take my feelings into consideration. she says i am

    then plan to be there at 8:00 a.m. 5. you will be receiving a lot of information,

    my 15-year-old stepson says he is embarrassed by the constant hand-holding in
    public his mother and i enjoy. he also doesn''t like that we always share a quick
    kiss after saying grace before meals, even in restaurants. he says that none of
    his friends'' parents do it, and he thinks it''s "weird." his mother and i see
    no need to change and feel he will get over his embarrassment in time. we feel
    our displays of affection are appropriate and strengthen our relationship. i would
    also think that seeing us so well-bonded would be reassuring to him and his 14-year-old
    brother. neither boy was close to his father -- in fact, they both hate to visit
    him -- so i don''t think it''s an issue of the boy hoping his parents will get
    back together. any thoughts on this? -- stepdad in pennsylvania'

    i broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years last july because i thought
    i was going to be getting a job overseas and she would be staying in the states.
    we have always had a long-distance relationship (me being from new york and she
    from new hampshire), and it didn''t look like it would be any different for the
    next five or so years what with graduate school, etc. i was becoming more and
    more distant in our relationship because i''d see her only for a weekend every
    other month or so, and the lack of physical contact left me feeling single but
    unavailable. it has been many months now, and it turned out i didn''t get the
    job after all. she''s now living two hours away, and we''re still on good terms.
    we talk occasionally but never about us. our families loved each other, and we
    never had any deal-breaking fights. part of me wants to see if she wants to give
    it another shot, but the other half feels almost embarrassed to ask. what would

    my husband, "hugh," and i have been married 16 years. we generally have a good
    relationship, with few arguments. we seldom participate in activities that don''t
    include each other. three years ago, i was hired to work in the office of a manufacturing
    facility. the majority of the workers are men. although hugh denies it, i suspect
    he''s uncomfortable about it. when i participate in company events for employees
    only, he becomes jealous and rants that it isn''t fair for spouses to be excluded.
    once in a while, my co-workers and i go out for drinks after work. when i''m asked
    to join them, hugh goes on the offensive, demanding to know all the details. he
    then calls my cell phone repeatedly until i get home. i''m hurt that he finds
    me and my associates so untrustworthy. he has met the people i work with and has
    seen that they''re all friendly and happily married. i encourage him to do things

    his job at a critical time out of anger and missed out on some major retraining.
    he kept saying he''d start his own business or get work, but he never did. he
    also never made up for the loss in skills. instead, he stayed home, moped about,
    and now at 56 would have serious difficulty finding a job in his field if he wanted
    to. (i don''t think he really wants to anymore.) roy is not happy or fulfilled

    thing by respecting his wishes to help someone i could save. when i got back and
    talked to his family, they were angry at me for not trying harder to save his
    life. when i signed up for this job, i knew i wouldn''t be able to save everyone,
    but i am supposed to try my best no matter who it is i am saving. was i wrong
    by going to another man who i could save? was it wrong of me to take his letter

    i can''t stand my 10-year-old daughter. i was an 18-year-old single mother when

    "pretty" she is, but i can''t see it. i dread when she comes home from school.

    my workplace has instituted "casual dress friday," where everyone is supposed
    to make a donation to a charity selected by a different employee each fortnight.
    while this is nice in theory, i often find that i don''t wish to donate to the
    chosen charity because i don''t agree with its ethics or its methods. i give regularly
    to charities of my choice, which i have researched beforehand, but have never
    been one to donate automatically to every passing collection. how do i bow out
    gracefully when the collection tin comes around? i have tried to explain to my
    co-workers why i don''t support a particular charity and simply say i have chosen
    not to participate. i am met with blank stares and demands that i explain myself,
    and lectures about why i must "support the team." i don''t feel my colleagues
    have any right to tell me what i should do with my money, but they obviously disagree
    and i am finding the situation very uncomfortable. any suggestions? -- feeling

    i got them -- running off an elevator before the door had opened all the way,
    tripping while climbing some stairs, and crashing into the coffee table and nearly
    breaking my leg. my friends exchanged knowing looks and told me if i ever needed

    would stay home and baby-sit my new stepdaughter. i felt i had no say in the matter,

    "oscar" and i have been married for three years. we have had many ups and downs
    and a few near-separations, but we''re now on a better path and working hard on
    our relationship. because my friends have seen the rocky times oscar and i have
    been through, they are not as nice to him as i''d like. in particular, this applies
    to my best friend, "tish," and her husband. i have tried many times to get us
    together on double dates, but they always refuse. they socialize with other couples,
    but refuse to associate with oscar and me beyond birthday and holiday celebrations.
    i''d love to have my friends and my husband all together for other social functions.
    what can i do, if anything? -- in the middle in south carolina'

    i crave certain foods sometimes. my doctor said that when you crave a food, it
    means your body needs something that''s contained in the food -- such as salt
    on pretzels. my grandmother thinks whenever i say i''m craving a food that i''m
    pregnant. i have tried to explain to her that i''m not -- that sometimes when
    your body needs a certain vitamin or mineral, people crave foods that are high
    in it. my grandmother insists that my doctor is wrong and doesn''t know what she
    is talking about. she says the only time a woman craves a certain food is when
    she''s pregnant. unlike my doctor, my grandmother has not been to medical school.

    introductions, i followed her into the kitchen and offered to do what i could

    and then she pointed to a poem she had framed and hung on her wall. the title
    was, "stay out of my kitchen," and she told me it had come from your "keepers"
    booklet. edye passed away two years ago, and the poem now hangs in my sister-in-law''s
    kitchen. i think of my dear mother-in-law every time i see it. how can i get some

    it''s tax season, and once again, my husband and i are faced with our annual "conflict."
    we buy a tax program for our computer and do our own taxes. every year, one of
    our daughters has my husband do her taxes. after he completes them, he returns
    the forms so she and her husband can sign them. the problem is, they never pay
    the taxes they owe. my daughter and son-in-law owe thousands of dollars, and i
    know they risk being audited by the irs. if that happens, i am sure the kids will
    say that my husband actually did the taxes, which could draw us into their problem.
    it might even target us to be audited. i don''t want to be dragged into this potential
    problem. my husband thinks i''m being silly and borrowing trouble unnecessarily.

    i sympathize with "stumped for an answer" (dec. 22), the man who was speechless
    when a woman objected to his opening the door for her. haven''t we all experienced
    "moments after," wishing we''d found the right words at the right time? my son
    -- a high school sophomore -- had a timely response in a similar circumstance.
    we had stopped at a grocery store for a couple of items and were walking toward
    the exit. just ahead was a woman carrying three large bags. my son stepped up
    to open the door for her, and in a strident voice she said, "listen, sonny, i
    can handle the door myself!" my boy answered with a polite smile and a pleasant
    tone of voice: "i''m sorry. i''ll excuse your rudeness if you''ll forgive my courtesy."

    as a child, it was painfully obvious that my mother favored my brother, "clint,"
    over me. everything he did was considered perfect and was bragged about. because
    i was a girl, i was expected to step and fetch for him. to this day, my opinions
    hold no weight against those of my brother. i have always been hurt by this, but
    i have lived with it. clint moved 3,000 miles away years ago. i am the one caring
    for mom, although clint contributes financial assistance. when he and his family
    came to visit for a week, my daughter asked me why grandma respects and is prouder
    of clint''s children -- all boys -- than of her. grandma is proud that one of
    the boys knows about computers, but my daughter has built computers. grandma is
    proud because one of the boys is studying piano. my daughter has played flute

    the other day i asked my husband a question and told him to be honest. if given
    a choice between giving up wine or giving up sex with me, which would he choose?
    you guessed it. he said, "giving up sex with you." i think i knew the answer before
    i asked the question, but hearing it out loud devastated me. i know every woman

    my wife and i threw a party for which we hired a bartender, so we could spend
    more time with our guests. we figured that, in addition to his hourly rate, we
    would tip him at the end of the night. without consulting us, the man placed a
    plastic cup out for our guests to tip him. my wife was appalled and demanded that
    he remove it. he actually argued with her, but finally put the tip cup away. my
    wife and i asked friends to weigh in on the subject. the men had no problem with
    the practice, while every woman found it offensive. were we too harsh? should

    my boyfriend recently moved in with me. we have a great relationship except that
    he is always slapping me on the bottom. he refers to it as "love taps." i have
    told him many times i regard it as degrading and frustrating. it stings and i
    hate it. i have told him 10 different times in 10 different ways, including getting
    so angry i screamed obscenities at him. when we get into little arguments, he
    will say, "that''s it! you deserve a spanking for that!" and proceeds to hit me
    again. i know he thinks it''s cute, and he obviously gets some sort of enjoyment
    out of it, but i am at my wits'' end. how can i get it through his head that his
    behavior is not only offensive, it is seriously harming our relationship by creating
    resentment? does he just not care about my feelings, or does he not take me seriously
    when i tell him to knock it off? -- sore in california'

    i take the shuttle bus from work along with a group of others from the same company.
    last week, i got out of work a little early and was already sitting on the bus
    when the others boarded. not realizing that i was there, a man who works in another
    department -- whom i do not know well -- said loudly, "i don''t think that old
    lady is here today." abby, i am not yet 60, and he is older than i am! i know
    that for a fact. his remark was within earshot of the other workers and the driver.
    needless to say, i was deeply upset and humiliated. in fact, i wrote a letter

    someone said something to me today that really offended me. i let her know she
    had hurt my feelings and her response was, "i''m sorry you took what i said the
    wrong way." (abby, there was no other way to interpret it!) essentially, she made
    it my fault because i was "too sensitive." if i said something that hurt someone''s
    feelings, i would simply say, "i apologize. i didn''t mean to hurt you." when
    you try to justify your actions and blame the other person for taking offense
    there really is no apology forthcoming -- which only makes the situation worse.

    after my mother died two years ago, my sisters and i divided up her household
    items, parceling out equally objects of material and sentimental value. one item,
    which went to my younger sister, "beth," was a brightly colored handmade native
    american rug our parents bought in the 1950s in arizona. it had been displayed
    prominently for decades on a wall in the house where we three children grew up.
    i visited beth recently and was shocked to see that she had taken the rug out
    of storage and was using it as a floor rug in her family room. i shuddered to
    think of the damage that a daily trample by her three little kids, she and her
    husband and a sadly incontinent dog will do to this family treasure. i politely
    asked her to reconsider and find somewhere else to display it. if she couldn''t,
    i offered to trade it for something of her choice from my parcel of the family
    possessions. beth took offense, reminding me that it is, after all, a rug, and
    that it now belongs to her. emphasizing that her small house has limited wall
    space, she implied that i was trying to get the rug for myself. she feels my desire
    to see it displayed is no more valid than hers to see it used. am i wrong in thinking
    she should not trash this heirloom? -- sentimental in hartford, conn.'

    my birthday is in two months, and it''s a "big" one. as of today, two people --
    a close friend and my mother -- felt the need to tell me that "someone" has planned
    a surprise birthday party for me. i am disgusted that they spoiled the surprise.
    why would someone want to take the joy out of something that way? i will do my
    best to act surprised, but it won''t be the same. abby, please tell your readers

    our wedding had been "an embarrassment," and she wished she hadn''t invited any

    my older brother, "gabe," 51, lives in another state. he calls me and my other
    brother often, asking our advice and opinions on everything -- work, parenting
    and his relationships. his current relationship is like all the others have been.
    he either picks the wrong person or he is the wrong person. what concerns me is
    that after torturing my brother and me for hours at a time, gabe then calls our
    70-year-old mother. he subjects her to long, circular conversations and never
    takes any of our advice. despite our requests for him to stop burdening us all,
    especially mom, gabe persists. mom is losing sleep, and she''s very upset because
    gabe is unhappy and because he talks to her long into the night. she doesn''t
    want to hurt his feelings, but she''s reached her limit. gabe sought professional
    help a few years ago, when he was having the same problem with a different woman.

    the dollar amount or tell them what each guest gave at our wedding? they call

    i had to respond to "blushing in san francisco" (nov. 21), the 11-year-old girl
    who''s embarrassed because her mother sings and dances in the mall. i was that
    mother a few years ago. my daughter and i shopped in trendy stores where the music
    was really loud, and when she saw me bob my head and move to the music, she would
    shake her head "no." i''d do it again -- just to torture her. as she tried on
    clothes, she would pop out and say, "have you been dancing again? this is a no-dancing
    zone!" we laugh about it now. when i teach, i tell my students what i did. they
    tell me unanimously that they would die if i were their mom -- to which i respond
    that it''s my job to make them miserable. as the bee gees sang, "you should be

    when my daughter was about 8, i was walking her to the door of her school and

    i have chosen to celebrate my children''s birthdays with family and one friend.
    i want my children to understand early on that birthdays are not about getting
    loads of gifts, but to celebrate life with family. we are invited to many parties
    for their friends and classmates, but i have always chosen to attend only those
    of our close friends. i find it disheartening to watch children these days rip
    into a bunch of gifts and toss them aside without saying thank you or even commenting
    on the gift. it''s all about the next package and the volume. because of this,
    i''m considering no longer giving a gift but making a donation to a charity in
    honor of the birthday boy or girl instead. but i''m worried about the reaction
    i''ll get from friends. on the other hand, i feel much better about donating to
    a worthwhile charity instead of another toy for children who already have so much

    i have been arguing with my husband over something, and i hope you can settle

    for the last three years i have been dating a woman who, 15 years ago, divorced
    an army colonel after 20 years of marriage. she loved the prestige of being an
    officer''s wife. there always seems to be a reason why she must mention her ex,
    no matter what the topic is. i finally told her it seemed like she missed him.
    now, instead of saying his name, she says, "when we were in germany, we did this
    ..." or, "when we lived in idaho we used to ..." no matter what i say, she never
    fails to find a way to tell a story about life with her ex. i am an army vet and
    i cannot mention anything about the army because if i do, she''ll one-up me with
    yet another war story about him. and when we are together in public, she never
    misses a chance to disclose that we do not live together, and she always speaks

    to quit. after we had a huge fight, she finally threw my ring back at me. i stayed
    single for a couple of years and then met a woman and began slowly dating her.
    the first year our relationship was good, but over the next three years the same
    issues arose and i was hearing, "you''re selfish." "you don''t love me." "grow

    i''m not ready to give up on it yet. both these women continue to call and text

    my mom has recently retired and is spending a lot of time at our home. she''s
    constantly doing things -- emptying the washer, drying dishes. anything that is
    untouched for a few minutes she''ll get into. she also reorganizes our drawers
    and cabinets and thinks her way is best. she even remakes the children''s beds,
    which is part of their chores. she feels a bed needs to "air" for an hour after
    its occupant wakes up. when i tell her she doesn''t need to do it, she says she
    doesn''t mind -- but she''s missing the point. mom is hurt because she feels i
    don''t appreciate her, and i am hurt that she doesn''t respect my rules. i''m

    and enjoy her retirement while she''s at our home. what should i do? -- frustrated

    my problem is the relationship i have with my brother. we''re both in our 40s

    lives alone in the house we grew up in. she has lived by herself for more than
    20 years. although she''s very active, the house has become a burden. she and
    i have talked about selling it and her moving to a senior residence close to me.
    she is thrilled with the idea. i am afraid my brother will make a fuss and try
    to discourage the process, since mom would be moving out of state. i''ll be going

    that depress me. if my mind fills with clouds, i will chase them away and fill
    it with sunshine. just for today: i will accept what is. i will face reality.
    i will correct those things that i can correct and accept those i cannot. just
    for today: i will improve my mind. i will read something that requires effort,
    thought and concentration. i will not be a mental loafer. just for today: i will
    make a conscious effort to be agreeable. i will be kind and courteous to those
    who cross my path, and i''ll not speak ill of others. i will improve my appearance,
    speak softly, and not interrupt when someone else is talking. just for today,
    i will refrain from improving anybody but myself. just for today: i will do something
    positive to improve my health. if i''m a smoker, i''ll quit. if i am overweight,
    i will eat healthfully -- if only just for today. and not only that, i will get
    off the couch and take a brisk walk, even if it''s only around the block. just
    for today: i will gather the courage to do what is right and take responsibility

    i''m an independent, never-married woman who has been holding out for the right
    man. i finally found him in "wayne," a 49-year-old widower with two adult daughters.
    wayne and i have been together for a year -- living together for six months --
    but his daughters still refuse to meet me. wayne says they need time because they
    lost their mother only two years ago and aren''t ready to accept anyone else in
    his life. the rest of his family has been welcoming and sweet. i''m invited to
    some family functions, but allowed to attend only those that wayne''s daughters
    won''t be at. i feel like i am able to share only part of his life and nothing
    will move forward until his children accept me. i love wayne. i have searched

    never do? -- on the sidelines'

    while driving the streets and highways, we communicate in many ways with our fellow

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    after a long battle with cancer, my beloved mother died. after we got over the
    initial shock of mom''s passing, we were looking through her room. it had always
    been ingrained in us not to snoop through mom''s things, so there were some feelings
    of guilt when we did it. on her dresser was an old jewelry box one of us had given
    her for christmas years ago. it was a ratty old thing covered in white vinyl,
    its embossed gold paint long gone. the latch was rusty, but we finally managed
    to get it open. there was no jewelry inside. instead, nestled in the threadbare
    red velveteen, were the treasures of a lifetime of loving. there were the hospital
    bracelets each of us had worn as infants, a lock of my baby hair, the first mother''s
    day card ever given to her, an old school photo of me framed in popsicle sticks,
    a gift card written to her by my father before we were born along with other items
    that probably wouldn''t be worth 50 cents to anyone else. but they were priceless
    to our mother. my sister and i were amazed. our mom knew that love isn''t something
    you wait for or something that comes to you from elsewhere, but rather that it''s
    a behavior, a way of being in the world. her personal treasures were evidence
    not of the love she''d received, but tokens of the love she had given. we decided
    to assemble a scrapbook of these treasures, to be kept for a year by each of us
    then passed along to the others as a christmas gift each holiday. please tell
    your readers that in the end, all that matters is the love you give. that is our
    mother''s legacy to us, and it will ultimately be her legacy to her great-grandchildren.
    this christmas, while missing our mother, we will smile through our tears, remembering
    how her face would be alight with love on christmas morning at the sight of us
    opening the gifts she''d left under the tree. and isn''t that the greatest gift
    we could ask for? -- grateful son in corpus christi, texas'

    i have been happily married for more than 20 years. i joined an online social
    network to keep in touch with family, friends and my kids who are in college.
    i love the convenience, but i''m in a quandary. a number of men from my past (some
    i dated and some not) have contacted me online with their phone numbers and asked
    me to call them. i was flattered at first, but now i think phone communication
    would be inviting trouble. i politely inform friends who push the issue that i''m
    happy to catch up online, but out of respect for my husband and my marriage i
    don''t call men who send me their numbers. most of them then drop further attempts
    at communication; others do not. my problem is it continues to happen. i don''t
    remember being that popular when i was young, so it has caught me off guard. i
    suspended my account several times, but reactivated it because i miss the connection
    with extended family and friends. i''m getting turned off to responding to any
    "friend" requests anymore because it seems that most men just want to recapture
    some youthful fantasy. how do i handle this? -- blast from the past'

    my mother, eleanor, passed away last aug. 30. she spent her long life helping
    others. during her eulogy, i described her by saying, "her best lesson, the one
    she modeled for us, is that a selfless life devoted to family and others, is the
    highest example of god''s work here on earth." after the funeral, my brother mentioned
    that the one thing mom had wanted read during her service was an item she had
    saved from a column of yours that was published in 1999. it eloquently captures
    the essence of bigotry and lack of compassion in our society. although we have
    made significant inroads on eradicating prejudice, i found it still timely. would
    you please print it again? -- ellie''s daughter in seattle'

    a friend and i were talking about how wimpy a lot of guys in our generation are.

    because they have told our friends they''d like to date us again. but then they
    don''t call. try as we might to give them chances to ask us out, they usually

  body: dear abby; my son and daughter-in-law live like pigs. neither one of them
    was raised that way. they live in a beautiful home that literally smells like
    a litter box. i would look the other way or not visit, but now they have four
    children. not only are my grandchildren unkempt and dirty -- dirty clothes, smelly
    shoes, unwashed hair -- but my son and his wife foist their parenting duties off
    on their daughter, who's only 10. it's her job to get her brothers up and bathed,
    changed, dressed and fed so mom and dad can sleep late. the poor girl is exhausted
    all the time. she doesn't always have the time to brush her own hair/teeth before
    school. she's often made fun of. my son sees nothing wrong with these "chores,"
    and i'm afraid to say anything because i know my daughter-in-law will cut me off
    from the kids. what's sad is my son allows it. am i crazy? please help. -- desperate

    this letter is to offer sympathy to "trish in louisiana" (sept. 25), who was seated
    next to two large passengers on a three-hour flight. it has happened to me. the
    airlines control the size and weight of baggage, whether it''s checked or carry-on,
    and charge when it''s overweight. so why do they turn a blind eye when it comes
    to passengers who must endure being crowded out of the seats we have paid for?
    if airlines aren''t willing to screen passengers for size, perhaps they should
    provide a few rows of larger seats to accommodate them. airlines have sacrificed
    comfort for economy to the point that the seats are simply too small. i''m an
    average-size woman, but i find the seats are barely large enough. they''re crowded
    so close together you can''t move your legs, and they don''t actually recline.
    i agree with your advice to speak up if you find yourself being squeezed. -- ellen

    i have heard of interventions for drug and alcohol addicts. could i stage one

    she and our grandson live with us because her marriage broke up. i am becoming
    the boy''s default mother because aileen is constantly texting or spending hours
    on facebook. she''ll say, "i have to send a quick message," then reappear an hour
    later. by then, we have fed our grandson and changed his diaper. when i try to
    discuss this with her, she says her work requires this constant communication,
    but i know it doesn''t. there have been times when aileen''s feelings have been
    hurt because her son doesn''t want to go someplace with her and prefers to stay
    with us instead. i suspect that he feels ignored when he''s with her because her

    i want you to know how much i agree with your answer to "paying for my popcorn

    i used to teach a parenting class to parents who had kids in trouble with the
    law. i started out by asking, "how many of you teach your children to lie, cheat
    or steal?" of course nobody admitted they did. i then had about 20 items i''d
    list, the movie food issue being one, driving over the speed limit, and so on.
    at least one of the 20 applied to everybody. then i''d say: "you taught your kids
    that it was ok to lie, cheat and steal -- it''s only getting caught that''s bad.
    that''s why you are in my class today." this is what that niece is teaching her

    for a family of four to see a movie and get a drink and popcorn or candy costs
    about $80. this is highway robbery. the cost of a drink is about 5 or 10 cents

    be serious. how much does popcorn cost? a tub of popcorn at a theater is $7.50.
    my children want the whole theater experience, which includes a snack. how can

    she starts horrible arguments with our parents and me. i have tried to help out
    and watch her kids when i could, but i have a full schedule and need to make time
    for my other relationships. after being threatened a couple of times, i finally
    stopped talking to her because i was tired of turning the other cheek to her outrageous,
    violent behavior. i love my twin and miss our close relationship. i understand
    the stress of being an unemployed, single mother of two, but i can''t continue
    putting up with the weekly arguments. is there any hope we can be close again?
    gwen was in counseling for a while. what can i do to help resolve things without
    turning into a doormat again? -- mirror image in south carolina'

    i''m 14 and i''m terrified that i won''t know what to do once i''m in college
    and have to decide on a long-term job. i have a lot of interests, but none that
    would lead me toward a career. my teachers and the books i read say i should find
    my passion and follow it for the rest of my life. my problem is, i don''t have
    a stand-out passion i love intensely. i have an amazing family who would support
    me in any direction i choose, but i don''t know what that would be. i get good
    grades and work hard, and i believe i could achieve anything i choose. the problem
    is, i don''t know what i want to do. i know i''m young, but i worry all the time
    about my future and being stuck in a job i hate. i''m involved in lots of activities
    -- student government, piano lessons, sports, service clubs and more -- and i
    enjoy all of them. but none of them inspire a burning passion. do you have any
    suggestions on how to find my passion? -- needs a direction, atlanta'

    i have been with my husband for more than 10 years. it has been rocky over the
    past few years, and i recently had an affair with a married man. i have fallen
    madly in love with him, and every night i dream about being with him instead of
    with my husband. we''re both in unhappy marriages and both have children. he''s
    worried that if he gets divorced he won''t be able to see his kids as often as
    he wants. should i forget him and try to fall back in love with my husband? everyone
    i talk to about this says my lover has been what i needed to recognize that i
    wasn''t happy in my marriage and that i deserve better. i know i deserve better
    because i worshipped the ground my husband walked on for many years and got treated
    like crud. what do i do? -- downtrodden wife in oklahoma.'
