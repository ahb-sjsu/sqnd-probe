    many years ago, you printed a letter from a young mother whose husband was serving

    her husband''s picture. i am getting the same argument from my mother-in-law because

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    is it possible to justify a business-expense deduction for a trip to a funeral?
    a man flew to europe to attend his wife''s rites, at which he met many business
    contacts, and also visited others during the balance of his stay abroad. the tax
    court''s response: "we cannot believe that the funeral was incidental, and business
    was the primary motive for the trip." a skeptical tax court took a similar tack
    with arnold h. feldman, a philadelphia rabbi who invited his entire congregation
    to his son''s bar mitzvah reception. he deducted the cost of the event, attended
    by 700, of whom 100 were friends and relatives. a bar mitzvah reception, the rabbi
    urged the court, "may to the lawyer be a personal or social event; to the rabbi
    serving in a congregation it is an integral part of his professional activities."
    the court disagreed and denied the deduction. it said the rabbi "stands in no
    better a tax position than anyone else who invites a large number of people to
    a family celebration and has in mind the idea that the invitations might enhance
    either an existing business relationship or a hoped-for business relationship."
    tip: this decision does not mean the court is unwilling to ever allow a family
    celebration to qualify as a business expense. but the court''s unsympathetic approach
    underscores just how hard it can be to justify a deduction for a gathering that
    by its very nature is primarily personal, not business.'

    him "jerry." for the last three years, we have been raising jerry's 10-year-old
    daughter with little or no help from him. jerry is now in the process of divorce,
    and he's moved into our den. he is bright, intelligent and artistically gifted,
    but he suffers from low self-esteem and sees no reason to look for a full-time
    job. when he does work, it's a part-time job and he's paid under the table. our
    garage is so full of his personal belongings, we can't park our car inside. jerry
    has been jailed twice, and i have reason to believe he is using drugs. i empathize
    with my wife when she says she feels a strong obligation to help her son. she
    says she loves him, and he's welcome to stay as long as he wants. i say jerry
    is old enough to get out and fend for himself. he will never learn responsibility
    and self-reliance if he doesn't have to. i am more than willing to continue taking
    care of his daughter, since my wife and i are in a better position to provide
    a safe and caring environment for her. what do you think? we will abide by your

  body: dear abby--i am hoping you can settle a family dispute between my two daughters
    and me. their father and i were divorced after 44 years of marriage. the grounds
    were adultery. he had carried on an affair with sandra (not her real name) for
    16 years. i was aware of it for the last eight years because he openly flaunted
    it by taking her on trips and cruises all over the world. i tried to cope with
    it, hoping he would come to his senses. he didn't want a divorce because he didn't
    want to share the estate we had built up over the years, which was considerable.
    four days after our divorce was final, he married sandra--and two months after
    that, our daughters entertained her in their homes and introduced her to all our
    relatives! now i no longer feel comfortable in our daughters' homes. they tell
    me to get professional help or i will end up a bitter and lonely old woman. my
    friends tell me i am handling it well. what do you suggest? nameless, please

    some time ago, my husband, "al," took a notion to buy property in a nearby state.
    he has a tendency to be depressed, and i have a tendency to say yes to make him
    happy. so, seven years and $70,000 borrowed dollars later, we own a family cabin
    in west virginia. al is now semi-retired, and it''s the center of his world. my
    problem: he expects me to accompany him and share his enthusiasm for the place,
    but i''m no more interested in it than i am in the man in the moon. i''m quite
    happy staying home and pursuing my own interests, which are many. (none of them
    involves "fooling around.") when i''m at the cabin, i feel isolated, trapped and
    homesick. al is so attached to the place that he takes my rejection of it personally.
    surely i''m not the only wife in a long marriage (35 years) whose husband finds
    a new pastime--golf, a boat, bridge--and insists that his wife go along with it.

    the letter signed "computer widow" grabbed my attention because i, too, am a computer

    has some deeper problems, but i also think a little less nagging would improve
    the situation. the more you harp, the more they shut you out. erik and i are very
    happy together, and he does spend time with me. but i also understand that he

    if only half the stories i have heard are true, violence and intimidation against
    officials at amateur sporting events is a serious problem. if i were "retired
    ump in atlanta," i would have had any player who broke my nose with a punch arrested
    for assault and battery. from your answer, i must assume that you have never been
    in a serious fight with someone hitting your face hard enough to break bones.
    it is not funny--and gender has nothing to do with it. it is sad and strange when
    somebody who does the right thing is ridiculed as a wimp while the jerk of a ballplayer
    who attacked him is probably still on the team. "retired ump''s" fellow officials
    should have walked off the field, taken their comrade to the emergency room, and
    left two teams wondering how to finish the game with no officiating crew. tell
    "retired ump" that any idiot can get in a fight. it takes a real man to walk away
    from one. (and if his friend thought that fighting was such a good idea, why didn''t
    he jump into the fray?) a.t.d. in seattle'

    the amazon who struck "retired ump in atlanta" shouldn''t be traded to the giants;
    she should be sitting in jail for assault and battery! can you imagine the hue
    and cry that would have gone up if a male player had struck a female umpire, even
    if the man were smaller than the woman? what makes it different in "retired ump''s"
    case? the argument that men are more physically powerful than women can''t be
    used because, in this case, the woman was stronger physically. no matter how many
    civilized societies teach gentlemen from childhood that they should not hit women,
    being female is not a license to beat and abuse others. violence is wrong no matter
    who''s doing it. a peaceful woman near atlanta'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    you recently asked, "readers, what has given you comfort when you were confronted
    by tragedy?" a myriad of "pat" answers crossed my mind, but then i remembered
    a thought i had shared with my pastor soon after the oklahoma city bombing. what
    comforted me the most was seeing how, when in the midst of disaster, people came
    together. racial biases disappeared; language barriers were replaced with the
    universal language of love and comfort; and ordinary citizens took on the roles
    of heroes. if only for a short period of time, we saw each other for who we really
    are: human beings, each and every one. beneath the color of our skins or the origins
    of our birth, we all bleed red blood, cry salty tears, and have hearts that break
    in despair when a loved one is threatened with pain or death. it gives me tremendous
    hope that someday it will not take a monstrous tragedy to bring out all that is
    good within us. could it be that the god of all creation allows such things to
    happen to remind us that he created us to be our brothers'' keepers? lynne arnold,

    in a small town several miles away where everyone knew everyone. the single men
    were lacking in the qualities i was looking for in a man--so i placed an ad. i
    received letters from some very nice men, a couple of jerks and a man who described
    himself as "toothless" and wanted to live so far out in the country, it would
    take a whole day to drive into town. (i hope he found someone.) i told my mother
    that we met through "a mutual friend," but later i felt uncomfortable about the
    deception and i told her the truth. when people ask how we met and we say through

    you asked what comforted readers when they were confronted with tragedy: several

    with one of the women jurors, i was devastated. we had three teenaged children,
    and he had been the light of my life, and now he had betrayed me. as i sat thinking
    about it, it was as though god was asking me, "who do you think you are, putting
    limits on my love? my son died on the cross for your sins and also for the sin
    your husband committed. if i can forgive him, you can, too." i replied, "yes,

    i''m a 70-year-old widower, retired, financially secure and generally in good
    health. most of my friends are women, but i also have male friends. i go out with
    half a dozen women ranging in age from 40 to 70. some i''ve known for a long time.
    all of these relationships are platonic (that is, non-sexual). naturally, most
    women wonder why i''ve never "made a pass" at them. (one complained that our relationship
    was "going nowhere.") the answer: i am sexually impotent; hence, i avoid giving
    the impression that i have any romantic interest in them. i assume that in most
    cases, part of the attraction between men and women is the possibility that a
    sexual union might take place. while i have not polled any members of the female
    sex, i am under the impression that sexual urges in women do not vanish at age
    60, 65 or even 75. at times, i feel that i should inform my female friends that
    i am impotent, so they should not expect sex. but such information is very personal
    and somewhat embarrassing. i suspect that some of my women friends would be relieved
    to know that i am impotent, and there is nothing wrong with them . any thoughts

    i often wondered about my husband''s late night meetings and frequent weekend
    business trips. when i questioned him and let him know that i suspected there
    was another womanin his life, he called me foolish and paranoid. recently, he
    had an operation, and of course was sedated. after a mixup with the hospital rooms,
    i finally found his room. as i approached his room, a floor nurse said, "thank
    goodness you''re here. you must be rita..his wife. he''s been calling your name
    for hours." well, my name is peggy, and i don''t even know a rita, but he must.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    arthur donald delacy would have--by all rights, should have--turned 65 a week
    ago yesterday. instead, the redheaded chicago kid who had always wanted to fly
    was swallowed up by the korean war more than 40 years ago. in a sense, art delacy
    was fortunate, because his memory was kept alive, and because it helped bring
    about the korean war veterans memorial, which will be dedicated thursday in washington,
    d.c. how that came to be is a story of what curiosity, dedication and luck can
    accomplish. as a child on the northwest side, art''s energy and mischievousness
    got him into trouble more than once, like the time he managed to disassemble part
    of his crib and escape, recalls his sister, barbara heinrich of schaumburg. the
    two children were raised by their mother, myrtle, who was divorced from their
    father. art''s disposition had settled down by the time he entered lane tech high
    school, recalls june o''meara, a cousin. "he got all the hell out of him while
    he was younger," o''meara says. one trait he always kept, both women agree, was
    his love of airplanes. "he wanted to be a pilot so much," heinrich says. "all
    of his life, that''s what he wanted to do." realizing that dream in the marine
    corps became a roundabout path for delacy. in the spring of 1948, barely out of
    high school, he joined the national guard, but because he was underage his mother
    had to give her permission. why not, with world war ii three years in the past?
    a few months later, after he turned 18, he enlisted in the marines, but there
    was a potential problem with getting into pilot training: delacy was partly deaf
    in one ear. "somehow he passed the test," heinrich recalls. "he faked it, just
    to get in." in the fall of 1951, one of the last positional battles of the korean
    war was being fought near a series of rugged hills that became known as heartbreak
    ridge. second lt. art delacy had just arrived in korea. on oct. 7, one of marine
    fighter squadron 323''s missions was to cut a road that the enemy was using to
    bring supplies to its front-line troops on heartbreak. delacy was assigned to
    that mission. as the four f-4u corsairs approached the target area, delacy''s
    plane was hit, and he bailed out over the bowl-shaped valley between the allied
    and the communist forces. maj. edward l. barker, a helicopter pilot, texan and
    fellow marine, volunteered to attempt a rescue and was on the scene within 15
    minutes. he soon spotted delacy in a foxhole, pinned down by enemy automatic-weapons
    fire. but when the chopper lowered a rescue line, delacy was unable to grab it.
    under constant fire, barker circled back twice more to try to pick up delacy.
    on his fourth try, the foxhole was empty. a ground patrol that later tried to
    find the downed pilot was also driven back by enemy fire. delacy disappeared forever.
    it wasn''t until march 8, 1954, months after the war ended, that the marine corps
    confirmed a "finding of death" in delacy''s case. barbara heinrich remembers coming
    home from work that day to find that her mother had gotten the telegram. even
    2 1/2 years after her brother''s disappearance, it was hard news. to this day,
    heinrich isn''t sure when--if ever--her mother gave up hope that her son might
    still be found alive. after a point, she says, "you just don''t talk about it
    anymore." there things stood for years. art delacy was one of more than 8,000
    americans missing in action in korea and presumed dead. in 1979, myrtle delacy
    died. a year or two ago, june o''meara''s son, mark, started to get interested
    in family history. growing up, he''d always heard about his mom''s cousin who
    was shot down and killed in korea. mark, who lives in arlington heights, started
    to get into genealogical research. he had no way of knowing that, hundreds of
    miles away, someone else had been holding on to art delacy''s memory for a long
    time. edward barker, the pilot of the rescue helicopter, survived the korean war
    and later retired from the marines as a highly decorated lieutenant colonel. his
    highest medal was a silver star for the attempt to save delacy. like many veterans,
    he never felt comfortable talking about his war experiences and shared very little
    with his family. his younger son, hal, in particular, felt a great curiosity about
    the war. in 1979, frustrated by his father''s silence, he wrote to marine corps
    headquarters and received a copy of the silver star citation. he read about delacy,
    and the abortive rescue attempt, and the enemy bullets smacking into his father''s
    helicopter. three years later, hal and his father finally talked about korea.
    the retired pilot described seeing delacy lying on the ground, his parachute beside
    him, and summed up the experience in four words: "i couldn''t get him." more interested
    in delacy than ever, hal contacted the 23rd infantry regiment association. the
    23rd, part of the army''s second division, had captured heartbreak ridge at a
    cost of more than 800 casualties. hal wound up being invited to the 23rd''s 1982
    reunion, in port washington, n.y. a journeyman carpenter with a degree in history,
    he had never served in the military, having been rejected twice for poor eyesight.
    sitting at a table with some veterans of heartbreak ridge, he asked if anyone
    remembered seeing a helicopter rescue. they sure did; some had been only 200 yards
    from it. one recalled the chopper rushing by overhead, while another remembered
    hearing bullets hit the rescue craft and seeing pieces fly off. a third described
    cheers when the chopper flew off toward base; the hundreds of watching american
    soldiers had thought the rescue had been successful. later that year, barker started
    trying to find delacy''s next of kin. over the years, he contacted anyone he thought
    could help: the marine corps, lane tech, the chicago historical society, the tribune,
    dear abby, even the archdiocese of chicago, on the chance that delacy was catholic.
    some tried to help, and some didn''t, but no one had any information. in working
    to understand his own father, hal barker had come to realize that korea was a
    war many americans had forgotten. the reunion helped seal his conviction that
    korean war veterans deserved their own memorial in washington. arthur donald delacy
    became a symbol of that war and an icon for barker''s efforts to establish a memorial.
    "i tried to conceive of being downed on that ridgeline, knowing that i might be
    captured by an enemy who would probably kill me, and painfully," barker says.
    "when i discovered the marine corps had no information whatsoever in the delacy
    file relating to his capture, i thought about a life extinguished without a trace
    . . . forgotten forever." in december 1984, with assistance from the american
    battle monuments commission, an independent federal agency, hal barker founded
    the korean war memorial trust fund. he and bill temple, a friend and korean war
    vet from philadelphia, made the first donations, and barker made his, $10, in
    arthur delacy''s name. the trust fund became the vehicle through which all $17
    million for the memorial was eventually raised. even if the money could be raised,
    the building of a memorial had to be authorized. so the next step was to generate
    interest on capitol hill, where the mood regarding a memorial for a war that was
    more than 30 years past was often lukewarm. in 1986, however, fate intervened
    in the form of clint eastwood, who was filming the movie "heartbreak ridge." word
    got out that eastwood''s character, a marine, supposedly won a medal of honor
    there as a young man, though the battle was an army operation. korean war vets,
    as well as both of the barkers, raised some dust over the inaccuracy, and in response,
    eastwood made some small script changes and privately lobbied some members of
    congress to support the memorial. on oct. 28, 1986, president reagan signed the
    korean war veterans memorial act, with the trust fund as sole recipient of all
    donations. (the korean war veterans memorial advisory board, later formed to guide
    the design and construction of the memorial, excluded non-veterans, so hal barker
    has not been involved with that phase.) in february 1989, barker received permission
    from the south korean government to visit heartbreak ridge, which is now deep
    in the demilitarized zone separating the two koreas. he stood on hill 931, the
    area''s tallest peak, and saw the spot where delacy was shot down. one of the
    south korean army officers who were escorting him was moved by the story about
    the young american who died to help keep korea free, and gave barker a set of
    buddhist prayer beads to present to delacy''s family, should he ever find them.
    on a monday evening this past may, 36-year-old mark o''meara accessed the internet''s
    world wide web and started looking for anything on the korean war. he figured
    he might one day find something about his cousin art. almost immediately, he found
    barker''s home page for the korean war project (less than)http://www.onramp.net/(tilde)hbarker(greater
    than). there he found this dedication: "in memory of second lieutenant arthur
    donald delacy , u.s.m.c., aviator, chicago, illinois, mia october 7, 1951, heartbreak
    ridge." "i just about fell out of my chair," o''meara says. "my blood just ran
    cold. i thought, `this can''t be.'' " within moments, another of barker''s web
    pages was materializing on o''meara''s computer, this one with delacy''s official
    marine corps photo. o''meara recognized it immediately. "i''ve seen pictures of
    this man on all the tv sets in all our houses." he printed out a bunch of pages
    from the web site, full of information barker had gathered on delacy, and he and
    his family pored over them on memorial day. "we were totally floored by all of
    this," o''meara says. since then, he and barker, who now lives in dallas, have
    stayed in contact by e-mail. like many americans, delacy''s relatives had no idea
    a korean war memorial was to be dedicated soon, and, until a couple of months
    ago, they had no way of imagining that they might have a particular reason for
    going. although several family members, including barbara heinrich; her husband,
    lee; their daughter, nancy; june o''meara; mark o''meara; and his wife, char,
    wanted to attend the memorial''s dedication, they won''t be able to. washington-area
    hotels have been booking up for this week for months, and the notice has been
    too short for the family to rearrange work and school schedules. still, art delacy''s
    family and hal barker will no doubt meet each other before too long. though he
    looks forward to giving them the prayer beads in person, barker, who will spend
    the week in washington, isn''t concerned that they won''t be at the dedication.
    he has had more than enough years to develop patience. "there''s plenty of time,"
    he says. "it''s a very old circle." illustration photos 3; caption: photo: second

    in response to "disappointed dad": hasn''t he heard about the new law in new york?
    a judge recently ruled that allowing men to remove their shirts in public while
    penalizing women for indecent exposure was discrimination. i''m glad that america
    has begun to follow the european code of dress for beaches, and to show a more
    enlightened view of the female breast. there is nothing inherently shameful or
    erotic about the female breast, although our constant attempts to cover them up
    makes it seem that way. it''s about time someone recognized that we have been
    forced to hide our bodies unnecessarily because men view the female breast as
    a sex object. i know many men who find a well-turned ankle or a shapely leg far
    sexier than a naked breast, and yet it is no longer considered indecent to expose
    our legs and feet in public. it should be no more shameful to expose female breasts
    than to expose faces or elbows. j.g. in philadelphia'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a 30-year-old woman who never married. for the last eight months, i have
    been seeing a 44-year-old divorced man with three children. according to rumors
    spread by his ex-wife, he physically abused her and the children. i think he is
    a good father, and his ex-wife probably drove him to violence. he admits he hit
    her a few times, but isn''t a batterer. he says she is crazy, but she is well-liked
    in the community. i have never met her in person, but i know she criticizes everything
    he does because i''ve heard them argue on the phone. the court gave her full custody
    and his visits with the kids are limited, but he always pays his child support
    on time and likes to buy them extra things. my friends are warning me to stay
    away from him. i care about this man. he is sweet and charming to me, and he says
    he is not the same man he was when he was married to that woman. i believe him,
    but i don''t know how to defend him, and i want my friends to like him. (my family
    doesn''t know about the rumors, and they think he is a good man.) don''t men only
    hit women who make them that mad? and sometimes isn''t the woman to blame? no

    i strongly disagree with your reply to the 13-year- old girl whose parents forbade
    her any contact with the boy she believes she "truly" loves. you agreed with the
    parents'' judgment and told her to honor their wishes. what that girl needs right
    now is supervision and guidance, not imprisonment. as a single father, i also
    believe she may not be ready to make a long-term commitment, but the tone of her
    letter, her history of good grades, and the fact that she was seeking advice instead
    of being outright rebellious did show signs of maturity and intelligence. why
    not allow the two to see each other under rules set down by the parents and mutually
    agreed upon? these could include that they only get together at home when there
    is an adult present, and if they go out, they do so only as part of a group. this
    would allow the parents to get to know the boy better, and the two to spend time
    together. who knows? it may turn out that the parents find the boy quite acceptable,
    or the girl may find she doesn''t "love" him after all. minnesota dad'

    i am a 40-year-old woman in love with a 54-year-old married man. (i''ll call him

    together for several years and became friends. after his divorce three years ago,
    he was having a hard time financially, so i invited him to move in with me and
    my adult son. over the course of the next two years, gerald helped more and more
    with the living expenses and took over the rent, cable tv, utility bills, etc.
    abby, we started out as friends, but eventually i fell very much in love with

    at work and wanted to marry her! she is pretty, talented and closer to his age.
    six months later they were married. my heart is broken. all i want is for gerald''s
    marriage to end and for him to come back to me. i still leave messages on his
    answering machine at work so he won''t forget about me. my friends tell me it''s
    a lost cause; that if he were ever going to fall in love with me, he would have

    your advice to "jill and jane" about sitting down with their husbands and explaining
    that they had neither the time nor energy to do all the work around the house
    was somewhat glib. granted, there are women out there who don''t speak up--they
    enjoy being martyrs--but you know what? there are men out there who still believe
    that they need not be responsible for anything except the power lawn mower. some
    men are just plain lazy, uncaring and selfish. i solved that problem with my husband
    of 30 years, who had never lifted a finger to help me. no amount of begging worked.
    i am a nurse, and after a particularly exhausting day and fighting with him at
    night because he wouldn''t help me, i turned to him and quietly said, "i did not
    sign on to be your mother or your maid. i am sick of you as a person. you no longer
    have my love or respect. i want a divorce. furthermore, you can leave right now--start
    packing!" he knew i meant it, so he packed up and left. it was a month before
    i heard from him again. he had gone to live with his sister, and after two weeks,
    she told him to get out, that he was a hog, and was not welcome to stay any longer!
    another month passed. he began calling and asking if we could talk. i said, "not
    if it''s going to degenerate into a shouting match." he promised it wouldn''t.
    he came over, and gone was the "attitude" and the swagger. i laid down the ground
    rules and told him i wouldn''t consider taking him back until we saw a marriage
    counselor and resolved some serious issues. a year later, we are back together,

    i read an article recently about the "hidden poor"--senior citizens whose pensions
    have been eroded by inflation. they own their own condos or homes, wear good jewelry
    from prosperous years, and never let on that the lunch at the senior citizens
    center was their only meal that day. several years ago, i found myself in similar
    circumstances. other widows lived in my condo complex, and we often rode the bus
    to the center together. one day, we reminisced about the food of our childhoods.
    we were a very diverse ethnic group--so we really enjoyed learning how our mothers
    had stretched a dollar during the depression years. someone mentioned "polenta";
    i said it sounded delicious and would love to have the recipe. she started to
    tell me how to make it, but since i was desperate for company, i said, "if i buy
    the ingredients, will you come to my place and show me how to make it?" she snapped
    up the invitation, and we invited two other ladies to join us. abby, it turned
    out to be so much fun, we started "the depression gourmet club." each member hosts
    a depression dish. we have a small plastic trophy that is passed around to the
    winner. our group has expanded. we learn about different cultures and have eaten
    foods we never dreamed existed--and we''ve made some good friends. this may be

    until they got settled. well, what should have taken a couple of weeks (a month

    no effort to get a place of their own. even worse, they have not offered any money

    their children around water. i am not the mother of a child, but i was a "mother"
    to a 5-week-old kitten. you are probably wondering why a teen who is not a parent
    is writing this letter. well, my tiny kitten drowned in our toilet. it broke my
    heart because i was the one who found her. all i can do is imagine what a mother
    would do if she found her infant or toddler in a pool, toilet, bucket of water--any
    of the things a child can drown in. on the same day my kitten drowned, an infant
    drowned in a fish pond. where were the infant''s parents? no one knows. they said
    he slipped out of the house. pools are the main cause for infant drowning cases.
    these pools usually have gates without automatic locks or high fences. there is
    a law here in arizona requiring a 6-foot fence around pools where there are children
    who cannot swim living in the home. these laws are being broken every day; consequently,
    children drown. abby, please print this to remind your readers of how dangerous
    pools can be. phoenix teenager'

    my 17-year-old son (i''ll call him bill) has a friend at school who confides in
    him. "meg" is 15, and has been sneaking out of her parents'' house in the middle
    of the night to have sex with several different older boys. her parents don''t
    have a clue about this. meg uses no birth control or protection for herself or
    her partners. i want to alert her parents, but bill has sworn me to secrecy. meg
    was recently tested for syphilis and pregnancy, and while waiting for the results,
    she continued to sneak out and have sex with different boys. (she said if she
    got pregnant, she wouldn''t know who the father is.) i can''t tell meg''s parents
    without getting my son in trouble with her for having told me. what should i do?

    my wife and i have brunch with a couple we are very fond of. we pay one week and

    is usually around $50. but their bar bill is between $30 and $40. i don''t think
    it''s fair that we should have to pay for their drinks, but when we suggested
    separate checks, they were insulted. they don''t seem to realize what the problem

    i appreciated the letter you printed about how people deal with tragedy, but one
    of the letters left me wincing. while i don''t mean to diminish the writer''s
    pain, i noticed that she referred to her imprisoned son as "my adopted son, fred."
    how sad that she still feels it necessary to make that distinction. many members
    of our extended family, as well as my husband and i, have "adopted" as well as
    "biological" children. if you were to ask me which ones were adopted, i would
    have to stop and think a minute. you would be amazed at some of the questions
    i have been asked by strangers. for example: "is she one of your natural children?"
    (none of our children is unnatural.) "have you met his mother?" (yes, i look at
    her in the mirror every day.) "couldn''t you have any children of your own?" (they
    are all our own!) "why did his mother give him away?" (how nosy and rude!) in
    our family, we view parenthood, adoption and marriages in much the same way--they
    are all lifetime, permanent commitments. also, all children (adopted or not) have
    questions about where they came from, and we respond to all the questions honestly.
    god had a number of interesting ways of bringing children into our family, and
    we accepted them all without question. perhaps some people who read this letter
    will stop and think before making one of those thoughtless comments. kristi wood,

    i was so moved, and felt such appreciation for your father''s day column, i would
    like to acknowledge what a valuable message it carried. you said: "a 21-gun salute
    to the divorced father who has never uttered an unkind word about the mother of
    his children (at least to the children) and who has always been johnny-on-the-spot
    with the support check." abby, those words brought tears to my eyes as i sat quietly
    reflecting on the seventh year i have celebrated father''s day without my children.
    it struck me as amazingly sad that in seven years of being there for my children--and
    always providing child support--i''ve never received a thank-you. my morale has
    been worn down over the years by the stereotyping of divorced fathers as "deadbeat
    dads"--a particularly cruel label. abby, if i never get a "thanks," i''ll survive.
    reading the public thanks in your column for a principle i''ve upheld not only
    for the sake of my children, but for the sake of fathers and children everywhere,
    is a powerful remedy for the sadness i have carried. for any recipient of support
    out there who has thought of saying "thanks," but never did--i''d bet it wouldn''t
    hurt. may i offer a sincere "you''re welcome" from a loving, supportive dad? thomas

    it''s also the "gang thing" was right on the money! shaved heads can and do send
    the wrong signals. it''s true that many gangs have adopted this look, and they
    really do resent non-members who copy them. i''ve known kids who''ve been attacked
    for "copying," or they''re mistaken for members of rival gangs. this applies to
    people of all races. i know people close to the oklahoma bombing tragedy, and
    i''ve had nightmares about timothy mcveigh''s buzzed image. this is a look that
    seems to stand for violence and war. (what''s the first thing they do to enlistees
    at boot camp? shave their heads!) parents, play it safe and say no. don''t invite
    trouble. even if you don''t live near gangs, you might have reason to visit an
    area at some time where they are present. shaved heads, buzz or brush cuts have
    a different meaning today than they did a generation ago. i know a lot of guys
    who think they look cool. to me they look like skinned rats. they look downright
    ugly. i''m also not fond of the "skater" cut that makes the guy look like he has
    a bowl on his head, nor do i like the baseball caps, half-shaved heads, little
    ponytails or goatees. i''m sure most kids do it to rebel, but i think they look
    geeky. i hope these trends pass, or i may never date. i know looks shouldn''t
    matter that much--it''s what''s on the inside that counts--but i can''t help it.
    those styles may look cool to some people, but they turn me off. maybe it''s because
    i''ve had negative experiences with those guys. my parents say i have a lot of
    time to worry about dating, anyway. i''ll wait as long as it takes. not about

    your answer to the arizona lady who inquired how she should have handled the situation
    of uninvited relatives who elected to take their leftovers home was dismaying.
    why? because your answer ignored the fundamental breach of etiquette, and focused
    on a technicality related to ordered-in food. the breach of etiquette had three
    components: first, the visitors arrived unexpectedly; second, the visitors ignored
    another obvious courtesy they should have shown their hostess--not to stay so
    long that it becomes necessary to invite them for dinner; and third, because the
    dinner was ordered in, surely the courteous action would have been to pay part
    of the bill. instead, the hostess indicated that she paid for the entire order.
    in my mind, your response implies that the actions on the part of the guests were
    acceptable. your response would have been more appropriate had you taken the opportunity
    to educate your readers about the proper behavior of guests. it seems to me that
    the rules for that situation are quite clear: if you drop in unannounced, make
    it a short visit, and don''t place your host or hostess in the position of having
    to provide lunch or dinner for an unexpected guest. if the situation favors staying
    longer, offer to share the cost of the added expense your visit imposes. if the
    host or hostess declines, that''s one thing, but at least the offer should be
    made. katherine walker, rockport, mass.'

    man of 25. we''ve been married a little over a year, and i have a problem i can''t
    ask anyone else about. it has to do with sex. mike has a big appetite for sex,
    but i am not complaining. it''s his timing that bothers me. he always wants to
    make love on sunday morning before mass. abby, i know that love within marriage
    is not a sin, but for some silly reason i just hate to go to mass right after
    having had sex. lately i have been putting my husband off. but i feel guilty about
    that. do you think i should postpone the lovemaking until after mass? or should
    i keep telling myself i have no reason to feel guilty about it, and just try to
    get over that feeling? what''s wrong with me? maggie in manhattan'

    my husband and i are friendly with another couple whom we do not see very often
    because of the distance between us. we have dinner at one home or the other about
    twice a year. tonight, they were our guests. they arrived promptly at 6:30 p.m.
    and we had drinks on the patio. at 7 p.m., my husband went inside and turned on
    the tv to catch the beginning of a football game. after 15 minutes, he rejoined
    us, "freshened" the drinks, then went back inside to watch the game. i tried several
    times, without success, to root him out. at 7:30, my husband emerged, put the
    steaks on the grill, then he ran inside again to watch the game, returning in
    time to turn the steaks. he rushed through dinner and then returned to the game
    again. i made conversation with the guests until the game was over. then my football
    fan joined us for a spirited 20 minutes of conversation after which our guests
    departed, saying they had a long drive home. needless to say, i am terribly upset
    and wonder if we will ever see these lovely people again. what should i have done?
    and how can i keep this from happening again? football widow'

    our very pretty and bright 18-year-old daughter (i''ll call her nancy) graduated
    from high school last may. she decided to stay home and work for a year before
    going to college. nancy met a 29-year-old professional man about six months ago
    and they started dating. (i''ll call him paul.) they never actually went steady,
    but paul gave her a big rush. well, for christmas, paul surprised nancy with a
    beautiful one-carat diamond ring. it came as a big shock to nancy because she
    wasn''t considering marriage with paul. in fact, she told me she hated to kiss
    him because he had a bad case of halitosis! when nancy saw the ring, she told
    paul she didn''t think she should accept it, but he started to cry, so she kept
    it because she didn''t want to hurt his feelings. nancy is sure she doesn''t want
    to be engaged, but every time she tries to return the ring, paul cries, and talks
    her into keeping it. nancy is very tenderhearted and paul is very persuasive,
    so do you think it would be all right if nancy''s father returned the ring to
    paul? post-christmas dilemma'

    i must admit i have been in jail three or four times, but not because of any real
    wrongdoing. "my health is not too good, though i still accomplish a great deal.
    the churches i have preached in have been small, though located in several large
    cities. "i''ve not gotten along well with religious leaders in the towns where
    i have preached. in fact, some have threatened me, and even attacked me physically.
    i am not too good at keeping records. i have been known to forget whom i have
    baptized. "however, if you can use me, i promise to do my best for you." the board
    member turned to the committee and said, "well, what do you think? shall we call
    him?" the good church folks were appalled! consider a sickly, trouble-making,
    absent-minded ex-jailbird? was the board member crazy? who signed the application?
    who had such colossal nerve? the board member eyed them all keenly before he replied,
    "it''s signed, `the apostle paul.'' "'

    a standing ovation to you for your answer to the impotent 70-year-old widower,

    so than admitting to having diabetes, arthritis, asthma, heart trouble or a host

    to memorize a few phrases for openers. for example: "i am very much attracted

    worked for me. now i have a girlfriend, and we are crazy about each other. abby,

    i feel that being in someone''s wedding is an honor. unfortunately, the cost is
    staggering. a tuxedo rental costs between $80 and $100, bridesmaids'' gowns average
    $180 to $220, and flower girls'' dresses average between $75 and $100. if a married
    couple are both in the bridal party, they will spend between $260 and $320 for
    their clothing for just one day! there are also other events that go with being
    in the wedding party. a shower gift costs around $20, and a ticket to the stag
    party costs around $20. this brings the cost up to $300 to $360. now my question:
    is it written in any etiquette books that people in the wedding party need not
    buy a wedding gift? after all, how much should a friend or relative''s wedding

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    what are your feelings regarding the use of flash photography by professional
    photographers during a church ceremony? last week, i encountered a woman minister
    who flatly refused to permit flash photos in her church. she insisted that it
    would disrupt the service. abby, i fully understand that a wedding should not
    become a circus because of guests getting up and taking pictures; however, i see
    no harm in one professional photographer capturing those priceless moments on
    film. flash photographs are necessary to accomplish this. the timing is thrown
    off for everyone, especially the caterers, if they have to wait for the wedding
    pictures to be taken after the ceremony. it becomes a nightmare to keep the food
    hot without it drying out. we are looking at 20 to 30 minutes even when things
    go smoothly. the guests grow impatient and anxious to get to the reception to
    eat and socialize. young children are difficult to work with when trying to re-create
    the wedding. the most important factor is the loss of genuine emotions, which
    can''t be re-created--especially in an empty church. i don''t think it''s asking
    too much to allow flash photos of the most memorable day of the couple''s lives.
    my advice to couples planning a formal church wedding: ask if flash photos will
    be permitted during the ceremony. if they are not, either find another church,
    or elope. the clergyperson should have enough generosity of spirit to want to
    make your wedding day one to cherish forever. what better way than photos in your
    wedding album to show your children and grandchildren? "flash" in new hampshire'

    hang out with debbie nigro for two morning hours at her 7-eleven book signing
    and this is what you-and anyone else within earshot-learn: her tan comes from
    a bottle. she weighed 212 before giving birth to her daughter. she crams more
    words into a minute than webster does in a quartet of dictionary pages. she has
    a gift for making everyday life funny. people open up to her. like the woman named
    lenice, who admits, "there''s laundry lying on my bed where i fell asleep last
    night." "that''s ok," debbie counters. "the laundry police aren''t going to come
    and get you." wait. back up a minute. a 7 a.m. book signing? at 7-eleven? it''s
    a joke, right? nope. at dawn''s early light it may seem like a joke. by 9 a.m.,
    it seems perfectly natural. the reason: debbie nigro, single mother of a 7-year-old,
    is "the working mom on the run." that''s the story of her life as well as the
    name of her syndicated radio show. now it''s part of the title of her new book:
    "the working mom on the run manual (a k a what the heck happened to my life?)"
    (master media, $9.95). what better place to find harried and hurried men and women
    than 7-eleven, one of her sponsors? during her recent dallas visit, she finds
    plenty of on-the-run parents. she gives-yes, gives-away 150 books and a dozen
    or so exercise videos, signing each with a personal message. she even runs a book
    out to someone in the parking lot who is in too big a hurry to wait in line. when
    debbie runs out of freebies, she takes down 20 or so names and addresses, promising
    to send copies. "this is definitely a book for people who have no time to read
    a book," says debbie, single mom of 7-year-old alexis. "i had no time to write
    the darned thing." the paperback combines self-deprecating anecdotes, fun facts
    and common-sense tips. in the book, debbie lists her favorite hair products and
    lipstick. she gives advice for finding a lawyer, fixing a broken heel, starting
    a business, curbing morning sickness and keeping cauliflower odors from the kitchen.
    she''s part erma bombeck, part heloise, part dear abby, part avon lady (the company
    was her first backer and she freely promotes their products). she talks so fast
    that her business partner/fiance jeff troncone gives her "speeding tickets" when
    her sentences become one long, breathless word on her radio show. for each, she
    donates $50 to the american red cross. at her 7-eleven book signing, nary a moment
    passes without a word from debbie. to wini campbell-whose excitement at being
    here at such an early hour borders on overwhelming-debbie says, "you''re a little
    perky this morning. what''s up?" she also gives unsolicited, yet appreciated,
    advice. to daisy clavijo, a single mother of two, she suggests finding other moms
    in the same boat and switching off child-care duties. that way, the adults can
    take turns getting out and the children can play together. one woman, surrounded
    by three children and holding her newborn fourth, holds out a book for debbie
    to sign. "wow," debbie says. "what beautiful children. do you have help with them?"
    "no," the woman says and looks as if she might cry. "i have no friends and my
    family''s not here." "listen to me," debbie says. "you don''t think there are
    other women like you? tell your little girl''s teacher you''re looking to meet
    other moms in the class. have them over for a tea party with their daughters.
    you''ve gotta do something to make some headway. you look a little sad." in the
    woman''s book, debbie writes: "you''re beautiful, and your own wonderful life
    is just around the corner." "it''s important to connect with someone who gets
    it," debbie says while switching to a pen that works. "i''m a spokesperson for
    what''s been taken for granted for so long, and people appreciate that." that''s
    why she says she believes her radio show is so popular. and why, during one three-hour
    show last month, she received some 20,000 calls. the month before, she had a 9,000-call
    day. she covers issues most everyone deals with - what she calls the "blender-brain
    syndrome." that means storing a million things in your head: what''s for dinner?
    where are the car keys? how can i get one kid to the dentist and one to soccer
    practice at the same time? did i write a thank-you note to my mother for my birthday
    present? "the only thing i''m an expert on is this life," debbie says. "i call
    myself the living cartoon. i reach out to experts to advise me. i consider myself,
    my book and the radio show a resource." illustration photo; caption: photo: author-radio

    i''ve read your column for years, but was never moved to write to you until now.
    "ticked off in texas" wrote that she was furious about having to share her husband
    with his ex-wife. that letter brought back memories for me. my husband has an
    ex-wife with whom he refused to have any contact. he wouldn''t even speak to her.
    this behavior unfortunately extended to his daughter as well, even though he paid
    child support. there were no phone calls to his daughter, no letters, no visits,
    no contact at all--because to have done so would have put him in the position
    of running into his ex-wife, which was the last thing he wanted to do! abby, this
    meant the responsibility of developing a relationship with my husband''s daughter
    fell on me. i was the one who initiated all contact, telephoned, etc.--and ultimately
    opened the way for my husband to get to know his own daughter. i would have dearly
    loved to have found myself in the situation that "ticked off in texas" complained
    about. the opportunity to keep a relationship going with his child, without the
    interference of an angry and bitter ex-spouse (which frequently happens in a divorce),
    is a blessing and a joy, and makes for a better relationship for the second marriage
    as well. which would "ticked off" prefer? a relationship where the first wife
    proceeds to tear down her husband and herself (a situation where no one wins)?
    or is she willing to have her husband remain friends with the mother of his children,
    allowing him to develop the father/child relationship that is so important to
    young people, and also gives her the opportunity to know what may turn out to
    be an exciting young person? in this scenario, there are no losers. winner in

    my father passed away two years ago. mother has been living in florida and has
    had a new boyfriend for about five months. three weeks ago, mom returned to illinois
    for her usual summer visit and brought her boyfriend, "ernie," with her. she usually
    stays with one of us kids (there are six of us), and this year was my turn to
    be hostess. after they were here a couple of hours, it was time to retire. my
    two sons (ages 4 and 7) were already in bed. as mom and ernie brought their luggage
    in, i prepared the two available bedrooms. (one was upstairs and the other was
    in the basement.) i told them they could decide where they each wanted to sleep.
    mother threw a fit that she and ernie couldn''t sleep together! (they don''t live
    together in florida.) i told her that for the sake of the kids, i didn''t think
    it was a good idea. my oldest son knows you are supposed to be married when you
    are sleeping with someone. dad would never stay at the home of an unmarried couple
    because he felt it was morally wrong. this is the way i was raised. my sister
    called just then, and while i was on the phone, mom and ernie got their things
    together and left. mom never even said goodbye. she called my sister and said
    their "plans had changed" and not to expect her. she called no one else. she told
    my sister i treated her unfairly. (she would have been treated the same way at
    my sister''s, because her children are 13, 11 and 2.) abby, did i treat my mother
    unfairly? since it is my home, shouldn''t she have respected my wishes? i still
    haven''t heard from mom. sign me ... confused in illinois'

    i am 30 and have been married one year. my parents live 1,000 miles away. when
    i was single, i would visit my folks for two weeks at christmas and three to six
    weeks in the summer. but now that i''m married, i''m lucky to get home for one
    week. here''s my problem: my older brother has two little girls, ages 3 1/2 and
    1 1/2. when i go home to stay with my parents, he comes over and brings his children,
    and my parents practically ignore me. because i visit them for only a short time,
    i am really hurt by their lack of attention. i don''t want to have to compete
    with those kids. my last visit was a disaster because of this, so i cut it short
    and left two days early. there i was with my new husband, hoping to have our whole
    family together at church. (the church is very important to me; i was baptized
    there and was a member until i was 26.) what did mother do? she stayed home to
    take care of the girls! ever since my marriage i have felt a gap between us. i

    i disagree with your response to the mother of the rejected "two-toned" bridesmaid.
    what happened to freedom and the right to express yourself? if a bride chooses
    a bridesmaid, she chooses all the qualities of that individual, not just the ones
    the bride wants or the ones the bride''s mother wants. you said that the attention
    should be focused on the bride. if the bride can''t capture the attention at her
    own wedding, i don''t think a bridesmaid with a different hairstyle should be
    responsible! i personally think bridesmaids and groomsmen and everyone involved
    in the wedding are there to assist in the grand celebration, not be dressed up
    like dolls! and certainly they should not be thrown out of a celebration just
    because of the way they look. i think the bride''s mother acted very immaturely
    and is just as responsible for apologizing for her behavior. on a personal note,
    i would say (believe it or not), "way to go!" to anyone in my wedding party who
    would choose to express herself (or himself) in a unique way. my friends always
    have freedom in every way--even on my wedding day. laura boedeker, los angeles'

    after reading about the tragic death of a baby who was mauled by a pet dog, i
    feel compelled to ask you to tell your readers how to deal with similar situations.
    years ago, i read that the best way to force a dog to release its victim is to
    grab the dog''s hind legs and lift them quickly off the ground. i think it''s
    important that this method be publicized, as it is much more humane than hitting
    the dog over the head, which is the way people who don''t know better handle it.
    could you please find out if this method is endorsed by dog handlers? sad in california'

    i''ve been married to "bruce" for a number of years. this is the second marriage
    for both of us, and we try not to bring up things from our past. yesterday, i
    bumped into "norm," who had been my best friend when i was married to my ex. we
    were never romantically involved, but norm was the best friend i ever had--always
    there when i needed him. we lost track of each other and i was overjoyed to have
    found him again. bruce got very upset when i told him i''d like him to meet norm.
    he said he doesn''t bring up friends from his past, and refused to even meet norm

    recently i''ve seen several references to the problem of people with poor hearing
    obtaining driver''s licenses. i''ve been hoping to see a letter from one of your
    deaf or hard-of-hearing readers explaining that poor hearing is not an issue when
    it comes to driving. i am an interpreter for the deaf, and one of the most commonly
    asked questions is, "can deaf people drive?" abby, the ability to drive has absolutely
    nothing to do with hearing. in fact, insurance companies report that deaf drivers
    have fewer accidents than hearing drivers! deaf people rely on their vision much
    more than hearing people, thus they are much more attuned to what''s happening
    on the road. emergency vehicles have huge revolving bubble lights, which make
    them visible to people who do not hear them coming. if hearing were really that
    important to drivers, companies that manufacture car stereos would have to do
    something about the volume of those stereos. believe me, people driving around
    with their stereos blasting are a much greater hazard on the road than the deaf
    or hard-of-hearing. diana walsh o''toole, yorktown, va.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i''m writing in response to "gail h. in georgia," the woman who is now paying
    the price for being a smoker. she now breathes with the help of a respirator.
    when i read her sad letter, i cried. my mother also tried to quit smoking. she
    tried hypnosis three times at $60 a pop. her resolve lasted only 45 minutes after
    each session. for as long as i can remember, my two brothers and i pleaded with
    mom to quit--not only for her health but ours as well. my brother, brett, had
    constant earaches, and i had constant throat problems because of her smoking.
    i was afraid i would lose not only my mother, but my best friend. although i hounded
    her about her smoking for years, i failed. she was diagnosed with lung cancer
    on sept. 7, 1993. after two weeks of testing, cancer was found all through her
    body. even though she was on oxygen at the hospital and could barely breathe without
    it, she was sent home with only "pump" treatments. as soon as she finished her
    treatments, she''d ask someone to light a cigarette for her. she was furious with
    me because i refused. she could no longer sit up in a chair without support, yet
    i continued to argue with her about smoking. everyone said, "give it up, tara.
    let her do what she wants--let her be happy." they say that she was dying. how
    could she be dying? she was only 49 years old. i was her youngest--her 16-year-old
    daughter. besides, the doctor told us she had six months to two years--not 37
    days! she stopped smoking when she died of cancer on oct. 11, 1993. two years
    ago, i was crying out to my mother and to god! now i''m crying out to every smoker.
    mother started smoking when she was 16, but she never intended to smoke her entire
    life. many teens have the same idea. they think they''ll smoke "for now"--then
    quit without a problem. my mother''s death is proof that it''s not that easy.
    if teen smokers could have seen what my mother went through, they wouldn''t even
    start. i think mother''s history should be included in the health education classes
    offered to students. also, in order to pass the class, students should have to
    spend at least one week with a dying cancer patient and his or her family. it''s
    a living hell. once they saw that smoking eventually makes one incapable of moving,
    breathing and living, they would feel the heartbreak that i felt. another thing
    i don''t understand is my father. he was there every day, watching mother die.
    he has now remarried--and would you believe to a smoker! she''s not allowed to
    smoke in our house, so she smokes outdoors. i may not be breathing her toxic fumes,
    but my father is. i thought he''d have known better after seeing one wife die
    from cancer. dad has a bad heart condition, and breathing in smoke is bad for
    him. i love dad with all my heart, and can''t bear the thought of losing him--especially
    to secondhand smoke. abby, your column reaches millions. i hope my letter will
    make a difference. if it prevents just one person from smoking, it will be well
    worth it. tara esther libbens'

    my father was killed in vietnam in 1974. i was only 4 years old and don''t remember

    they were childhood sweethearts, and after he died, she never remarried. recently
    i lost my dear mother. as i was putting away her things, i found this poem, written
    in her hand, among a box of keepsakes: remember the day i borrowed your brand-new
    car, and i dented it? i thought you''d kill me, but you didn''t. and remember
    the time i dragged you to the beach, and you said it would rain, and it did? i
    thought you''d say, "i told you so," but you didn''t. do you remember the time
    i flirted with all the guys to make you jealous? and you were? i thought you''d
    leave me, but you didn''t. do you remember the time i spilled strawberry pie all
    over the rug in your new car? i thought you''d hit me, but you didn''t. and remember
    the time i forgot to tell you the dance was formal, and you showed up in jeans?
    i thought you''d drop me, but you didn''t. yes, there were lots of things you
    didn''t do, but you put up with me, and you loved me, and you protected me. there
    were lots of things i wanted to make up to you when you returned from vietnam,
    but you didn''t. abby, my mom never wrote anything in her life, but this piece
    describes my parents so perfectly i''m wondering how it could have come from anyone
    else. can you help me? have you ever seen it before, and do you know if there
    is an author? i will treasure it no matter what. fascinated in fallbrook'

    how blind we mortals be! "j.g. in philadelphia" complained that women have been
    forced to hide their bodies because men view female breasts as sex objects. she
    claimed that there is nothing inherently erotic about the female breast, but "our
    constant attempts to cover them makes it seem that way," and there is no basis
    for it in psychobiology. doesn''t she realize that throughout the animal kingdom,
    female breasts enlarge only to signal readiness for sex or to feed newborns? the
    single exception to this is humans--and because human females and babies are dependent
    for so long, the male must be "persuaded" to hang around. the strategic instruments
    of persuasion are perpetually enlarged breasts that dupe the poor hormone-driven,
    visually addicted human male into unconsciously believing the female is always
    ready for sex. of course, what works for "evolution" doesn''t always conform to
    reality. but if she''s got the equipment, it certainly seems that way. clark t.

    the issue of what to do when a man comes to dinner wearing a cap--in this case,
    i believe, it was a baseball cap--prompted me to write. i am a waiter in a first-class
    restaurant, and the management advised us to never ask a patron to remove his
    hat--never! management learned that lesson the hard way. a new waiter asked a
    gentleman diner to kindly remove his cap. the man refused, so the captain went
    to the table and politely repeated the request. he was told that the gentleman
    preferred to keep his cap on because he was having chemotherapy treatments for

    i must disagree with your flip answer to "ticked off in texas." it is clear that

    wife where there are children from a prior marriage. i agree, it is very important
    for the divorced parents to be able to discuss matters pertaining to their child
    (or children), but that is as far as it should go. buying items from the drug
    (or grocery) store for his former wife should not be his responsibility. if this
    couple is such good friends, why did they get divorced in the first place? he
    has remarried, and his main responsibility is to his present wife. for you to

    when someone dies and the family requests that in lieu of sending flowers a donation

    every year when our son was small, we traveled to be with our families at christmas.
    making travel arrangements, transporting gifts back and forth, etc., were real
    hassles. each year became more stressful than the last. because my husband, "jeff,"
    is an airline pilot, everyone assumes that we can jump on a plane anytime we want,
    but that''s not the case. and it has never failed that if we fly, the gifts we
    receive are so bulky it''s impossible to carry them back with us. last year, we
    visited four homes on christmas day, and when it was over, we couldn''t help feeling
    tired and irritable. not surprisingly, we decided to celebrate christmas at home
    this year. our problem: our families still expect us to come and pick up our gifts.
    they have suggested that if jeff has a trip to or near their area, he can come
    by their homes and pick them up. this is very inconvenient for him. i say that
    if you plan to buy gifts for people who live far away, you should also plan to

    their responsibility to raise their offspring in person? the schools should be
    filled with adults to help in every area. children of all ages need constant loving

    well, i finally made up my mind to stick to an old diet my physician had given
    me about 10 years ago. believe it or not, i lost 100 pounds in eight months. as
    a result, my social life has picked up terrifically. (now women call me!) however,
    every time i go out with a woman, i can''t help thinking, "where was this woman
    when i was alone and fat?" then i begin thinking of ways to reject her, just as
    i had been rejected so many times when i was fat. i realize that my attitude is
    petty and unrealistic, but i keep thinking back to my fat and lonely days and
    the rejection i had suffered for years. what is wrong with me, abby? abnormal

    i agree with barbara mcwilliams somervill that no person, whether man or woman,
    should expect to be thanked for paying child support. i would like to point out,
    however, that noncustodial parents also face sacrifices: they often work two jobs
    or overtime hours so they can afford the child support; their social life and
    standard of living become limited because of the time and money spent on the children;
    and they miss the day-to-day joy of watching their children grow up. there are
    good and bad parents on both sides of the gender fence. who cares if you don''t
    feel that you are being thanked enough by your former spouse? i am not asking
    anyone for thanks. just knowing my son loves me as much as i love him is all the
    thanks i will ever need as a parent. the point is supposed to be that as a parent,
    you are there for your children any way you can be; you do the best you can for
    them; and you help them grow into decent, well-mannered adults who can one day
    be good parents themselves. elliott lofton, camp lejeune, n.c.'

    this is for "flash in new hampshire," who was all bent out of shape because a

    no sacred religious ceremony should be disrupted by flash photos--they are an
    intrusion upon the dignity of the occasion. as for understanding the need to prevent
    guests from doing this, a professional photographer must take many shots, thus
    intruding on the ceremony so that one or two memorable moments may be captured.
    we are in the personal intrusion/information age when photographers and journalists
    tend to become part of the ceremony, thus detracting from the intimacy of the
    occasion. if "flash" thinks so little of the religious beliefs of the couple,
    perhaps a justice of the peace would have been a more appropriate option. your
    suggestion to "shop around" for another church or elope shows a disturbing lack
    of understanding of the deep meaning of a religious ceremony. what will be next?
    capturing the last moments of a person''s life on film? or, heaven forbid, the

    may i comment on the letter from the woman who wrote to say that she and her husband

    months. as incredible as this must seem to someone born and bred in iowa, where
    people sometimes stay on one farm for three or four generations, moving is more
    common among city-dwellers than one would imagine. here are the advantages: 1.
    no housecleaning -- after five months, when the rug needs vacuuming and the toilet
    needs scrubbing, just move to a fresh, clean apartment. 2. less time to accumulate
    junk, and nonessentials get discarded. 3. bill collectors tire of tracking you
    down and give up. 4. junk mail doesn''t fill your mailbox; you''re long gone before

    i''m very close to my parents. both are in good health, but they live 350 miles
    away. since i can visit them only a couple of times a year, i call them almost
    daily. if i ever meet a man who thinks i shouldn''t be so close to my parents,
    i would tell him where to go. i would never jeopardize my relationship with my
    parents to compensate for someone''s low self-esteem. perhaps "irritated in ohio"
    should work on her self-esteem issue and stop feeling threatened when her husband
    calls his parents. barbara carroll, springfield, ore.'

    our grandson, "ricky," is 2 1/2 years old. over the last year, i have watched
    him become quite a "brat" when he is with his mom and dad. ricky is wonderful
    when he''s alone with me, but when his mom (our daughter) and i are with him and
    she corrects him, he hits her! she then corrects that (sometimes) by talking to
    him, or at best, making him stand in the corner. in the time it takes her to turn
    around, he''s out of the corner and crying, so she makes him say he''s sorry.
    (whoopee!) last weekend, i baby-sat ricky. he was great until his mother got home.
    then he did something she had told him not to do, so he turned around and hit
    me, and abby, i slapped him right back--on the shoulder. it wasn''t a hard slap,
    but it was firm. the situation then turned very cold because i had slapped ricky
    instead of having a "discussion" with him, or his mother. my husband told me that
    my daughter and her husband do not want anyone to touch their child, and it wasn''t
    my place to punish ricky. we had quite a disagreement over it. i had never touched
    my grandson before, but i refused to put up with this child hitting me. i have
    not had the opportunity to be around ricky again to know if my actions had any
    effect on him. it is embarrassing when we go out in public, or with the rest of
    the family, and ricky hits his mom and dad in the face and they do nothing! what
    do you think, abby? out in the cold in phoenix'

    four years ago, my 100-percent jewish daughter (now 29) married a religious catholic
    her age. we are not religious, but we observe all the jewish holidays. recently,
    our daughter and her husband started adoption proceedings for a little girl from
    another country. she''ll be 15 months old when they get her. my daughter informed
    us that she is attending classes on both the old and new testaments--in the church
    rectory. she says she would like some education in order to be able to answer
    questions concerning religion. i asked why she didn''t go to a synagogue to learn
    jewish history. no reply. i asked, only half-seriously, "you aren''t considering
    converting, are you?" her reply, "i don''t know yet. i might." abby, it was like
    i was struck by lightning. she said she would still celebrate the jewish holidays
    with us, and nothing would change. "then why convert?" i asked. "why not raise
    the child in both faiths and let her decide when she gets older?" what will her
    answer be when her daughter asks, "why are we going to grandma''s for passover
    if we''re not jewish?" should my daughter say, "i used to be jewish"? the next

    last summer i underwent surgery to fuse two of the vertebrae in my neck, and i
    had to wear a hard cervical collar for six weeks. for the first time in my life,
    i saw the world through the eyes of someone with a disability. most people were
    wonderful, but some were insensitive boors. conversations with the latter usually
    went something like this: "oh, lynn, what happened to you?" "i underwent some
    sur--" "i know, i had surgery myself about 10 years ago. what i went through,
    you wouldn''t believe!" these people would then engage in long harangues about
    their own health problems. if i ventured, "well, that is not what i had. i had.
    . .," they would interrupt with, "i know, my daughter had that, too. . ." then
    began a lengthy discourse regarding their children''s medical conditions. most

  body: 'dear readers: well, it seems as though we just finished polishing off the
    thanksgiving leftovers, and it''s time to start shopping for christmas and hanukkah
    gifts again. if you plan on sending holiday gifts, let me tell you what not to
    give aunt bessie or grandpa, who doesn''t get around much anymore. forget the
    cologne, aftershave and dusting powder. chances are, they have several unopened
    boxes gathering dust on their closet shelves. grandpa doesn''t need another paisley
    necktie, and grandma doesn''t want any more bracelets, brooches or earrings. with
    the price of groceries going through the roof, older people who live alone on
    fixed incomes would appreciate a basket of practical goodies. how about small
    tins of tuna, chicken and ham? also, crackers, instant coffee, tea, soup mixes
    and cookies. people who live in confined quarters do not need more "things," so
    don''t send music boxes or bric-a-brac. and don''t send articles of clothing unless
    you''re sure the size is right. leisure (or "warmup") suits are comfy and easy
    to launder. older folks love them. some truly useful gifts: an assortment of postcards,
    some lined stationery with envelopes and a generous supply of postage stamps.
    and enclose some felt-tip pens. another suggestion: a variety of greeting cards
    for all occasions. they might want to send someone a nice birthday, anniversary
    or graduation card. don''t forget get-well cards, condolence cards and "congratulations
    on the new baby" cards. should you be tempted to recycle a lovely but useless
    gift still in its original box, make sure the card to you is not still in the
    box. never give a pet to anyone unless you are absolutely certain that person
    wants a pet and is able to care for it properly. and if you want to make a hit
    with someone who has a pet, send a little holiday gift (a tin of dog or cat food)
    along with a gift for its master. don''t give wine or liquor to people unless
    you are sure they imbibe. a thoughtful idea: a gift subscription for a magazine
    or a newspaper you know they will enjoy. candy, nuts and fruitcake make beautiful
    gifts for people who aren''t counting their calories; but have a little compassion
    for those who are, and lead them not into temptation. also bear in mind that some
    older folks have difficulty chewing nuts and caramels. another good idea for those
    living alone on a fixed income: a gift certificate for some kind of service such
    as window washing, carpet cleaning, taxi rides, barber shop, beauty parlor, or
    dinner or lunch at their favorite place. and (don''t laugh) a gift certificate
    entitling them to a trip to the podiatrist. because medication is no small item
    these days, a gift certificate from the neighborhood pharmacy would be very much
    appreciated. trust me. holidays can be depressing for people who are alone--loneliness
    is the ultimate poverty. so if you know someone who could use an outing, give
    him or her the best gift of all: an invitation to have a meal with you and your
    family. if you "ain''t" givin'', you''re not livin''. love to you and yours, abby'

    i''m a divorced woman in my 40s with one young child. my ex-husband is usually
    unemployed and has never stayed at one job long enough for me to collect any money
    from him, so i receive no support whatsoever. i have no family who can help me
    out. my problem: i make enough money to pay the rent, utilities and insurance,
    and to buy groceries and gas, but after that there is nothing left over. i have
    no savings and drive an old car that''s on its last legs. our entertainment is
    heavily curtailed by this lack of extra money. i shop at thrift stores, watch
    my grocery bill and take my child to budget movies when i can afford it. i don''t
    date because i''m always flat broke, and these days you can''t assume that your
    date will pay. even if they do pay, there''s the cost of a sitter, which i cannot
    afford. i make it a point not to meet men so i don''t have to face this problem.
    if i work two jobs, i have to worry about a sitter for my daughter. i have taken
    on additional office jobs when available and i have worked on weekends, but this
    hasn''t been steady or guaranteed income. i''ve been looking for a job that pays
    more, but the competition is horrendous. my question: how do other single mothers
    do it? how do they offer their children exposure to the better things in life?
    even "free" activities have costs involved--gas to get there, soft drinks, etc.
    my daughter and i are just "existing"--not living. it angers me to have to tell
    her she can''t have music or dance lessons. it''s also very hard because all of
    my friends are married, and they have plenty of money to do as they please. they
    don''t ask me to do much because they know i''m unable to. i''m so sick of saying,
    "i''d love to--but i can''t afford it." after a while, they stop asking. no money''s

    you don''t get everything done by dec. 25, so what? you have 12 days at least
    to exchange gifts, see relatives, do charity work, have dinners, take walks on

    i am a serviceman stationed in georgia. three years ago, my wife of 13 years and
    i were having marital problems. without letting me know, she moved out of the
    house and went back to california, taking our 3-year-old son ("jordan") with her.
    we recently divorced, and i was granted christmas and summer visitation with jordan,
    who is now 6 years old. last summer, while jordan was visiting me, i remarried
    and included him in the wedding as the ring-bearer. my "ex" said if she had known
    i had this in mind, she never would have allowed jordan to come. (actually, that''s
    why i never told her.) abby, should i have told her and risked not getting my

    over the years, i have noticed a great many letters about weddings in your column.
    i have attended dozens of weddings and was maid of honor for each of my older
    sisters. my parents set aside a generous sum of money for each of my sisters''
    weddings. in both cases, the pre-wedding months were a trying time for my mother,
    baffling for my father and just plain unpleasant for everyone else in the house.
    it rained on the garden wedding, and it was hot at the indoor wedding. now it''s
    my turn. when i announced i was getting married, mom paled and dad groaned and
    said, "i''ll give you an extra $500 to elope." this was music to my ears because
    i had already decided i didn''t want the muss, fuss and expense of a fancy wedding.
    we plan to be married by a justice of the peace and take a three-week bicycle
    trip for our honeymoon. we''re thrilled with the extra money and my parents are
    relieved. can you believe my sisters think we are being hateful about the whole
    thing? my middle sister said, "i didn''t get any money," and my oldest sister
    thinks it is dishonorable to marry without an elaborate ceremony. my fiance, my
    dad and i laugh off their comments, but my mom is hurt. abby, what do you think?

    my husband and i have been married for nine years, and i have always had a good
    relationship with my mother-in-law, "ruth." we have 2-year-old twin boys, and
    my husband''s sister has a little girl, 4. ruth is a loving grandmother who''d
    never do anything intentional to harm her grandchildren. the problem is that she
    has no common sense and is lacking in basic safety knowledge. when the twins were
    barely 3 months old, ruth and i were shopping at a mall, and i asked her to watch
    them while i searched for something a couple of aisles away. when i returned,
    the babies were sleeping in their stroller unattended, and ruth was nowhere in
    sight. we have recently moved much closer to my in-laws, and now the issue of
    baby-sitting comes up often. abby, ruth and her husband take many medications,
    none of which are locked up or even have safety caps; she leaves pot handles pointing
    out on the stove, knives on the edge of the counter, and cabinets at child-level
    crammed with poisonous household cleaners. when i purchased electrical outlet
    safety caps and cabinet latches for their home, ruth was very offended. my husband,
    my sister-in-law and i have voiced our concerns about safety, but ruth reminds
    us that she raised two children quite safely without the aid of "fancy gadgets."

    baby-sitting she loves to do. what should i do? s.o.s. (sleepless over safety)'

    i get around fairly well with the use of a walker. recently, my brother and his

    the reception was held in the basement room of the church. after struggling to
    get down the stairs with my walker, i made my way to a table at which they were
    all seated. when i started to sit down, my brother and his wife said, "our family
    wants to sit together. why don''t you sit a couple of tables or so back?" i did
    as they asked; then one of their daughters came over and looked me up and down
    as if to say, "we''d like to sit there." it made me so uncomfortable that i immediately
    got up and said i''d go to a table on the far side of the room. luckily, there
    was another lady, also alone, whom i knew; so i sat with her. abby, several of
    their other children passed back and forth by me many times and didn''t even acknowledge

    at least three times a week, i get comments of some sort on the way we are raising
    our daughter. i disagree with many of the techniques they used when they were
    raising children. what seems like advice or ideas to them seems like criticism
    to me. my mother especially is always saying that i should be doing this or that.
    both mom and my mother-in-law think that because they have been through it, they
    know what is best for our daughter. i love our daughter with all my heart and
    consider myself a good mother. although todd''s mother and mine did very well
    raising us, now it''s my turn to raise my daughter the way her father and i think
    is best. i love mom and todd''s mother very much, and i have tried to talk to
    them about constantly giving me advice, but they get defensive and remind me that
    they have been parents for more than 20 years. both insist that i should listen
    to them. abby, i know claire better than anyone else, so shouldn''t i know the

    i work in a small office, seven women and one man. the holiday tradition is that
    the boss and his wife host a holiday dinner in their home for the staff. last
    year was my first time to attend. i was taught from childhood that when you go
    to someone''s home for a party, you bring the hostess a gift -- which i did, along
    with a small gift for their only child. these gifts were not very expensive and
    our hosts seemed to be appreciative. the staff contributed to a joint gift for
    the boss. upon returning to the office the next work day, i was told by one of
    the longtime employees, "we don''t buy gifts for the boss''s wife and daughter."
    when you work in an environment of female employees, there can be a lot of back-stabbing,
    which i don''t want to be a part of in any way. now i don''t know what to do about
    this this year. i would feel very awkward arriving empty-handed, and yet i don''t
    want it to look like i''m seeking brownie points. although i won''t be comfortable
    with this decision, i won''t take a gift this year, but what should i do next
    year? help me if you can, please. -- should etiquette prevail?'

    several months ago you reprinted a letter from "open for suggestions" about a
    woman who was concerned about her daughter''s classmate who came to school dirty.
    you advised that she contact the teacher, who would then contact the proper authorities.
    i know your heart was in the right place, but really abby, does our first recourse
    need to be contacting the authorities? i have been a foster parent and know how
    frightening the authorities can be to a child and a family. "open to suggestions"
    wanted to talk to the boy''s mother. i think she was on the right track. she should
    have gotten to know the woman as a friend and then made suggestions about the
    boy''s appearance. his parents may have only needed some friendly educating. and
    of course, if on her first visit it was obvious that the child was neglected,
    after that she could have spoken to the teacher. i grew up in a home that was
    filthy. i often wore the same clothes for days. we rarely washed the sheets, and
    i had no idea people ever washed floors or windows. but my parents fed and sheltered
    me. they helped me with schoolwork, marveled at my creations, held me when i cried,
    remembered my birthday, read me bedtime stories and so much more. the things i
    learned from them are more valuable than clean clothes. (later, i learned housekeeping
    from my mother-in-law.) these days people don''t take the time to know others.
    if our neighbors are noisy, we call the police. if nearby residents don''t mow
    their lawns, we call city authorities. if a co-worker crosses us, we complain
    to the boss. i vote for talking out our differences and calling in help as a last
    resort. i learned this from my dear parents, who both held master''s degrees in
    the sciences from leading universities -- and from you, dear abby. -- a faithful

    your answer to "frustrated homeowner," who was upset because his neighbors parked
    in front of his house, was good up to a point. but what if you got a response
    like this: "you don''t own the street. i need the space in front of my house in
    case company comes," plus a few choice remarks about your ancestors? in my case,
    my neighbor''s mother would drive up almost every saturday morning and park in
    front of my house, and her car would just sit there until she left sunday night.
    the curb in front of my neighbor''s house was always empty. well, i had phone
    messages from friends who said, "we drove by sunday afternoon, but didn''t stop
    because you had company," etc. so one day i went over to my neighbor and asked
    him if his mother could please park in front of his house. well, i got a tongue-lashing
    i''ll never forget and went home with my tail between my legs. the next weekend
    i brought the company pickup truck home and parked it so that my neighbor''s mother
    would have plenty of room for her car. on sunday afternoon i pulled the family
    station wagon out of the garage and parked it up close to the back bumper of her
    car. next i backed the pickup close to "mom''s" front bumper and locked both vehicles
    up tight. then i went inside to watch television. about 8 p.m., my doorbell rang.
    it was my neighbor asking me to move one of the vehicles so that his mom could
    get out. "sure thing," i replied. "i''ll be right out just as soon as i get my
    shoes on." then i went back to my chair and continued to watch my tv show. half
    an hour later, the doorbell rings and it''s my irate neighbor wanting to know,
    "how long does it take to put on your damn shoes?" well, after an hour and a half,
    i moved my pickup, and mom shot out of there and burned rubber for half a block.
    i gathered that she was a little upset with me, but she never parked in front
    of my place again. -- vince wogman, chehalis, wash.'

    i must comment in regard to the letter from "hell on the home front" -- the florida

    with no experience or realization of what life is about or the responsibilities
    entailed. i am 28 years old, and being on my own is no easy task. the daughter
    may be crying out for guidance and companionship. instead, her mother is looking
    at her daughter as a burden and distraction -- and even a destroyer of her marriage.
    that mother should take the time to speak with her daughter instead of telling
    her what to do or acting as if she were 18 years old herself. obviously, they
    did not get along in the first place. older teen-agers (or should we call them

    i read your quotes from the courts of law a few days ago and got a big laugh from
    them. but did you know that actions can speak louder than words, even in a courtroom?
    my grandfather, john m. killits, was a district federal court judge in the 1930s,
    and a local judge before that. in one of his cases an injured man was suing someone
    for his injuries, and the defending lawyer became suspicious about the case. he
    appeared very friendly and sympathetic. first he said: "i see that one of your
    serious injuries was damage to your left arm. is that right? how high can you
    raise it?" the man grunted and groaned and managed to raise his arm about a foot.
    the lawyer clucked sympathetically, "my goodness, that is terrible. how high could
    you raise it before it was injured?" "oh, about like this," the man replied, and
    he lifted the arm high above his head. needless to say, the whole courtroom burst
    out laughing and grandpa threw the case out of the court. -- richard n. gardner,

    the letter from the woman who believed candidates would not vote for themselves
    out of "humility and old-fashioned manners" struck me as humorous for two reasons:
    first, in evaluating the current political landscape, from all appearances it
    seems that humility and old-fashioned manners are nowhere to be found. the second
    and more compelling reason comes from my experience in a november 1992 local election.
    although i currently serve as vice mayor of my community, in that election i lost
    my initial bid for office by only one vote out of over 11,000 cast. i can only
    imagine how i might have felt if i had lost the election and not voted for myself!
    of course politicians vote for themselves, and why shouldn''t they? if they are
    trying to convince the electorate that they are the best candidate, then they
    must believe it also. a vote is too precious to waste frivolously. i know. --

    i am a geriatric psychiatrist, a physician who specializes in mental problems
    of the elderly as they relate to legal matters. a letter in your column from a
    woman concerned about her 84-year-old mother-in-law''s relationship with a 58-year-old
    man caught my eye. in addition to your own excellent comments, two more points
    need to be made: the main concerns that arise with aging parents are: 1. does
    the parent have the capacity to understand and appreciate the consequences of
    the situation? 2. is the parent being unduly influenced by another person? memory
    is only one part of the ability to handle personal and financial affairs. other,
    equally important mental functions include the abilities to understand complex
    situations, to reason, plan and carry out behaviors, and to anticipate likely
    consequences. problems in any of these or related areas make a person easy prey
    for con artists and gold-diggers. many people have sound minds, but are inappropriately
    influenced to do things that are not in their best interests. someone who is lonely
    or going through a major change in his or her life is especially vulnerable. the
    unscrupulous thief initially promises friendship and support, then later convinces
    his victim to turn over money or property. many physicians do not know how to
    adequately assess the relevant mental functions. of those who do, few have the
    skills or experience to apply their findings when legal proceedings are necessary.
    the consequences of inadequate assessment can be tragic. for guidance and advice
    regarding problems of this nature, your readers should consider calling the adult
    protective services in their state for referral to a geriatrician or geriatric
    psychiatrist. where legal issues are concerned, such as the capacity to change
    wills, make medical, financial or business decisions, the person''s attorney should
    request the services of a forensic psychiatrist -- a physician who specializes
    in assessing behavior for legal purposes. -- bennett blum, m.d., park dietz &

    my husband of 35 years died recently of aids. he was a salesman, well-liked, and
    traveled a lot. evidently he did more than travel. i was unaware he had aids until
    the lesions appeared. he refused treatment and died a short time later. i have
    been tested and the results show that i am hiv-positive. we have two grown children
    (33 and 30) who are devastated over this. i am in counseling trying to understand
    how i could have missed the signs. my primary problem now is, what do i tell his
    college friends who come to see me? should i tell the truth -- that he had a secret
    life, that i am hiv-positive, that i am terrified? what do i say to our friends
    as to the cause of his death? right now, they think it was a virulent form of
    pneumonia. also, his out-of-town clients who may have been involved in his activities
    could be at risk. how i would love to ask him if the experience was worth the
    pain he has caused. i wanted to divorce him immediately, but he became sick so
    fast and i could not just throw him out, although i wanted to. my children want
    me to keep the aids a secret because of what it will do to their future here in
    town. but will someone at the hospital let it slip? will the doctors make a comment?
    sometimes i feel i''m losing my mind. i have contemplated suicide. my counselor
    says it will take a while to work out my anger. i doubt that will ever be done.
    john knew he had aids long before it became apparent, yet he said nothing and
    did nothing. how vicious and selfish! i am in massive turmoil. my faith in my
    religion is gone and i literally have no one to talk to. so you get to catch the
    flak, abby. my doctor says the largest contingent of new aids cases in the united
    states is women in their 50s or older, whose husbands infect them. they seem to
    think that it will never happen to them. please tell your readers that they too
    can become a statistic and that they should be tested just to be on the safe side.

    grades because i already get them. my mom keeps asking why i wear "those ugly

    to dress like everyone else and look "normal," but that just is not me! we get

  body: 'dear readers: today is thanksgiving day, so here''s my traditional thanksgiving
    column. take a few minutes to think about what you have to be thankful for: how''s
    your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived this long. a lot of people
    haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands -- maybe millions -- are hurting more. (have
    you ever visited a veterans hospital? or a rehabilitation clinic for crippled
    children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear the birds sing,
    use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast table on two
    good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise the lord! a lot of
    people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world is a lot
    poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security. in fact,
    one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are you lonely?
    the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, call someone. go out
    of your way to do something nice for somebody. it''s a sure cure for the blues.
    are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our system has been saved
    by such concern -- concern for fair play under the law. your country may not be
    a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds. freedom rings! look and listen.
    you can still worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret ballot, and
    even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head or a knock
    on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different system, you
    are free to go. there are no walls or fences -- nothing to keep you here. as a
    final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will want to use
    it at your table today: o, heavenly father, we thank thee for food and remember
    the hungry. we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee
    for freedom and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service.
    that thy gifts to us may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving,
    and may god bless you and yours. -- love, abby an afterthought: want an instant
    high? the surest cure for the post-holiday blues is to do something nice for someone.
    why not call someone who lives alone and invite him (or her) over for dinner?
    better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get
    home." (many older people don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out
    alone after dark.) try it. and let me know the results. p.s. special greetings
    to those of you in the military who wrote from remote corners of the world to
    tell me that you are using my thanksgiving prayer on this thanksgiving day.'

    your english-only-or-bust advice to "annoyed in new mexico" was yet another offense

    should it be considered such an offense for two people to use the language of
    their choice to each other? if these two couples are so close, the annoyed pair
    should understand the importance of the spanish language for their friends. how
    the couple speak to each other is their own business, and their use of spanish
    may go back to reasons that "annoyed" does not try, or care, to understand. there
    are many people here in new mexico (and elsewhere) whose parents were severely
    punished for the use of their primary language, spanish. as a result, the next
    generation was taught english only. those of us who learned spanish later consider
    it of the utmost importance to remember our heritage and to practice our language.
    apparently, the new mexico legislature agrees with us: it is the only bilingual

    when i was in law school, i shared an apartment with three other graduate students
    who, like me, held part-time jobs and had little time, money, cooking ability
    or interest in preparing meals. each of us got his own breakfast and we took turns
    preparing dinner -- which usually consisted of a canned vegetable, hamburger meat,
    a baked potato or the like -- and was barely edible. (i lost 25 pounds going through
    law school.) but no matter how poor the meal was, my roommate "joe" invariably
    said, "that was a mighty fine dinner!" one evening, when the meal i had prepared
    was even worse than usual and joe had nevertheless complimented me, i asked, "joe,
    you know that food was hardly fit for human consumption. why do you always say
    it''s good?" "i come from a family of 11 children," joe answered. "my mother would
    spend all afternoon in the kitchen preparing the evening meal. then, one night
    when she called us to the table, there was only a plate at each place with a pile
    of hay on it. my father looked at it and asked her, ''jessie, what is this hay
    doing on our plates?'' mother said, ''oh, you noticed! this is the first time
    any of you have ever given any indication that you know what was on your plate!''"
    "i vowed then and there," joe added, "that i would always express my appreciation
    to the person who had prepared my meal." ever since then i have followed joe''s
    example. (fortunately, i married a great cook as well as the best wife a man ever
    had.) -- paul m. barnes, green valley, ariz.'

    please share something with medical professionals that will be of immense help
    to their patients: when telling patients to perform an action -- "stand on tiptoe,
    squat, turn this way or that, cough," etc. -- and it is essential for your diagnosis
    that they tell you whether it hurts or not -- ask them! i have more than once
    been cut off from essential medical treatment because i did not realize that the
    doctor, dentist, physical therapist, etc. had assumed that an action was pain-free
    because i didn''t say "ouch!" (i didn''t say it because i didn''t know i was expected
    to, and having a fairly stoic personality, i don''t complain about every pain
    i experience.) a similar lack of communication has been mentioned by several friends
    who have been asked, "have you ever had such and such medication before?" they
    have simply replied, "yes," without realizing that the care provider assumes that
    they will mention any bad reaction they had to the medication. since doctors can''t
    read minds, patients may wind up being re-dosed with something they are allergic
    to. remember, most of your patients have never been to medical or nursing school,

    for some time now, i have been reading about parents who can''t decide who should
    inform kids about sex. some argue that the teachers should do it. others respond
    that it''s the parents'' job. is it me, or does this seem juvenile? shouldn''t
    both teachers and parents explain the facts of life to the kids? i thought the
    idea was to protect and educate the next generation. teen-agers complain that
    their teachers can''t get past the biology of it all. they dwell so much on hormones
    that by the end of class nearly half the kids have their heads on their desks
    and they''re snoring. teachers don''t like to talk about the touchy-feely stuff.
    (at least they didn''t when i was in high school two years ago.) if kids want
    a discussion of foreplay, oral sex, masturbation or homosexuality, they usually
    have to rely on their friends, movies, magazines, etc. the parents are usually
    no better than the teachers. they shouldn''t wait for their children -- especially
    their teen-agers -- to start asking questions. sex isn''t something that you shut
    in a closet, then bring out and dust off when a kid comes of age. sex education
    starts when a parent tells a child where it''s ok and not ok to touch someone.
    if a 16- or 17-year-old comes home and suddenly asks his or her parent''s opinion
    about sex, it''s probably already too late. but if that happens to be the case,
    treating the teen as if he or she has committed a mortal sin will only make the
    situation worse. -- jennifer in norfolk, va.'

    i am disturbed that the responses to your "just say no to sex" column were exclusively
    from women. to me, this one-sided representation only serves to reinforce the
    double standard. when are young men going to take responsibility for their own
    sexual behavior? why are young women still burdened with the sole responsibility
    of decision-making when it comes to sex? and finally, why are we not hearing from
    teen-age males who are virgins? abby, young men need to be taught to respect women
    regardless of their virginal status. young people in general need to hear that
    there is only one "first time." when young people feel self-worth and self-respect,
    they in turn respect and value others, which helps them make responsible choices.
    if you have not already asked young men to share their views, i suggest you do.

    my youngest daughter, "martha," is 18 and has moved back home after two months
    on her own. i never knew how much i valued my privacy until my husband and i had
    a chance to spend time alone. now my life has been turned upside down. don''t
    misunderstand me. i love martha with all my heart and would be devastated if any
    harm came to her. but she uses my perfume every day because she doesn''t want
    to buy her own and "borrows" my clothes at will. every night i have to retrieve
    my belongings from her room. if i talk to my husband about our daughter, he defends
    her. if i confront martha, she runs to daddy. the tension around here is causing
    friction between my husband and me. the other night, martha came home at 1:30
    a.m. and proceeded to fix herself a snack in the kitchen, waking me up. the next
    morning at 5:30 a.m., i turned on the stereo, turned on the lights and made so
    much noise that nobody in the house could sleep. my husband thinks i have lost
    my mind, but i''m determined that my daughter is going to have a dose of her own
    medicine. this girl pays no rent and brings home $200 a week. the only thing we
    ask of her in the way of housework is that she keep her bathroom clean. we insist

    i just finished reading the letter from "alone in ann arbor, mich.," who wants
    to save sex until after marriage, but was being pressured by men who wouldn''t
    see her anymore unless she had sex with them. they wanted to take a "test drive"
    before they made a bigger commitment. well, i am a 27-year-old male virgin and
    i don''t understand why more people can''t grasp the logic that sex before marriage
    is not a good idea, not just because of aids or questions of morality, but because
    of wanting to have a relationship that will last in the long run. no lasting relationship
    can be based on how good the sex is, because one day the sex is going to slow
    down or even run out. what you''re left with after that had better be pretty solid,
    or you may as well start shopping for a divorce lawyer while you''re shopping
    for the ring. i know that if i can say i want to marry someone and, in effect,
    spend the rest of my life with her without ever having had sex with her, the sex
    is only going to make that relationship better. has no one else seen the correlation
    between the increase in premarital sex and the increase of divorce in the past
    20 years? i''d bet my life that there''s a direct relationship between the two.
    it seems to me that the problem is that people think love should be based on sex,
    when it''s actually the other way around. i congratulate "alone in ann arbor"
    and every other person who, for whatever reason, has the determination and wisdom
    to abstain from sex until they''re married. -- no name, greenville, s.c.'

    my problem is my mother and my ex-husband. when "steve" and i divorced two years
    ago, there were a lot of hard feelings. my mother is aware of this because i was
    living with her at the time. abby, my mother constantly takes steve''s side over
    mine. she repeatedly "reminds" me how lucky i am that steve pays child support
    and has regular visits with our daughter. i agree that i am luckier than most
    divorced mothers. but when i discuss any problem i might be having with steve,
    mom takes his side and says, "he pulls his own weight." what i would like steve
    to do is to take more responsibility for our daughter. she stays with him two
    days a week, but you can bet that on one of those days he will have something
    else to do -- like work, a date or a ballgame. then he asks mom to baby-sit our
    daughter and mom readily agrees. when i ask her to baby-sit for me, she immediately
    wants to know why. when steve drops our daughter off at mom''s house, family members
    tell me that he usually spends up to an hour visiting with her. i think this is
    strange behavior. what is this "thing" between my ex-husband and my mom? she didn''t
    think he was so great when we were married. why the sudden change? is this my
    ex''s way of staying involved in my life? when i ask mom about this she gets defensive,

    i just finished reading the letter from "responsible adult in new jersey," who
    was sick of the argument that dispensing condoms in school encourages sex. you
    said you anticipated sharp criticism from some readers for printing that letter.
    i''d like to relate a story that made the news here in tucson. a 15-year-old girl
    was raised by strict parents who had not explained the facts of life to their
    daughter. they thought since she wasn''t allowed to date, she didn''t need to
    know about sex. despite her parents'' no-dating rule, she had a boyfriend -- and
    she became pregnant. too terrified to tell her parents, she kept her pregnancy
    a secret. she went into labor and gave birth in the toilet at a friend''s house,
    then strangled her baby and put it into a dumpster. she''s now facing charges
    of first-degree murder. when the parents were asked why they had never talked
    about sex to their daughter, the father replied, "i guess we were waiting for
    her 16th birthday." this girl''s life is ruined. her parents'' lives are ruined.
    and before anyone assumes that this girl is from a broken home or living in the
    ghetto, let me assure you that she comes from a typical, middle-class, two-parent
    family. she was an honor student, a star basketball player and very popular. parents
    cannot assume that because they tell their children not to do something, they
    won''t. in the case of sex, the price the children pay is too great to take the
    chance. most teen-agers think they are immortal. they cannot fathom that anything
    bad will happen to them. their denial is so strong that many of them give little
    thought to the consequences of their actions. my question to parents: are you
    willing to bet your child''s life that he or she will always follow your rules?
    abby, if this letter changes the mind of just one parent who believes that the
    unavailability of condoms will prevent their teen-agers from becoming sexually
    active, it will be worth space in your column. you may use my name. -- carol montgomery,
    tucson, ariz.'

    my daughter recently became engaged to a well-educated young man with a background
    similar to hers. i don''t know her fiance well, but they recently spent a week
    at my home and his behavior made me very uncomfortable. he acted as if this was
    now his home. he helped himself to food in the refrigerator and cabinets, made
    long-distance telephone calls, helped himself to car washing and waxing supplies,
    and was constantly telling me a better way to do everything, from preparing dinner
    to waxing the car. following a huge dinner, he got up with no thanks for this
    expensive feast and raided the refrigerator! in the evenings after watching his
    tv selections, he would disappear into his bedroom without so much as a "good
    night" to anyone. i feel good manners dictate that in someone else''s home, family
    or not, one should ask permission to use things and to eat between meals. one
    should thank the host for meals and hospitality, and make no negative remarks
    about the way things are done. abby, am i being overly sensitive? should i ask
    my daughter if she noticed her fiance''s behavior? i am concerned for my daughter''s
    happiness because she will always have to do things his way and agree with him
    to keep him happy. i fear a heart-to-heart talk with my daughter may estrange

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i was very disappointed in your response to "no regrets" who thinks infertile
    couples should realize that "an empty womb is not a tragedy." "no regrets" would
    rather mentor the children of friends and family than be a mother. she self-centeredly
    concludes that infertile people should give up their dream of being parents and
    instead volunteer at a school. that may be fine for her, but it is outrageous
    for "no regrets" to say that because she has chosen not to be a mother, others
    must abandon their dream of becoming parents. you praised her for being generous
    and for exemplifying the adage "life is what we make it." in doing so, you set
    back the hard work done by infertility support groups such as resolve who try
    to educate the public so that employers, insurance companies, legislators, doctors,
    families and friends of infertile couples can understand that infertility is a
    devastating medical crisis, not a minor inconvenience. we infertile people are
    fully aware of the need to come to some resolution of our crisis. some succeed
    in becoming parents after medical treatments or through adoption. some foster
    or volunteer to help children. others focus on enjoying the advantages of an adult-only
    life. but the road to resolution is painful. our pain is deepened when, out of
    ignorance, people imply that we are making a big deal out of nothing. it is considered
    perfectly natural for people to be joyful about expecting a baby. why then is
    it so hard to understand the flip side -- not being able to be parents causes
    the same measure of grief? my husband and i have had to distance ourselves from
    family and friends who were insensitive when we needed their compassion. when
    they disregard the feelings of infertile couples, we must, in self-defense, withdraw
    from sharing our feelings. thank god for the friends who understood. our resolve
    support group was a lifeline. they gave us courage to get through the worst days
    of a seven-year struggle. no one understands like one who walked in our shoes.
    i''m glad we didn''t give up. this year we were finally able to adopt a beautiful
    boy. becoming his parents has filled our hearts with joy. abby, it is my hope
    that this letter will sensitize others to the pain of infertility, and bridge
    the gap, fostering greater understanding. -- happily resolved in chicago'

    i am responding to the letters in your column about patients being referred to
    as "the boy in the wheelchair" or "the liver." often physicians refer to symptoms
    and diagnoses so they won''t have to disclose patients'' names. (a breach of patient
    confidentiality can have serious legal and moral consequences.) in this way, doctors
    can discuss symptoms or treatment approaches with colleagues without disclosing
    confidential information. i have worked for many years in medical records, and
    we often refer to patient files by the person''s name. some references that i
    have heard include: "has anyone seen mary smith?" "yes, i think i saw her lying
    on the doctor''s desk." "who left bob jones on the copier?" "i''m looking for
    may fong." "well, she isn''t in my basket. let me check my drawers." "can you
    bring mike williams to me? i have to put him in this envelope." of course, we''re

    my husband is a football fanatic. he watches football on monday nights, thursday
    nights and all day sundays. and it''s more than just watching the games. he belongs
    to two football leagues, one of which he runs. leagues mean a draft party, weekly
    mailings, daily phone calls, faxes and computer entry time. pepper that with a
    tri-monthly night out with the boys and miscellaneous sports events, and there
    is very little time left for us! we are newlyweds, and this is not what i expected
    from a husband. he doesn''t see this as a problem, and has made it clear that
    things will not change. he believes that it is i who makes this a problem. abby,
    i don''t even want to bring it up (again) because undoubtedly it will mean a fight.
    i do not expect him to give up football, but i would like him to at least compromise.
    am i being unreasonable? it appears to me that my options are: 1. let him do his
    thing and get busy with my own. (i feel like i''m single again.) 2. complain about

    i am a dental hygienist with a question that continues to plague me. why don''t
    patients brush their teeth before they go to the dentist? i routinely ask patients

    what i pay you for," or, "i only ate a little something since i brushed -- it

    my son (i''ll call him earl) was married in palm beach to a girl he has lived
    with for some time. her family is quite wealthy. the wedding was elaborate and

    wealthy, and i hosted the rehearsal dinner for 80 guests and shared the nearly
    $4,000 in expenses. my present wife, our daughter who is a junior in college on

    were destroyed in the earthquake in 1994 and my wife and i have been struggling
    ever since. my problem: earl is a talented rock musician. his dream is to have
    a career in music, and he has asked me to give him money for expensive equipment
    for a studio he intends to build in his home. his 30th birthday is in late november.
    i don''t know how to handle this. i want to help him. don''t tell me to co-sign
    with him for a loan because when i did that before, i ended up paying the whole
    amount. part of me says, why didn''t they spend our wedding gift for the studio
    or opt for a smaller wedding and use some of that money for their future? as a

    i have been married to a very nice gentleman named "brad" for three years. this
    is a second marriage for both of us. he is kind and thoughtful and enjoys playing
    with my grandchildren, who love him very much. however, he has one quirk: he will
    not allow the children to call him "grandpa." he has instructed them to call him
    "brad." he says the reason is that the grandchildren are not his grandchildren
    -- they are mine. he says when his children have children, they will be his grandchildren.
    abby, this hurts me very much. i never knew my grandparents. as a child, i envied
    my friends who had grandparents to visit. i was so happy when i married someone
    who would be a good grandfather. i am shocked at his attitude. i don''t want us
    to be a family of "his" and "hers." i want it to be ours. when he has grandchildren,
    i''d be delighted to have them call me "grandma," "nana" or whatever. why does
    he feel this way? i''m hurt when i hear my adorable grandson call him "brad."
    in the case of my other grandchildren, he is the only grandfather they will ever
    have, so they''ll never have anyone to call grandpa. is there anything i can do?

    five years ago, our son and his wife were divorced after 15 years of marriage.
    they have two young children. they always worked well together and seemed happy.
    we live 1,500 miles away and our visits were limited to two or three times a year,
    so we were unaware of their marital problems. they said very little about the
    reason for the divorce -- but we have reason to believe that a poor sex life was
    the problem, and a brief try at counseling proved futile. my son and his ex-wife
    are very involved with the children''s school and sports, and they attend church
    together as a family every sunday. we have visited them -- together and separately
    -- and have all laughed and reminisced over old times. they seem very comfortable
    together. my husband and i are concerned about how difficult divorce is for the
    children. since neither our son nor his ex-wife is involved in a new relationship,
    we feel strongly that they should try to get back together. should we arrange
    a dinner and tell them how we feel? should we put our feelings into a letter?

    may i offer a slightly different point of view regarding "d.s.''s" comments in
    your column about explicit articles in women''s magazines? as a therapist, i have
    treated a number of lonely, socially inadequate men and women who have had little
    social contact with others and lack the skills to develop warm and sexually satisfying
    relationships. some of these people have physical disabilities; some are excessively
    shy, withdrawn or physically unattractive. it is this population, and many of
    us who are seeking a little escape -- and yes, even titillation (heaven forbid!)
    -- who read the articles in women''s magazines. personally, i have seen articles
    that were helpful to women who have had very little exposure to the nuances of
    their sexuality. in fact, i have recommended several of these articles to clients
    because they normalize sexuality. i say to women who are offended by these articles,
    "don''t buy the magazines." there''s room for all kinds of people in this world.
    what could be more positive than reading about love and sex? it is my hope that
    those obsessed with pornographic reading material seek therapy, for that obsession
    is extreme behavior which indicates the need for intervention. i suggest that
    "d.s.''s" overly concerned response to magazine articles is indicative of her
    own problems. thank you for giving me a forum. it galls me to see repression by

    influenza, which can be prevented by a simple vaccination, kills as many as 40,000
    people each year in the united states. won''t you remind your readers that october
    to mid-november is the ideal time to receive a "flu" (influenza) shot? although
    flu shots are recommended for all seniors (65 and over), many younger readers
    should roll up their sleeves, too. flu shots are also recommended for any person
    with a chronic illness (such as heart disease, asthma or other lung disease, diabetes
    and kidney disease), as well as for adults who live or work with people who are
    at risk for influenza. flu shots can be given to anyone, including healthy adults
    who want to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza this season.
    while your readers are requesting their flu shots, they should also ask their
    physicians if they need a "pneumonia shot." pneumococcal disease kills about 40,000
    people each year in the united states. a one-time "pneumonia shot" is recommended
    for all adults 65 and over -- yet less than one-third of these adults have been
    vaccinated against this disease. if your readers would like to receive brochures
    about additional vaccinations that are recommended for adults, they should send
    a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope to: the immunization action coalition,
    p.o. box 4627, st. paul, minn. 55104. flu season is rapidly approaching. it doesn''t
    matter how old you are. getting immunized is a lifelong, life-protecting job.
    don''t leave your clinic without making sure you''ve received all the shots you
    need. if you don''t have a doctor, call your public health department to find
    out where you can go for shots. -- deborah wexler, m.d., executive director, immunization

    due to the festivities that preceded the wedding, i kept forgetting to call the
    store to place my order. however, i did put the card in a box and wrapped it,
    so my friends would know they were getting the wineglasses. abby, i still haven''t
    placed the order. a few months after the wedding, my friend asked me about them,

    mentioned it. abby, at the time of the wedding, my husband and i could afford
    the glasses, but now the price has gone up. i''m a full-time homemaker raising

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my grandfather died today. he was outgoing and loving, a pillar of the church
    and did much for our community. everyone respected him, but they were unaware
    of a dark family secret. until i was in my late 20s, no one in our family would
    talk about the fact that grandpa was a pedophile (child molester). he molested
    members of our family -- myself included -- and god knows how many others. there
    were excuses why no one in the family would discuss it. denial was a means of
    coping, and some of us rationalized, "that was a long time ago; why bring up the
    past?" grandpa eventually found himself facing charges of molesting a young neighbor
    girl. the outcome? he ran from the law to another state where he lived the rest
    of his life. our legal system lacks the funds to pursue a pedophile in another
    state. the one good thing that resulted from grandpa being "officially" charged
    was that our family finally started talking about it. in my gut, i always knew
    there was something wrong, but i had buried the past so completely that it took
    several years before i was able to admit it -- even to myself. there are mothers
    who know that their husbands are molesting their children. i hope my experience
    causes others to come out with the truth. were you molested by a parent you now
    allow to spend time with your children? you alone have the power to protect them.
    the problem doesn''t just go away. the first step is to tell someone. remember
    the shame belongs only to the pedophiles, not the victims they violate. adults
    must teach children to protect themselves, and it''s never too late to start.
    you can''t remain silent and protect your kids. you must make a choice. -- living

    my neighbors have a potbellied pig named petunia. the pig sleeps in their house
    at night, but early in the morning she is let out to roam freely and has taken
    to coming to our house to dig holes in the garden and flowerbeds. after the first
    incident, the neighbors told me to just "spank" petunia and send her home. she
    recently decided to demolish my strawberry bed and melon patch. i had put many
    weeks of backbreaking work into them, and petunia not only destroyed the fruit,
    she chewed the roots as well. when i called the neighbors to issue a third warning,
    i was told they were sorry and they would pay for the damage. then they offered
    to give petunia to me. we live three miles outside the nearest town and we''re
    not governed by animal-control laws. (the animal-control people know petunia because
    she often crosses the highway and makes it into town to forage.) their advice
    was to shoot the pig. as an animal lover, i find this advice unacceptable. i have
    two dogs that i keep in a fenced yard and a kennel. they are not allowed to run
    unsupervised to tear up other people''s property. these neighbors claim they "want"
    to put up a fence, but can''t afford to right now because they just purchased
    a new cadillac. four other neighbors in the path of destruction have also complained.
    how can i get through to them that petunia is a pest before someone flies off
    the handle and starts taking potshots at the pig? -- peeved at petunia in elgin,

    "angela in savannah," a pharmacy intern who expressed frustration at the ignorance
    of her patients, asked, "have you ever known anyone to eat a suppository?" well,
    i have. during my nine years of nursing, i have known doctors to prescribe vaginal
    suppositories to be dissolved in the mouth for oral yeast infections. guess what?
    it worked beautifully. what angela perceived as ignorance was a lack of communication
    between patients and the medical community. consider this: when did the use of
    suppositories come up in your normal day-to-day conversation? how is one correctly
    used? proper use of medication is not intuitive. if we, as medical professionals,
    convey the message that people would "know" such things, we discourage them from
    asking. by doing this, we contribute to their ignorance. perhaps we''ve forgotten
    our roots. the word "doctor" comes from the latin word "docere," which means "to

    i couldn''t pass up the chance to respond to "unappreciated in long beach," the
    lady whose husband never remarked on her delicious meals. cooking is apparently
    in my genes, and for 25 years i prepared three meals a day for my husband. his
    packed lunches were the envy of his co-workers, and a dinner was never finished
    without his raving about the meal. it was an everyday occurrence. all that good
    food apparently ruined his brain, because he decided to up and leave. he left
    me the house, the car, the bills and no money. he planned to leave on thursday.
    he asked if i would consider fixing his dinner, letting him sleep at home and
    then send him off with a good breakfast, all for $100. i told him to stuff his
    money and made him leave on wednesday. the clincher came when he said, "well,
    dear, one thing i can say about you is that you''re a damn good cook." say what?
    how about sticking by him after a job injury that he turned into a two-year "vacation"?
    what about staying with him through his job terminations, the bankruptcy, his
    drinking, and the 14 years of child care i did to help pay the bills that he couldn''t?
    and all he can say is that i was a good cook? had i been smart, i would have fixed
    him a last supper that would have had him pulling over at every rest stop between
    here and wherever he decided to go -- and kept his $100, too. tell "unappreciated"
    to keep on cooking, and if he eats it, be satisfied. being told you''re a great
    cook doesn''t amount to a hill of beans if your other qualities go unrecognized.
    these days i cook for my son when and if i want to. i no longer prepare meals
    the way my husband liked them. i don''t have meat at every sitting, i use less
    salt, haven''t had an egg in weeks and can''t remember what a package of bacon
    looks like. my financial picture is becoming brighter now that i''m not paying
    for his keep. i will soon look better and be healthier. he, in the meantime, will

    to be known as "mrs. william jones," not "mrs. mae jones." i was surprised that
    you agreed with her. i have been married to a wonderful man for 2 1/2 years, and
    i was happy to change my maiden name to his. however, my first name is not "robert,"
    and i do not want to be called "mrs. robert anybody"! isn''t it enough for women
    to give up their last names? must we surrender our first names as well? if so,
    then i''ll have to be branded a breacher of etiquette because i insist on being
    known, socially and professionally, as "susan," not "robert." -- susan in chesapeake,

    my husband and i adopted three children when they were infants. they are in their

    wanted to know more about their birth mother, we would tell them. all three have

    a letter stating, "i am your daughter''s ''real'' mother and i would like to see

    by the attorney who handled the adoption that the biological parents would never
    have this information.) i feel angry and betrayed. we have not shared this letter
    with our daughter but on the day we received it, we asked her again if she wanted
    to know more about her background. she laughed and said, "why would i need it?"

    we recently attended the wedding of a grandson of a very dear friend, and sent
    the couple a lovely gift of china and silver. imagine our surprise when we received
    the following thank-you note, which i''m enclosing (i''ve changed the names):
    "dear mr. and mrs. jones, "thanks so much for the beautiful 5pps and for 5pcp1s.
    that was very kind of you. love, sue and george" my husband thinks we ought to
    write sue and george and ask them what "5pps" and "5pcp1s" mean, so we can be
    sure they received the lovely place settings we sent them. we''d have to ask our

    now printed in women''s magazines remind me of the trash published 20 years ago

    i am hoping that you will be able to answer a question that has been bothering
    me for years. what is a "gay lifestyle"? i am a 40-year-old gay male and don''t
    have a clue as to what a gay lifestyle is. my life partner, david, and i have
    been together 15 years and have jointly adopted three special-needs children.
    we live in the suburbs in a middle-class neighborhood, at the end of a cul-de-sac.
    like most of our gay and lesbian friends, we don''t smoke, drink alcohol or go
    to bars. our children go to public school with the rest of the children in the
    neighborhood. once a friend told me what he thought was a gay lifestyle, but by
    the sound of it, he was describing a single''s lifestyle, gay or straight. is
    that what some people mean, that is, a gay lifestyle is synonymous with a single
    lifestyle? if there is such a thing as a gay lifestyle, doesn''t that automatically
    mean that there is a "heterosexual lifestyle"? and if this is true, what is a
    heterosexual lifestyle? i have sincerely been asking people and no one has been

    i am writing in response to the opinion of "ex-waitress," who apparently has a
    problem when a good server approaches her on a personal level. when someone (anyone,
    anywhere), even the "person who has been hired to serve her," tells her that her
    "hair is pretty" or "that''s a beautiful blouse," offense should be the last thing
    that crosses her mind. helllooo!!! she has just been given a compliment on her

    their server when they receive a compliment. should i take offense when a customer
    likes my hair? no, i shouldn''t. my tip to "ex-waitress": either stay home and
    eat, or try a vending machine. then there will be no conversation that may offend
    her. with such an unpleasant attitude, it''s no wonder she''s an ex-waitress.

    how should a girl diplomatically say "no"? she can say, "take me home and we''ll

    the point where she should have said no, and there''s no longer a way to be diplomatic

    should speak loud and clear: "take me home. what''s the matter with you? my daddy

    how difficult it is to say "no." it''s not a matter of being rude. it''s a fear

    and wanting someone to make you feel "loved." abby, it''s scary to say no, especially

    i usually agree with your advice, but you missed the boat when you sided with
    the woman who thought it was improper to have a cash bar at a wedding reception.
    serving liquor has become a liability even if you serve it to a guest in your
    home. if the guest leaves your home and is arrested or has an accident, is the
    guest blamed? no, the person who provided the alcohol is at fault. a nasty lawsuit
    can result, not to mention personal injury should an accident occur. did the woman
    feel she was entitled to free liquor because she sent an "appropriate gift" from
    one of the "best stores"? attending the wedding, being part of the celebration
    and attending the reception wasn''t enough? does free liquor make the event more
    meaningful? i think not. unfortunately, people invariably drink more when the
    drinks are free. paying for each drink is a reminder of how many drinks they have
    had. a cash bar at a wedding reception is indeed proper. guests who must have
    alcoholic beverages can pay for them and bear the responsibility. -- times have

    i am the general contractor for the project the neighbors complained about in
    the letter you published on july 9. it was the third time the homeowners had hired
    me to work on their property, and the complaints from your writers, the couple
    to the east, came as no great surprise. the project was to be finished by june
    15, but due to unforeseen problems, completion was delayed one week. i, personally,
    would have been thrilled if my workers had started before 7 a.m. or agreed to
    work seven days a week, as it would have enabled me to meet the original deadline.
    true, the workers had radios. on most of the occasions when those neighbors came
    to complain about them, the volume was so low i could barely hear it -- and i
    was on the property. once, the offending radio turned out to be in the master
    bath of the house on the other side of their property. abby, los angeles has noise
    ordinances, and this couple called the police at least twice a week. each time,
    they were informed that no bounds were being overstepped. throughout the remodeling
    i frequently encountered, but never received a complaint, from the neighbors on
    the west side of the house. nor did i ever hear a peep from the tenants of the
    three-story apartment building to the rear! in fact, i''ve since been asked to
    bid on similar projects by two other homeowners who live on the same block, which
    gives me confidence in the lack of intrusion felt by the other neighbors. i was
    astounded to see the whole situation in your column. but it answered a long-standing
    question that many of us in the high-tech world wonder about: "can all those letters
    in dear abby be from real people?" -- christianne clark, clark construction and

    this is in response to "available in maine," who lamented that women disregard
    him because he is not drop-dead handsome and doesn''t drive a jaguar. he included
    the ways in which he would show his love if only a woman would see the inner qualities
    of this mid-30s man with a master''s degree. although you gave him sympathy, my
    double-standard alarm went off. suspicious phrases include: "is it lovely outside,
    or is it just you?" and "i''ll hide cute little gifts so i can put a smile on
    your beautiful face." i would be willing to bet serious money that he is not talking
    about inner beauty. in my experience, most average-looking women in their mid-30s
    have long since given up any fantasies of an adonis in a jaguar sweeping them
    off their feet. they are looking for a life partner with whom to share love, respect
    and the storms of life. i doubt these are the women "available" has in mind. i
    would bet that he has his heart set on a beautiful woman 10 years his junior that
    he can put on a pedestal (or in a trophy case). i''ve known several of these men,
    average-looking males who bemoan their lack of success with their latest obsession
    -- who is always lovely and always much younger. i''ve also known many bright,
    witty and interesting professional women in their 30s and 40s who never have a
    date because all the men their age are busy pursuing pretty girls in their 20s.
    "available" might do well to examine his own values first. perhaps he''s the one
    who is passing judgment based on appearance. after all, shallowness knows no gender.
    my husband and i are average on the looks scale. i''m 49 and he''s 48, and we''ve

    my standard reply to a boy who wanted sex was, "do you want to be a father?" that

    this letter is in response to "angela in savannah," the pharmacy intern who''s
    disgusted with customers who are, in her opinion, abusing medicaid and ignorant
    about using their medications correctly. if she spends many years working with
    low-income people, as i have, she may discover that a little compassion goes a
    long way. i am a social worker in a medical setting, and i think angela has jumped
    to some faulty conclusions. what is wrong with our health-care system that a poor
    mother (who may not have money in her pocket for food, let alone cough syrup)
    can get expensive prescription cough syrup for free under medicaid, but must pay
    $3.99 out of pocket for an over-the-counter equivalent? narcotics have many legitimate
    uses. if a customer has a valid prescription for a narcotic, but no money to pay
    for it, should he be looked down upon for hoping he can pay with food stamps?
    and as for angela''s statement that some people are so uneducated they don''t
    know how to take the medicine, what the heck is the pharmacist there for? those
    of us who are fortunate enough to be well educated are continually advised that,
    if there are questions regarding proper use of a medication, we should ask the
    pharmacist. have a heart, angela; lose the attitude, and let''s all try to help
    such people instead of condemning them. -- debbie in highwood, ill.'

    after reading the letter from the pharmacy intern in savannah, i had to write.
    on what basis is she deciding in her brief encounters with customers across the

    drugs? most doctors would not be pleased to know she is diagnosing on limited
    information and experience. if people are "uneducated" in taking medicines, a
    primary function of the pharmacist is to provide information, to educate. most
    of the fine pharmacists i have dealt with value this aspect of their work. yes,
    there are 12-year-olds who get pregnant and who can''t read. should we have compassion
    or contempt for them? and what kind of "insider information" allows this intern
    to sort out the motives of those who apply for menial jobs at the pharmacy where
    she''s working? yes, there are some abusers of programs, and they should be found
    out and stopped by those qualified to do so. i don''t know what kind of life background
    this young intern had, but i would guess it was insular, and encouraged her to
    be judgmental and intolerant. she needs to seriously consider some other line

    the recent letter you published from the pharmacy intern, angela, has me seeing

    it''s a disgrace that people must use overcrowded emergency rooms for mundane
    illnesses such as colds (have you ever had a sick child who is having trouble
    breathing?) just so medicaid will pay for it. has it ever occurred to you or angela
    that these people have no other means for medical treatment? the $3.99 the cough
    syrup costs could mean the difference in whether the family eats or not! instead
    of whining about how people abuse the system, we need to work to make the system
    better. we all know it would be far less expensive to have medicaid pay for the
    doctors'' office visits instead of emergency rooms. with her lack of compassion

    i must respond to "angela," the disgusted young woman in savannah who has recently
    started to work as an intern in a pharmacy. i am sure some of her frustration
    is legitimate, but in one paragraph she stated that some people are so uneducated
    they don''t know how to take medicine. ("have you ever known anyone to eat a suppository?")
    it could happen! this is what happened to me. i was given a prescription for rectal
    suppositories by my doctor. i had the prescription filled at the pharmacy and
    was handed a paper bag stapled shut with the sheet of directions attached to the
    outside of the bag. when i arrived home i opened the bag and read the directions.
    it said, "insert one suppository by mouth twice daily for seven days." the same
    directions were printed on the label affixed to the box. i took the direction
    sheet back to the pharmacy and told the pharmacist i was having a little problem
    following the directions. she looked at the directions, said, "oh, my," and went
    immediately to the computer. evidently that particular medication had been entered
    into the computer so that every time they keyed in the name, it printed out the
    wrong directions. who knows how many people had received the same directions!
    one of the assistants at the pharmacy said, "the first direction should have been
    to remove the foil." we had a good laugh, but it goes to show that even educated

    the woman and her female friend did not object to his coming over to pick up the

    go over and get an eyeful. you wrote: "your neighbor has the right to sunbathe
    in the nude in the privacy of her fenced back yard. better to tell your son to
    refrain from climbing the tree in his yard to get an eyeful." both you and she
    concerned yourselves only about the son getting an eyeful. imagine a gender reversal
    (which is so instructive in these gender-mad times!). suppose the nude sunbathers
    had been men, and mrs. b. had had a 11-year-old daughter. would you have merely
    said she should restrict the 11-year-old girl from climbing trees to get an eyeful?
    would she have simply expressed worry the daughter would get an eyeful, which
    a curious 11-year-old of either sex might do? or would she have called the cops
    and tried to have the men arrested for exposing themselves to the 11-year-old
    girl? our different responses when the gender is reversed in this story reveal

    my standard reply to a boy who wanted sex was, "do you want to be a father?" that
    usually stopped him cold. then i would say, "i don''t want to be a mother, either."
    and that was usually the end of it. once in a while i''d run into someone who
    carried a condom in his wallet, then i just had to give a firm "no." i have passed
    this strategy on to several girls over the years, and they''ve always thanked
    me for the tip. i hope this helps your readers. -- janis c. iminer, pittsford,

    after reading the letter from "wondering in florida" (who sent only a congratulatory
    letter upon receiving graduation announcements from young relatives she barely
    knew), i only wish she were my daughter''s acquaintance. our daughter is sensitive
    and caring, and she keeps in contact with friends and family. however, months
    before her high school graduation, she explained why she wouldn''t be sending
    out any announcements. her reasoning? in her mind, such pronouncements are all
    too often regarded by the sender and receiver as a request for a gift. unfortunately,
    graduation, engagement, wedding and baby announcements tend to carry this unspoken
    message, although i hope that was not their original intention. including a note
    that no gift is necessary would only draw attention to the subject. too bad there''s
    no easy way to reverse the trend, but if more recipients did what "wondering"
    did, families and friends would begin to see the real meaning behind the announcements
    sent to them. in our daughter''s mind, "wondering" wouldn''t have been. -- no

    parents are their children''s most valuable sex educators and should not only
    provide them with "the facts," but also make sure they are familiar with the most
    frequently used "lines" they''ll hear, so they won''t fall for them. they include:
    "you would if you loved me." "everyone''s doing it!" "i won''t hurt you." "i''ll
    still respect you." "i''ll stop when you say so." "no one will ever know." it''s
    important that young women practice what they''ll say before they are faced with
    the situation, because in the heat of the moment it''s often too late. josh mcdowell,
    the author of "how to help your child say ''no'' to sexual pressure," has provided
    the following pressure lines and possible answers: line: "everyone''s doing it."
    reply: then you won''t have a problem finding someone else. line: "if you love
    me, you''ll have sex with me." reply: if you love me, you''ll respect my feelings

    here''s a silly question that has become not so silly recently: about 16 years
    ago, my wife and i had a large wedding. recently, apparently for the first time,
    my mother viewed our wedding album. she took an intense dislike to her appearance
    in a picture of my father and her dancing. this is the only picture of my parents
    in the album, abby, but my mother has requested that we remove it and give it
    to her to destroy. she says she would hate to have her descendants see that likeness
    of her, and she reminded us that she never gave her permission to use this picture
    in the first place. both my wife and i think it is an excellent picture of my
    parents, and had we thought otherwise we would not have included it in our album.
    since in our view the sole objection to this picture is an irrational one, which
    exists only in my mother''s mind, and to destroy it would mean there would be
    no picture of my parents in our wedding album, we have refused her request. are
    we wrong? or does my mother have a right to this picture? ironically, i am a guidance

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am planning to be married next month, and what should be the happiest time in
    my life has turned into one of my biggest problems. the reason is my mother --
    or more specifically, her drinking. she has ruined every affair she''s attended.
    last year at my sister''s wedding, mother: 1. propositioned the judge who performed
    the ceremony. 2. started a screaming argument with my sister. 3. punched me out.
    4. went on a crying jag. 5. fell on the dance floor. 6. got mad at the people
    who were trying to help her and locked herself in the coat closet. mother is a
    darling person when she''s sober, but when she drinks, she''s impossible. afterward,
    when we tell her how she behaved, she doesn''t believe us. i''m planning my wedding
    half-heartedly, knowing my mother will ruin it. i love my mother, abby, and can''t
    have a wedding and not invite her. we are considering eloping, but if we do, we
    will want a reception afterward to celebrate our marriage, and if mother comes,
    she will turn it into a disaster. what should we do? we''re not kids. i''m 42,
    the groom is 52 and mother is 63. -- something blue'

    of yards of material and told me to make them outfits. i thought this was very

    please be brutally frank with me. i am a 60-year-old retired, divorced woman living
    on a fixed income. my 54-year-old live-in lover has not worked during the three
    years we have been together. he says he is married in name only. he owns a home;
    however, we are living in my house. i pay his mortgage, utilities, residence and
    auto upkeep. i also pay for food, clothing, medical expenses and his 1,000-mile
    trips to visit his children, as well as his trips to europe to visit his parents.
    he has (on three occasions) verbally degraded me and i fear there may be more
    coming. we had discussed marriage, but now he says he can''t divorce his wife
    because she has had two mild stokes and his 25-year-old daughter (now divorced)
    would blame him if her mother were to die from the stress of a divorce. i say
    this is hokum! i am very uneasy about any future marriage with this man, and i
    am also fed up with supporting him. the problem is that we are totally compatible
    otherwise. this is very important since it is hard to find someone else who shares
    my interests. i see no changes in the future, and i can''t afford to support him
    forever; it is coming out of my inheritance. what advice do you have for me? sign

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    when i first heard in an overeaters anonymous meeting that compulsive overeating
    is a "disease," i said, "yeah, really!" not believing a word of it. but after
    years of fad diets and 50 pounds of yo-yo weight losses and gains, it didn''t
    take a rocket scientist to conclude that i am different from my noncompulsive
    (and usually thinner) friends. unlike average people who get hungry, eat a meal
    and are then satisfied, i remain hungry most of the time. my problem isn''t lack
    of willpower. what i lack is a reflex, a signal that says, "full! enough!" i didn''t
    choose to have this condition. who in her right mind would choose to be hungry
    all the time? words cannot describe my relief when i understood that i had a physical
    problem. i wasted years feeling guilty and ashamed because of my compulsive eating.
    for me, the solution has three parts because what began 40 years ago as a physical
    condition has created emotional and spiritual baggage that i carry with me today.
    almost everyone has heard of the twelve steps of the "anonymous" programs, including:
    admit your problem; believe you can be helped; ask for help; clean up your act;
    make amends; connect to a power greater than yourself; and help others. these
    steps form a decent life plan for me. they are helping me turn my life around
    and reconnect with myself, my spouse, my work and my body. it does not matter
    that i did not choose to be this way. i am this way. and what i do about it is
    entirely up to me. after one month, following a generous plan of eating and working
    my program with plenty of support from other oa members, i''m one clothing size
    smaller. better yet, i''m not taking pills or herbs, using a fad diet, or doing
    anything bizarre that might cause short-term weight loss. i''m doing nothing that
    i can''t continue for the rest of my life! i am profoundly grateful that i found
    oa, and i''m indebted to the countless oa members who have given me the benefit
    of their strength and experience. -- anonymous'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    your recent letter about cutting costs of wedding receptions prompts me to tell
    you how the majority of residents in new orleans, a city renowned for its hospitality,
    handle this. instead of sit-down dinners that cost "x" dollars per head, we have
    receptions similar to cocktail parties. this eliminates the headache of paying
    for the dinners of guests who don''t show up, and also gives guests a chance to
    mingle without being restricted to conversation only with those seated near them
    at a table. receptions can be simple or very elaborate, depending on the wealth
    of the bride''s parents. what the caterers charge depends on the number of guests
    invited. i have attended wedding receptions where champagne and exotic hors d''oeuvres
    were offered in great variety -- and others where hot dogs, chips and beer were
    served. caterers maintain their own reception rooms, or brides may choose a church
    hall, a community building -- or even their own homes. music can range from the
    strains of an elegant harp and violin group to a lively combo for dancing, or
    even canned music piped over loudspeakers. why doesn''t the rest of the country
    try this? -- m. higgins, a lifelong new orleans resident'

    i am so sick of the argument that dispensing condoms in school encourages sex
    that i could scream. what are people thinking these days? i understand that parents
    and adults don''t like the thought of fifth-graders (or younger or older, for
    that matter) having sex, but it''s a fact that some do. adolescents and teens
    have sex for various reasons. some are responsible and use condoms. but often
    they act irresponsibly and do not. many are afraid or embarrassed to ask their
    parents for them. as parents, adults and educators, we have a responsibility to
    provide young people with the necessary tools for survival in this world. i fail
    to see why anyone, especially our young, should be at risk of death because of
    a mistake in judgment. abby, you have been 100 percent correct in the past when
    you said that if children are at risk of dying, we as informed adults and parents
    have a moral obligation to educate children about safe sex. and yes, that includes
    providing condoms to help young people combat the spread of aids and other sexually
    transmitted diseases. it''s no longer enough for parents to tell young adults
    that abstinence is the best way. the kids know that. but they do not necessarily
    heed that advice. this means that we must communicate to them in other ways. by
    dispensing condoms to young people and counseling them about safe sex, we can
    tell them, "i don''t agree with your decision, but as your parent or friend, i
    don''t want you to die because you have chosen to be sexually active." i hope

    i called bonnie to ask what colors she wanted me to use for the smaller basket.
    she seemed to be in a bad mood and said, "don''t bother decorating it -- just
    throw it out." thinking that would be wasteful, i bought some flowers and ribbon
    and decorated it to match my kitchen. last night bonnie dropped by for a visit,

    i recently married "ed," who is 16 years older than i am. i am 34. my problem
    is his 2-year-old son, "andy," whose mother died in childbirth. this child rules
    our home! he''s been sleeping with his father since birth. i bought a crib for
    andy, but ed refuses to put him in it. he says that since andy''s mother died,
    the child needs to be close to someone to be assured that he is loved. i put andy
    in his crib and he rolls over and goes right to sleep, but after i go to work,
    ed moves him to our bed. (i work the graveyard shift.) when i come home, there
    is andy on my side of the bed, sleeping soundly. after he wakes up, i go to bed,
    but when naptime comes, ed puts andy in bed with me where he plays, talks, pulls
    my hair, etc. ed allow this kid to wreck the house. he also allows him to have
    the say about what he eats, what he wants to do or wear. andy sits on his dad''s
    lap a lot during his waking hours, and if i come near him, he bites or scratches
    me. his father doesn''t scold him for such behavior. when ed is at work and i
    care for andy, he is a different child. he picks up his toys, eats what i prepare
    for him and sleeps in his crib. i have let him know his limitations with me, but
    he also knows i love him. abby, how do i get my husband to see what he is doing
    to our relationship? we can''t even make love without andy crawling over the bed

    i have worked in fire safety for almost 30 years. i thought i had seen and heard
    just about everything, but a series of incidents really caught my attention. we
    had a rash of grease fires around here for a while. one started when a pan of
    grease caught fire on a stove. the owners of the home weren''t watching, and one
    thing led to another. the fire heated up the ventilator hood above the stove,
    and it grew so hot that the kitchen cabinet above and its contents became engulfed
    in flames. can you guess what was in that cabinet? if you said "cooking oil,"
    you''re exactly right. i can''t think of anything more flammable to feed a fire.
    and of course, the fire rose to the occasion. the results were a sight to behold.
    so, abby, your readers might want to take a moment and review what they have stored
    in their above-the-hood cabinets in their kitchens. could it be cooking oil or
    a few pressurized cans? if the answer is yes, and they happen to have a kitchen
    fire they could be in real trouble. your readers may want to reconsider the contents
    of that particular cabinet. i certainly did in mine. -- safety officer in fort

    my wife and i have been reading your column for years and always enjoy it. i would

    in the neighborhood. during the evening, one of the boys took a pair of sugar
    cubes and inked dots on them so they looked like dice. he said to another fellow
    and me, "let''s roll the dice to see who gets to walk mary home and get a goodnight
    kiss." mary agreed with a smile. i was tickled because i was "stuck" on her. i
    won the dice game and walked mary home. being somewhat nervous i kept talking
    until she finally said, "well, are you going to collect your kiss?" i did, and
    it was wonderful. i asked her to a dance the following weekend and that started
    our courtship. remember, abby, these were depression years, so our courtship was
    very modest. on april 8, 1934, we were married. this year, we celebrated our 62nd
    anniversary. when our doctor heard how long we''ve been married, he exclaimed,
    "that''s remarkable. some people don''t live that long!" today we have three wonderful
    children, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. they all adore "grammy"
    because they have fond memories of her pampering them with treats such as turtle-shaped
    pancakes, chocolate-covered cookies, yummy fruit salad, etc. we''re both in our

    says it''s because women don''t think he''s good-looking enough. i''m not drop-dead
    gorgeous, but i got married when i was 25. i had about a dozen proposals before
    mr. right came along. my best friend, brainy and leggy with a wonderful heart,
    could barely find a date. the reason? she didn''t know how to communicate with
    the opposite sex. finally, after much encouragement, she went down your list of
    places to meet decent men and (here is the clincher) she sought therapy. the therapy
    taught her a lot about herself. the church and volunteer organizations gave her
    a place to try out what she had learned. she met a wonderful man who appreciates

    my son is 12 years old. he is quite small for his age, but he is very intelligent
    and normal in every way, except for his muscle disease -- muscular dystrophy.
    yesterday i had to take him to an oral surgeon for some minor surgery. the oral
    surgeon was quite friendly and competent, but his nurse kept referring to my son
    as "the little boy in the wheelchair." when we were in the treatment room we''d
    hear from down the hall, "doctor, the little boy in the wheelchair is in room
    4!" then, "doctor, the little boy in the wheelchair is too low for the x-ray machine."
    then, "doctor, the little boy in the wheelchair is allergic to latex." my son
    finally said to me, "mom, why do they keep referring to me as ''the little boy
    in the wheelchair''? i have a name." being too shy to say something to the nurse,
    he kept silent. not wanting to make trouble on our first visit to that office,
    i also remained silent. i know that it makes him easily identifiable to refer
    to him this way, but he is so much more than "a little boy in a wheelchair." he''s
    a person with feelings. how would they like it if they went into a doctor''s office
    and instead of the nurse saying, "doctor, mrs. smith is in room 4," she said,
    "doctor, the fat lady with the mole on her face is in room 4"? abby, please try

    i am really teed off because this morning i attempted to go for my usual jog,
    but i was intimidated by a car of strange men passing by, honking and yelling
    at me. even though they continued on their way, i was frightened and returned
    home because i was alone. do men think this kind of uninvited, crude attention
    is appreciated by women, or are they just getting their jollies by scaring us?
    i asked many female acquaintances who have experienced this kind of rude behavior.
    i learned it happens often enough to indicate that a large number of men think
    it''s ok, and not a serious problem. fyi, guys: women find this kind of behavior
    frightening, degrading and low-class. people should be able to walk down a public
    street without being harassed, regardless of gender. since men don''t have to
    worry about being knocked down and raped, they have a hard time empathizing with

    i am a 45-year-old, divorced michigan man who has been communicating over the
    internet with a 41-year-old australian woman for more than two months. kate (not
    her real name) stated in our first "meeting" (in an online chat room) that she
    was unhappy in her marriage. even though she was married, i thought it would be
    interesting to talk to someone so far away. we seemed to really click, exchanged
    photos, and even talked on the telephone a few times. our online communication
    has always been pleasant and satisfying -- nothing sexual, just flirtatious. we
    have reached the point where we feel we may have started something we might want
    to continue. kate has told her family and friends that she wants to come to america
    to visit me for a month, and i have agreed to pay half her airfare. ordinarily
    i would not allow myself to get involved with a married woman, but i can''t deny
    i have strong feelings for kate and want to see her. does this sound like destiny
    or an online infatuation that has gone too far? kate is getting a passport and

    offer me some advice. i am a 35-year-old married mother of three. i have a solid
    marriage and a good family life. we are a religious couple who attend church regularly,
    do not drink alcohol or use tobacco, and refrain from using vulgar language. my
    husband works for the city in a 24-hour plant that is manned by all males in a
    situation where work space is shared by all. some of the men have taken the liberty
    of hanging calendars that feature scantily clad or partially nude young women.
    my husband finds this very offensive and against his religious beliefs, as do
    i. one of the other men has the same values, and he took one of the calendars
    down and threw it away. he later was reprimanded for destroying another person''s
    personal property. abby, is there anything that can be done about this? we do
    not feel that another person''s perverted ideas should be forced on the other
    men who have to share the same work areas. my husband chooses to ignore the calendar
    pictures because he feels there is nothing he can do about it. i feel that this
    is a public work area that should be free of such trash. do we have any rights?

    i recently started to work at a pharmacy as an intern, and i go home every night
    frustrated to tears by what i see in a day''s work. there are medical claims,
    hundreds of them daily. many are for preventable sicknesses that could be cured
    by over-the-counter drugs. some people abuse the emergency rooms just to get prescriptions
    necessary for medicaid. an example is cough syrup. once again, the system pays
    a couple of hundred dollars for a child with a common cold whose parents wouldn''t
    spring the $3.99 it would cost for a bottle of cough syrup. abby, some people
    are so uneducated they don''t know how to take the medicine. (have you ever known
    anyone to eat a suppository?) i got a call the other day from a girl who asked
    me whether or not she''s pregnant when there are two blue lines on the stick.
    (she''s 12 years old and didn''t know how to read a package insert to take the
    pregnancy test!) wait -- there''s more. the abuse of the system isn''t happening
    only in health care and pharmacy; we had a job available that women applied for
    via the unemployment office just to get their papers signed so they could keep
    drawing welfare or unemployment benefits. some people have even tried to use food
    stamps to pay for narcotics! i am so disgusted -- maybe i''ll move to canada.

    within the next year i will be getting married to a man who has recently ended
    a 12-year marriage that was troubled from day one. he and his ex-wife had purchased
    and lived in a home not far from the one i now own. he has improved his home over
    the years and the balance on his mortgage is less than half of what i owe on my
    home. since we are both approaching 50, we are seeking to establish ourselves
    financially after his divorce. he wants us to sell my home and move into his,
    although my home has greater potential for appreciation because of its location.
    a number of friends have said that i should be reluctant to move into the same
    house he had occupied with his first wife. i have discussed this with him, and
    he said if selling his home and moving into mine will make me happy, we will do
    it. he also says there are no good memories of his marriage in that house, so
    "ghosts" will not be a problem. he promises we will make our own good memories
    and says it''s not the house but what goes on inside it that matters. i''m free
    to redecorate however i want, and we will make it our home. abby, i''m confused.
    my practical nature tells me that the economics of moving into his home are better

    your suggestion on how to handle inquisitive people when they ask a personal question

    you for asking," said with a smile, of course.) however, i feel as rude as the
    person who asked the question when i use that response. i finally devised a lighthearted
    game -- and it always works. for example, here''s how i answer the following questions:
    q: how much do you weigh? a: a little more than i wish i did. q: how much did
    you pay for your house (dress, shoes, etc.)? a: more than i intended to (or less
    than i thought i would). q: how much is your income (pension, salary, etc.)? a:
    well, so far it''s kept me out of the poorhouse (off welfare, whatever). abby,
    of course they would still prefer an answer, but i use such responses in a friendly,
    playful manner with a smile as often as i''m asked. eventually, they stop asking
    such personal questions and, following a brief miffed silence, we go on as before.
    (or at least i do.) if they are my friends, it turns out ok for me and them. meanwhile,

    i am 24 years old and have been married for 2 1/2 years. i met "rick" when i was
    15. he was my first love. we are not poor. rick works two jobs and i work part-time
    and go to college. after our wedding, i paid all the bills and balanced the checkbook.
    but after a while, i got frustrated because i was a few cents off, so i let rick
    take over the checkbook because he promised to find the discrepancy. a few months
    later, i began getting calls at work and at home about unpaid bills and bounced
    checks. i''d tell rick about them. he said not to worry, he''d take care of it;
    money was just tight. two weeks later, my car was repossessed. we got it back,
    after paying a large repo fee plus a month''s payment in advance. obviously rick
    had lied to me about being up-to-date on the bills. i know he''s not gambling
    or spending the money elsewhere; he was just late paying the bills and it snowballed.
    last week i typed up monthly and annual spread sheets to organize our budget,
    and made it plain that i would have to see every bill that comes in. from now
    on, i will write the checks and manage our finances. rick agreed. he has apologized

    although my credit as well as his is ruined now. at the moment, we are stabilized
    and not in danger of losing our car or home, but i''m really scared. he learned
    his behavior from his mother. (i''ll call her shirley.) when he was a child, his
    father died. shirley is now on her fourth husband. i work with her current husband,
    who makes really good money but is hurting financially because shirley goes on
    spending binges. and this is the clincher: i found out today that shirley was
    fired for embezzling money. she was cutting checks for herself and later replacing
    the money. rick is terrified his mother will go to jail. i''m terrified rick will
    turn out just like his mother. shirley is a compulsive shopper, while my husband
    is merely irresponsible. however, i''m still afraid for our future. this is the
    only real problem in our marriage. rick is a sweet, gentle, loving, funny man
    who will one day be a great father. i don''t want to give up on him, but i don''t
    want us to end up like his parents, either. his stepfather may leave shirley over
    this. am i doing enough by controlling our finances myself, or are there other
    measures i should take? i know that people rarely change. should i leave him?

    i have to get something off my chest. if i don''t, i''ll continue having migraines
    from pent-up anger. my husband and i have an exceptional relationship -- or we
    did have until he took a business trip with his associates. the first day he was
    gone was filled with tours, audits, business meetings, etc. in the evening, he
    called me since i was home with the flu. while i appreciated his thoughtfulness,
    when he explained the plans for the evening, i became upset. i wasn''t happy about
    his going to a strip show, but i couldn''t talk him out of it. (he said he had
    to go along with the boss''s plans so he wouldn''t be branded a henpecked husband.)
    about 1:30 in the morning, he called from the club and tried to convince me that
    the "good ole boys" conduct their business this way, and if he wanted to advance
    with the company, he had to follow suit. he was not exactly sober when he called.
    i trust my husband, and i know that strippers don''t date their customers (besides,
    i''m pretty good-looking myself), but i think it''s disgraceful that wives have
    to put up with this kind of trash in the name of doing business. my husband argues
    that i don''t understand the corporate world, and don''t have a clue about what
    it takes to succeed. abby, am i out of touch, or is my husband trying to sell
    me a bill of goods? -- tired of out-of-town monkey business'

    could you tell me why construction workers feel it is their privilege to have

    a house that has been undergoing remodeling for four months. (the owners moved
    out and won''t return until the work is completed, and who knows when that will
    be?) one day i was subjected to the noise of three radios -- from three different
    construction crews. time and time again i have appealed to the workers, the contractor
    and the owners to alleviate the stress of having to listen to this unnecessary
    noise pollution six and sometimes seven days a week -- often starting before 7
    a.m. nothing has changed. i have no objection to the noise made by various tools
    they use, nor to the shouting, banging and dust attendant with the work. it contributes
    to the betterment of my neighbors'' property and to the employment of people.
    but being forced to endure blaring radios is something else. i have asked the

    when did weddings cease being joyous religious and family celebrations and become
    media events? a clergyman recently wrote to you asking, "can you imagine what
    it''s like to officiate at a wedding with a baby screaming at the top of its lungs?
    have you ever watched and listened to a video of a wedding with two or three babies
    crying while the parents make no attempt to quiet them?" babies are a part of
    the family, abby. i have been in synagogues where babies began crying -- not in
    distress, but simply because babies make noise -- and i have been embarrassed.
    not embarrassed by the babies, but embarrassed by their mothers, who felt it was
    necessary to take them out so as not to "disturb" the other worshipers. i have
    followed mothers out of the sanctuary of the synagogue (when i had the privilege
    of doing so, as a congregant rather than a rabbi) and assured them that their
    babies, in my opinion, enhanced the worship by their truth, their honesty and
    sincerity. what is a baby''s cry if not a prayer? as with regular worship services,
    even more is it true of weddings. yes, i have officiated at weddings where babies
    were present and noisy; i have not been disturbed by them, and by acknowledging
    the delight of the infants, i have kept the wedding party and guests from being
    disturbed. one wedding in particular comes to mind, in which a couple who had
    been married five years earlier in a civil ceremony asked me to preside at a religious
    ceremony. their infant daughter was present, held in her grandfather''s arms,
    and she made noise, as a baby will do. the noises of the happy baby disturbed
    nobody present, and she quickly quieted from the loud noises to gentle cooing
    when i suggested that she be transferred to her mother''s arms. i acknowledged
    her as a part of the wedding party, and the wedding was immeasurably beautified
    by her presence. exclude babies? god forbid that i should ever do so! peace and

    i wrote you some time ago, asking for your help because a girl i had been dating
    was pressuring me to introduce her to my father as my girlfriend. actually, it
    was a little more complicated than that. i am bisexual, and she wasn''t the only
    person i had been seeing. i had been wanting to tell my father about my bisexuality,
    but i was afraid i would lose him if i came out to him. two days before your letter
    arrived, my girlfriend broke up with me because i wouldn''t make the introduction.
    thank you for your very sound advice. i took it and called pflag. i explained
    what was happening in my life and my fear about what would happen if my father
    found out i was "bi." well, a counselor talked to me at length about what happened
    when his son came out to him. he told me that because of the closeness my father
    and i share, i had nothing to fear. he advised me to come out to my father as
    soon as possible. i took the advice and had a little talk with dad, and you know
    what? the counselor was right; my father had known i was bisexual since i was
    13. if i had just talked with dad years ago instead of running away, it would
    have saved me a lot of pain and heartache. please print my letter along with pflag''s
    phone number and address. my experience could be very helpful to some other young
    person out there. you may use my name. -- robin'

    am i the only one who''s irritated by the noise from leaf blowers? i can understand
    using power lawn mowers, but my neighbors now use leaf blowers, too. they''re
    oblivious as they put on their headphones and happily blow leaves and grass from
    one spot to another for hours -- usually on weekend mornings. what a racket! i

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i was very upset a couple of weeks ago, so i placed a collect long-distance telephone
    call to a dear friend whose advice was excellent. when i returned home, my husband
    suggested i send her a check as reimbursement for the phone call. knowing my friend,
    i said, "she''ll never accept it." with that in mind, i sent her a thank-you note
    with cash enclosed to cover the amount of the call. in the note, i suggested,
    "you and your hubby get a triple-deck ice cream cone with the change -- for being
    the dear, generous people you are." (i felt it would add a light, whimsical touch
    to the note.) to my dismay, my friend called and told me she had never been so
    insulted in her life that i''d put cash in the envelope, as she had thought our
    friendship was above that, and she would not hesitate to ask me for anything.
    i told her that she was right, but i felt uncomfortable making her pay for my
    phone call, and this had nothing to do with our friendship. she also mentioned
    that she had a refrigerator full of ice cream and did not need the money. i tried
    to explain that because she is so special, this was my way of saying thank you.
    she still maintains that it was insulting and i was a mile out of line. abby,

    i was intrigued when i saw the letters in your column about forgetting people''s
    names and trying to bluff. they reminded me of an incident that happened to my
    father, who is a 79-year-old baptist minister. dad worked many jobs over the years.
    he had a "paying job" to raise us kids, and on the side he preached. he met people
    all over the southwest, and they remembered him because he was educated, articulate,
    poetic, literate, compassionate, forgiving and loving. (he still is, and he still
    preaches that god is a loving, compassionate and forgiving entity.) dad can remember
    the faces of most of the people he has met, but not their names or the context
    in which he met them. one sunday he returned to a church where he had served as
    an interim pastor. a lady walked up to him after the service and said with tears
    in her eyes, "brother clark, i can''t tell you how moved i am to see you again.
    i haven''t seen you in 10 years." she chatted on about how happy she was to see
    him, and dad tried vainly to remember her name. when she mentioned how much her
    husband had always thought of "brother clark," dad put out a feeler based on that
    continued theme. "and just how is your husband?" "still dead," was the much colder
    reply. it turned out that the last time the lady had seen dad was when he had
    preached at her husband''s funeral! dad not only raises people''s spirits when
    they are grieving, he also raises the most beautiful flowers in clinton, miss.
    (just outside of jackson). my mother is deceased now, but one of my favorite stories
    about my parents concerns a woman who stopped quite often to admire the gorgeous
    landscaping. one day the lady turned to my mom and asked, "how much do you pay
    your yardman?" "nothing," mom replied. "but i have to sleep with him." -- karen

    i am a sailor in the u.s. navy, stationed in sasebo, japan. after serving 11 years
    of active duty and visiting several different countries as a single sailor, i
    finally tied the knot with a beautiful filipino woman i met in manila. she had
    been a high school teacher. i love her dearly. she was (and still is) everything
    i could possibly want in a wife. being in the navy requires me to go out to sea
    quite often, which puts a hardship on our marriage because of the long separations.
    we''re handling the situation pretty well, and we make up for lost time when i
    get home. my problem is my wife. being from the philippines, she knows the reputations
    of sailors in foreign ports. american sailors bring american dollars ashore, and
    most of them are looking for entertaining ways to spend them. (most foreign ports
    have "ladies for hire.") however, i do not, and would never in a million years,
    cheat on my wife, especially with a lady who just wanted my money. when i must
    go to foreign ports, my wife drives me crazy with her suspicions. i have tried
    my best to convince her that i''m not like the american sailors who have a "sweetheart"
    in every port. abby, can you please advise me on how to put my wife''s suspicions
    to rest? -- sasebo sailor'
