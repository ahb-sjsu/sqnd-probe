    our office has breakfast and lunch brought in every day for the staff, clients
    and visitors. they are nice lunches -- steak, baked chicken, sandwiches, pizza
    and barbecue -- and almost every day there are leftovers. there are only five
    employees, and i am the only female. i earn less than half of what the men here
    do. i am also the only one who has teenaged sons. most of the time when we divide
    up the leftovers to take home, i get more than my fair share. sometimes it''s
    by default -- nobody wants them. but sometimes it''s by design. the boss says,
    "take most of it -- you have kids." i appreciate the extra food. with an added
    salad or some extra vegetables, dinner is ready in short order when i get home.
    (plus, it saves me hundreds of dollars each month in groceries.) but i''m starting
    to feel funny about it. is it an act of kindness, or could it have a negative
    impact on my status in the office? or am i looking a gift horse in the mouth and
    worried about nothing? -- ambivalent down south'

    twenty-three years ago my husband and i lost our firstborn son. as my husband
    was active duty military, we could have buried him anywhere in the united states.
    at the time, we were in a place where my sister swore to me she would always live,
    and she would always be there to take care of him. i knew with my husband''s career
    we had many more moves ahead of us, and it helped to ease the loss knowing that
    he would be taken care of. well, that lasted all of three years. my husband and
    i are now at a point where we have settled down and we know where we should have
    buried our precious angel, instead of trusting my sister. we want to have him

    problem is, one or both of our teenagers discover her stashes and the money disappears.
    we have had a family meeting about it, yet it continues. i have argued for years
    with her that part of the problem is leaving money around, not cleverly hidden.
    my wife blames one kid who she wants to kick out, but what if it''s the other?
    now she''s blaming me for not solving the problem. yes, it''s terrible, but she
    has fed the impulsiveness and refuses to change her ways. she wants us to be on
    the "same page," but that usually means her page. any ideas? family counseling?

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    five years ago, my husband got drunk and physically attacked me in front of his
    family. it was horrible. i was in shock, and our relationship never recovered.
    the next four years were a series of court visits for custody of our child and
    eventually a divorce. last year, his mother began requesting visits with our son.
    i was happy about it because i have tried to be accommodating to my ex and his
    family regarding our son. finally, late last year, i called my ex to ask if we
    could sit down and discuss our son (something we had never done). we have met
    twice during the last two weeks, and each time had long conversations about everything.
    (our son, our past, our relationship.) many misconceptions were cleared up, and
    it''s obvious that we both have made many necessary changes within ourselves.
    now i''m confused about what comes next. speaking with him has brought back so
    many feelings. prior to the attack, our stress levels had been high and our communication
    was terrible, but there had been no physical violence. i''m not sure if this is
    the universe giving us an opportunity to give the family we started another chance.
    should we start over? -- wavering in new york'

    when my husband is sick or needs to have surgery, he refuses to tell his family
    and doesn''t want me to. this puts me in a very awkward position. i''m damned
    if i do tell them because he will be upset with me, and damned if i don''t because
    his family won''t trust me, and i don''t want things that way. invariably, when
    he gets home, he calls his family and tells them all about his surgery, and i''m
    left looking like i withheld the information, when it''s not me at all. i have
    asked him what if he dies? his family will be upset not only by the tragedy, but
    also at me for having kept them in the dark. i''m considering leaving him over
    this. i don''t deserve this from him. and no, he won''t see a counselor and i
    won''t do it alone, so do you have any other advice than that? -- in a difficult

    i love my sister and enjoy chatting with her, but our schedules make it difficult
    to connect. when we do speak, her husband often interjects or starts another conversation
    with her, as if she isn''t on the phone. she also settles spats between her toddlers
    and other things her husband could manage while we''re talking. when this happens
    i say, "i can tell you''re tied up. can we talk later when things settle down?"
    her reply: "we can talk now. things are always crazy around here." as it stands,
    we speak only a few times a year, and i''d like her undivided attention. i have
    tried bringing this up a number of times, but she feels life doesn''t stand still
    for anyone. is it too much to ask for 30 minutes, three times a year? we live

    most guys may keep track of how often they''re having sex, although more likely
    it''s how long since the last time, or maybe how many times a week. but this guy
    is an idiot for letting his wife know that he''s tracking it, let alone that he
    has a goal of 100 times. hopefully he''s not procreating, just "recreating" in
    bed. abby, i thought you knew men better. "fifty great versus 100 ''so-so'' times"

    coming out of an abusive relationship in the past, i made some poor decisions.
    i moved away from home and into pornography and prostitution. i come from a small
    town, and it became a big deal when it hit the internet. everyone in my generation
    back home knew what i did. years later, i''m back home. i have a wonderful husband
    and we''re expecting our first child -- a girl. my husband loves and accepts me
    in spite of my past, and my mother has become my best friend. i love my life here.
    nowhere else feels like home. but i''m worried that my child''s life could be
    miserable here because of my past. she will go to school with the children of
    people who know my history. no parent would want their child around me and --
    by extension -- her. she may also learn the unsavory things i did. i''m torn between
    moving away for her sake or staying. my parents are aging and have no one else
    to care for them. they can''t follow me, but say i should do what is best for
    the baby. i hate the idea of deserting my parents when they need me. but i also
    hate that my child will be ostracized. can you help? -- lost in the south'

    what is the protocol for naming a baby after a deceased person? if the name you

    in 1972 when i was 12, my father found out that i was gay, although that wasn''t
    the word he used. after a severe beating that landed me in the hospital, i realized
    that to survive i was going to have to live "straight." eventually i married,
    and for almost 25 years i was relatively happy. my wife died of cancer five years

    i am a mother of four. my oldest son, "jeff," is from a previous marriage. my
    ex was convicted of child molestation, involving his daughter from a previous
    relationship. jeff is now 11. he has had very few unsupervised visitations with
    his dad over the last few years and is always talking about how great a guy he
    is. i have tried to explain that his father has done "inappropriate things" that
    got him in trouble with the law, which is why he can''t have contact with his
    sister. instead of trusting my judgment for having moved several states away,
    jeff always tells me about how he wants to go live with his dad when he''s 18.
    being "big bad mama" is no fun. the once-a-year gifts from his father trump any

    we were visiting my daughter and her husband when their 3-year-old, "bethany,"

    thought she had ingested some, so they rushed her to the er. we were fortunate
    that nothing was found in her system. my son-in-law thinks we should help pay
    the medical bills. i have sent several hundred dollars, but he is asking for more.
    bethany is an only child, and they allow her free reign of the house. i have other

    husbands are a banker and a business owner. all of us are accustomed to dealing
    with "sensitive" issues. a woman at the table next to ours went to the ladies''
    room. when she returned, a short "train" of toilet paper was caught in the waistband
    of her slacks. it was very obvious. there was silence, but a palpable "energy,"
    so the woman knew something was amiss and it might have something to do with her.
    the tissue "floated" with each step, so i knew it wasn''t weighed down with moisture.
    because i didn''t perceive it to be an imminent public health threat, i joined
    the silent legion. did i miss a moral imperative by not letting her know? i didn''t
    know how to do it discreetly. if this should ever happen again, what -- if anything
    -- should i do? -- mr. manners in massachusetts'

    my friend''s husband has been writing a novel for several years. he just self-published

    enter a great review on the amazon page. the problem is the book is filled with
    misused and misspelled words, and there is missing punctuation. he even switched
    the names of two characters. (his wife, who is a "perfectionist," was his editor.)

    my fiancee and i work full time. we are trying to save for our wedding and a deposit
    for a house. the trouble is, after paying rent, bills and day-to-day expenses,
    we are left with next to nothing. i played poker when i was in college, which
    generated a nice income during my late teens and early 20s. a few months back,
    i decided to pick it up again and found a group of people who like to play. since
    then, i have been playing four hours two or three nights a week, and it has generated
    an extra monthly income of $1,000 to $1,500. our finances have improved a lot.
    there are nights my fiancee wants me to stay home. she says if i had a part-time
    job, she would understand why i couldn''t stay home on the days she asked. but
    to me, poker is a part-time job, and it pays more than anything else i could find
    in this area. i play the same set schedule every week, so she should know what
    nights i need to go in to "work." what do you say? -- all-in in virginia'

    no other dessert!" she said she had company coming and needed to take it with

    may i sit in your chair and give some advice today? it''s aimed at men who place
    ads on dating sites and then wonder why they can''t meet "quality" women. i''m
    an educated, decent-looking, middle-aged widow who has dated quite a lot through
    such ads and local social groups. yes, it can be a jungle out there, but the internet
    is a wonderful tool for bringing people together. i live in a small town, and
    the pool of eligible men is smaller here than in metropolitan areas. that said,
    there are few profiles that attract my attention and that of my divorced/widowed
    friends. gentlemen, some pointers: 1. smile! a dour expression is unpleasant.
    2. we may want to see you with your shirt off after we get to know you, but it''s
    not the most appealing or refined pose for a first look. 3. be realistic. if you
    are joe average, we jane averages would enjoy meeting you. are you really going
    to hold out for a model who is a decade or so younger than you? 4. be kind to
    the english language. you don''t have to be a genius, but it would be nice to
    know you can competently communicate in writing. 5. consider a shave. some women
    like men with facial hair; the majority of the ones i know do not. about 75 percent
    of men over 50 have a mustache, beard or both. what are you hiding under there?
    6. if you''re married and miserable, for goodness sake, go for marriage counseling
    or get a divorce. but please don''t deceive women who want to meet a nice guy
    to share life with. in case you think i''m being too harsh, we gals welcome any
    suggestions from men who scroll through those female profiles looking for love.

    was going to commit suicide. i tried to get her to go to a hospital, but she refused.
    when i told her i was going to contact the police, she backed down a bit. this
    has become an almost-nightly occurrence. she''s going through a rough patch right
    now. she''s breaking things off with her drug-addicted longtime partner. she is
    also underemployed, in danger of being evicted and has cancer. it is tough on
    me to talk her down from the ledge every night. many of her problems are of her
    own making, but she can''t seem to see that. she can''t afford therapy. i have
    taken her to al-anon, but she quit after a short time. i don''t know what to do.
    i hate to break it off with her because i''m afraid she will kill herself. i am
    the only friend she has left. how much longer do i hold on? -- sucked dry in kansas'

    i''m a married father with a son 19 months old, and a baby girl on the way. while
    i couldn''t be more excited about my daughter''s impending arrival, i''m unsure
    about whether there is a right time to stop doing things like changing a diaper
    or seeing my daughter unclothed because she''s a girl and i''m not. i come from
    a conservative family, but because this is a new experience for me, i''m not sure
    how to go about it. i know this dynamic changes when these roles are occupied
    by a mother and her son, and that a little boy is probably older by the time the
    transition occurs. i don''t want to end up in a position where my wife or daughter
    regrets my involvement in some aspects of my daughter''s life. any thoughts? --

    my 2-year-old daughter has recently become boob-obsessed. the first thing she

    as the executive director of the hearing loss association of america, may i suggest
    that "mortified at the dinner table" (march 2), who wrote about her in-laws''
    poor hearing even with hearing aids, connect with one of our 200-plus local hlaa
    chapters at www.hearingloss.org? these member-led groups offer emotional support,
    camaraderie, communication strategies and techniques for living with hearing loss,
    both for people who have hearing loss as well as their families and friends. most
    chapters also share information about assistive listening devices that link via
    a telecoil found in most modern hearing aids that could greatly enhance her in-laws''
    hearing around the dinner table. "mortified" might also want to accompany her
    in-laws to a hearing aid evaluation visit at an audiologist''s office to learn
    more about their particular hearing difficulties. there is more to correcting
    hearing loss than buying hearing aids. some users benefit from assistive listening
    devices or from listening training that can be done at home with a personal computer.
    by joining hlaa, "mortified" can receive hearing loss magazine and get the latest
    information about hearing loss and how to live well with it. -- anna gilmore hall'

    brought a shawl to keep warm. when i asked my husband why he never said i looked
    nice, he replied he didn''t know whether i looked nice because he "couldn''t see
    me under that damned blanket!" i was stunned. i wore the shawl only when i was
    near the door because it was cold there. i danced with him and several others
    many times and didn''t have it on then. i must have told gil at least 20 times
    how handsome he looked, and so did everyone else. the shawl may have been a little
    big on me because i am only 5 feet tall and weigh 95 pounds. but i didn''t think
    i looked hideous. i''m hurt over his remark, and we haven''t really spoken for
    several days. what can i do to get past this awful feeling that we''re going in
    opposite directions? -- offended in the east'

    i am a young, recently married woman. my husband and i are about at the point
    where we''re thinking of having kids. my brother married a close friend of mine
    soon after my wedding, and my sister-in-law has a medical condition that may prevent
    her from having children. i am very close to my brother and his wife, and i can
    see the writing on the wall. she has mentioned surrogacy once in passing, as a

    what advice do you have? i''d be more than willing to consider it, but only after

    i have been married for 18 years to a wonderful woman who was diagnosed with stage

    to move to florida so she can enjoy some warm weather. abby, for many reasons

    wife and have income as well. if we move, there would be no guarantee that i could
    find a similar work situation that is so beneficial. my wife says i''m being selfish

    my wife and i both served in the military. when she returned from egypt 19 months

    she said she had settled for second best all her life and that''s what she had
    done with me. she went on to say she knows there''s someone better than me out
    there, and she''s going to find him. all the evidence points to an affair, which
    she denies -- constant trips out of town, emails and phone calls. we are now living
    paycheck to paycheck. we have no more savings and i''m paying all the expenses

    it seems strange to write to you, but i''d like to share this story about how
    small acts of kindness can multiply. on a dark, miserable afternoon, i was out
    grocery shopping. the woman in line in front of me had two small children and
    two full carts of groceries. when all her bags were loaded, she began frantically
    searching in her purse for her car keys. when she couldn''t find them, she realized
    that, in her haste, she had locked them inside her car. i asked if i could drive
    her home to get a spare key and she agreed. i helped her into her house with her
    bags of groceries, then drove them all back to the store for her car. "how can
    i ever thank you?" she asked. my reply was, "no thanks are needed; just pass it
    on." two weeks later, i was at a party when a couple walked into the living room
    and the woman excitedly said, "there she is!" it was the woman from the market.
    she rushed over and proceeded to tell everyone how we met. then she said she''d
    had her chance to "pass it on." i asked what she told the person who had thanked
    her, and she said, "i said what you did, ''no thanks are needed -- pass it on!''"
    small kindnesses bring big rewards. if anyone has been the recipient of an act
    of kindness, remember to pass it on. it''s the golden rule. thanks, dear abby

    i manage a group of 15 employees. a few months ago, i hired the wife of an old
    friend. until now she has been a great employee, but recently she and a male co-worker
    have been taking lunches and breaks together in a way that leads me to believe
    they are flirting or have already crossed the line. because we have a small group,
    i worry about how this will affect my team, who know that she''s married. i also
    feel bad for the husband, who is a very caring and kind man. as a manager, i don''t
    think i can say anything unless their liaison interferes with their work performance.

    my 83-year-old mother has decided she wants to die. she says she''s miserable,

    my daughter goes to a preschool in a church where we are not members. pastor "joe"
    is very involved with the classes, often chatting with the parents and calling
    them by their first names. i have seen him around town various times, but i''m
    never sure how to address him. i feel strange calling him "pastor" since he isn''t
    my minister. on the other hand, calling him "joe" doesn''t quite seem right either.

    i use a service dog, and i''m constantly barraged with requests to pet him. other
    people who use service dogs warned me this would happen. although the ada does
    not require him to wear a vest, i bought one for him that reads, "do not pet,"
    which he wears in public. they ask me anyway! they also ask what i use the dog
    for. sometimes i''m tempted to say, "first, tell me about your medical history
    and then i''ll tell you mine." i don''t mind quietly and discreetly discussing
    with a store owner what my dog does, but for a stranger to walk up and expect
    me to share personal information is rude. as excited as i am about how my dog
    has expanded my life, i do not want to spend my time answering strangers'' questions
    or hearing about every dog they''ve ever owned. obviously, i''m still learning

    my wife and i are retired. everything was great until about six months ago, when
    things radically changed. the issue is i stopped shaving every day. i did it when
    i was working, but i don''t feel the need to do it now. my wife strongly disapproves.
    she claims my unkempt appearance is a direct, negative reflection on her. i feel
    it reflects only on me. i have told her i will shave prior to any social engagement
    we both attend, as well as public events like civic club, etc. the guys i play
    cards with also go unshaven. my wife has threatened to cancel card games with
    friends, cancel our weekend trip to her brother''s birthday celebration, cancel
    our upcoming european river cruise, refuses to kiss me and said some things i
    can''t repeat. is there anything i can do to appease this lady i love dearly?

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    when i was in my early 20s, i had a baby boy i placed for adoption. i could barely
    take care of myself, let alone a newborn. the father wanted nothing to do with
    me or the baby, so i placed him with his relatives out of state, who adopted him.
    with counseling, i got my life back on track, finished college and got a good
    job. i am married now and have a family. after 20 years, this child, "fred," called
    me. we talked every night for a few weeks and i invited him here to live with
    me. big mistake! long story short, fred is greedy, lazy and expects everyone to
    wait on him. he refuses to look for a job or go to school, and he expects me to
    pay all his expenses. i called his adoptive family. they said when things don''t
    go his way, fred pouts and doesn''t communicate until he needs money. they feel
    exactly as i do -- he should get a job or go to school. abby, my family loves
    fred and welcomed him with open arms, but i feel detached from him. as soon as
    i learned i was pregnant, i began separating myself because i knew it would be
    difficult to let go. i do not regard fred as a member of my family and have no
    maternal feelings for him. i''d be ok if i knew he was doing well -- from a distance.
    but i''d prefer not to maintain a relationship. i don''t love this young man,
    and i don''t know what to say when he says, "love you, mom." am i wrong to feel
    this way? is there anyone else out there who feels as i do? my family is trying
    to guilt me into accepting him, but i can''t. it''s not because of his greedy
    behavior, although that''s part of it. have others had a similar experience? --

    my brother is dating one of my employees. she has one of those "take charge" personalities.

    was a surgeon. when i could find no information on her, i started looking up other
    things. abby, i could find nothing about him or his family. his mother does not
    have a medical license, and there are no property records or any record of a marriage
    license to his second wife. when i confronted him, he was furious and accused
    me of not trusting him. now he doesn''t want anything to do with me. i''m heartbroken.
    i loved him years ago and thought this was for real. i feel guilty for not trusting
    him, even though i know he hasn''t been honest with me. is it wrong to do background

    it absolutely frosts me when parents head for the toy department so their children
    will have something to play with while they shop. then, after the kids have spent
    time drooling, teething, sneezing, etc., they leave the dirty toys at the end
    of the aisle for someone else to buy. yesterday i saw a child sucking on the paw
    of a stuffed animal. when i commented on how that must be the child''s favorite
    toy, the mother said it wasn''t theirs -- she was just keeping the little boy
    quiet while she shopped. last week i stood behind someone in the checkout line.
    in her child''s mouth was the ribbon from a mylar balloon. when the mother finished
    loading her groceries onto the conveyor belt, she said, "time to put this back
    now!" it''s my pet peeve: first the germs they get from sucking on this stuff,
    then the ones everyone else is exposed to from the child. and on top of that there''s
    the stealing, because i have seen children break toys. this is wrong, and we''re

    i''m a single mom in a serious relationship with a divorced man who has children
    of his own. between us, we have seven, ranging in age from 7 to 17. i''m in my
    early 30s; he''s in his early 50s. my dilemma: i''m interested in having another
    child if we get married. he definitely isn''t. is it unreasonable for me to want
    to add to this already large potential blended family? i love the idea of experiencing
    motherhood again with a little more experience and age under my belt, and i''d
    love to share that intimacy with him. while he likes the abstract possibility
    of "our" child, he says he feels too old now and he wouldn''t be able to be the
    kind of father he would want to be. if neither of us had kids of our own, this
    would be a deal-breaker for me, but how do i know if my maternal longings are
    just the last, painful tickings of my biological clock, or a real desire that
    i''ll end up resenting him for if i ignore it and we stay together? -- is seven

    i recently became involved with a longtime female friend of mine when she was
    in town. i have always loved "miranda" as a friend, but now i also feel attracted
    to her as a potential perfect match. the problem is she lives far away. we keep
    in touch almost daily. i love that, but it makes me miss her, and i end up thinking
    about her all day, which doesn''t help. she says she has feelings for me, too,
    but "the timing isn''t in our favor." what can i do to go about my day without
    letting thoughts of miranda rule my brain? i am 27 and haven''t felt like this
    about anyone before. we''ll see each other in a couple of months and the time
    couldn''t be crawling by any slower. abby, are long-distance relationships even

    i have an extremely bright 7-year-old daughter, "amy," from a previous marriage.
    her biological father, "jake," and i separated when she was an infant. he lives
    across the country, so while we shared custody, amy usually saw him only once
    a year. for a while i called him "dad" when talking about him to her, but when
    it became apparent that he wasn''t going to be involved in her life (and because
    i was going to be remarried), we switched to using his first name. my current
    husband formally adopted amy last year, and she couldn''t have been happier. now
    there''s a baby sister, and amy is overjoyed. recently, though, amy has started
    asking me why jake never visits and when she''s going to see him again. i don''t
    know what to tell her. i feel it would be crushing to her to say that jake isn''t
    interested in her anymore, but i also don''t want to lie to her. how do you tell

    my husband is a hard worker, a good provider and a good dad. however, he''s angry
    all the time. it has been this way for as long as i can remember. he is aware
    of it, and always promises me that when this or that settles down, things will
    get better, but they never do. when he sees something on tv or reads something
    in the paper that upsets him, he can say really vile and violent things. often
    when he thinks things the kids and i do are not good enough, he borders on being
    verbally abusive. his friends say i''m a "saint" for putting up with him, but
    lately all i feel is tired out and worn down by it. i have spoken to him about
    this numerous times, and it improves for a few days, then it starts all over.
    i''m not sure how much longer i can last. he reads your column, and i''m hoping
    he''ll see this and realize how bad things really are. i have asked him to go
    to counseling, but he hasn''t been willing. do you think there''s anything i can

    with their adult daughter. she was lonely and i knew the family, so i wasn''t
    concerned. their relationship developed into something more and we separated.
    he ended their friendship and we reconciled. things were going great, but she
    continued to contact him. he has suddenly decided he can''t live without her friendship
    and has decided to divorce me in order to continue it with her. he swears it''s
    platonic, but something he can''t live without. he hopes we can "still be friends"!
    my question is how to move on from this. i have to see her enabling parents every
    day at work, and all of this happened under their roof. i feel betrayed on every
    level, especially by my husband, who was my best friend. every aspect of my life,
    including my job, has been affected. have you any advice for moving past this
    without all of the anger i carry? i don''t want to leave my job. it pays well

    once a year i type my zip code into a website to see who the registered sex offenders
    are in my area so i can be better informed and protect myself and my family. a
    photo, address and the charges attributed to the offender are posted on the site.
    my jaw dropped to the floor when i saw a man listed that i work with and see quite
    often. the picture looked recent. i haven''t said anything to him. i have known
    this person for five years and thought he was a good guy who respected women.
    i''d like to think it was a one-time mistake and that he would never do it again.
    but would he? should i tell my teenage daughter who sometimes visits me in the
    office? should i tell the other women who work here? if a co-worker knew this
    kind of information and showed it to me, i''d be grateful to know. what do you
    think i should do? -- stunned in the city'

    my husband, "george," and i have been married for 13 years. last night he dropped
    a bombshell. he told me that while he loves me, he isn''t happy. he assured me
    he has no inclination to divorce me, but he pretty much laid the entire reason
    for his unhappiness at my feet. i don''t handle people well. i love george and
    our son, but i am most relaxed and comfortable when i''m by myself. i don''t neglect
    them. we do lots of stuff outside the house as a family. i have no close friends,

    friends. i have never tried to stop him. in fact, i have encouraged him to cultivate
    friendships and hang out with "the guys," join groups, etc. he says he can''t
    do that and leave me at home. i wouldn''t mind his going out, but it''s nerve-racking

    enough with the problems! it''s time you printed a positive letter. i''m an active,
    friendly senior who lives alone, but i''m not lonely. i have many friends of all
    ages and a devoted family. why? because as i traveled through many states during
    my life, i reached out to people along the way. the saying, "if you want a friend,
    be a friend," is true. if we want friends, we can''t sit back and wait for people
    to come to us. smile, speak up, pay a sincere compliment -- just communicate!
    if you do, the majority of people will respond positively. i socialize with people
    my age in church circles, card clubs and dining-out groups who can''t understand
    why i''m always so busy. they don''t reach out except to people they already know.
    as people get older, that group is constantly shrinking. join a religious group,
    community clubs and organizations. volunteer to read at schools and libraries.
    visit a senior group or center. many people of all ages fear they won''t be accepted.

    i am generally a conservative person. my 17-year-old son, "leo," asked for an
    ear piercing when he was 13. i wasn''t sure whether i liked the kind of impression
    it made, but because it was only one piercing, i agreed on the condition that
    he would stop at one hole. when leo was 15, he begged to have dreadlocks. thinking
    it was a phase, i allowed it even though i wasn''t thrilled. he has since cut
    off the dreads, but now says he wants an eyebrow piercing. my son is a loving,
    wonderful, happy kid. he''s active in school, well-liked, and an excellent student
    in an advanced academic program. i couldn''t honestly think of a good reason to
    say no, even though this piercing freaks me out. i sense that leo wants to do
    more piercings, but he''s respectful enough to wait awhile. my question is, what
    is a good reason to not agree to more piercings? every argument i''ve thought
    of -- unsightly, unsanitary, makes the wrong impression -- is rather thin. my
    12-year-old daughter wants to dye her hair purple. i''m saying no, but still have

    i''m a 28-year-old woman with a fantastic job, a wonderful boyfriend and many

    is children. whereas before, we were interested in each other''s lives, i feel
    like my concerns and accomplishments are being brushed off. an example: i was
    excited to meet up with a pal to talk about my promotion, but the hour-long dinner
    was spent mostly teaching her child how to walk between the tables of the restaurant.
    i enjoy hearing about my friends and their families, but i feel they are no longer
