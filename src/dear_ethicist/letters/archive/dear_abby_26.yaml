    is it socially correct to have a housewarming party for someone who has lived
    in the home for more than 10 years? the party is scheduled to be held at a restaurant.
    the idea for this party was the "honoree''s" mother''s because her daughter has
    never been married or had a child, and her mother thinks that the people she has
    given gifts to all these years owe her something back. i have never heard of such
    a party, but others think it''s a great idea. -- confused in spencerport, n.y.'

    one of my sons, "clayton," is in his early 20s -- tall, slim, handsome and intelligent.
    he dated a girl in high school, "julie," who was the love of his life. they broke
    up and got back together several times, until she finally moved on and married
    a nice young man. clayton graduated from college and has a well-paying job. the
    problem is, all he does is go to work and stay in his room watching tv (yes, he''s
    still at home with my wife and me) until it''s time to go back to work. rarely
    does he even eat dinner with us. he does go to church on sunday mornings, but
    speaks to no one, even though people try to talk to him. several people his age,
    male and female, have approached him trying to strike up a conversation, but he
    is rude to them and won''t even say hello. he refuses to go to restaurants with
    us because he "might see someone" he knows. he says that julie was the only girl
    for him, and if it''s not julie then he isn''t interested in anyone -- ever. any
    suggestions? we don''t necessarily want him to date if he doesn''t want to, just
    to have some friends, male or female, and get a life. -- disturbed dad in south

    i am a single, 32-year-old woman with an older sister who has 12 grandchildren
    from her three kids. no matter how hard i try to be fair to all the kids, their
    parents and grandmother get angry at me for splitting the children into groups
    and not taking them all together all the time. i try to split up the outings into
    age-appropriate activities, but that apparently isn''t good enough. they insist
    that i am not being entirely fair to the group. abby, i admit i sometimes ask
    the older children, particularly the three soon-to-be-teenage girls, over for
    slumber parties a little more often than i do the others -- but that''s because
    they are growing too old to want to spend time with their aunt, and i want to
    take advantage of whatever precious time i have left with them. the little ones
    will have their turn as pre-teens, too. is there something wrong with splitting
    them up into smaller groups so i can spend quality time with each instead of simply
    baby sitting or playing referee? am i asking too much to expect the parents of
    the younger children (ages 7 and under) to explain to them that they are just
    too little to go some places, with the promise of an outing just for them later?
    if you think i''m being unfair, i''ll have to stop all the slumber parties because
    i just can''t handle all the kids all the time. but if you agree with me, how
    do i get their parents to chill out? -- frustrated aunt in indiana'

    i recently ended a nine-month relationship with a 40-year-old man i''ll call shallow
    hal. i was head over heels in love with him. we had a lot in common and our personalities
    were compatible, but there was one major problem. hal loved everything about me,
    but his love for me was contingent upon my losing weight. hal told me that when
    i lost weight, he would treat me better, let me meet his family and introduce
    me to his friends. until i did, he denied me all those things, including hugs
    and kisses. for nine months hal strung me along, and i believed that losing weight
    would change everything and we would end up together, happily ever after. i am
    currently working on my master''s in counseling psychology, and i should have
    known better. clearly, hal did not accept me for who i was, and i should have
    ended the relationship long ago because he was not into me. some days he didn''t
    know if he ever wanted to get married and have kids; other days he did. he was
    definitely unstable. why did i put up with this when i was the one who did all
    the driving to his house and all the courting? and how do i keep all this from
    replaying in my mind? i hear his weight comments over and over, and it''s self-destructive,

    i am 33 and have been dating "lauren" for three years. i saw a great future together
    -- that is, until my parents decided they hated lauren and refused to meet her.
    my parents are unreasonable and judgmental. they say i should marry a "family-oriented"
    girl who meets their qualifications. i moved back home after college and have
    had relationships, but never married. having no siblings, i have always been super
    close with my parents, but they are doing everything in their power to destroy
    my relationship with lauren and control me. we can''t communicate respectfully
    about this because they claim that "desperation" has caused me to "settle" and
    accuse lauren of turning me against them. although they say they want me to be
    happy with a family and to make my own decisions, they have informed me that they
    will not attend our wedding, nor be a part of our lives. lauren and i get along
    well and love each other. she is willing to start all over with them and forget
    what has happened, but they still refuse to meet her. i feel that i am still the
    only person who can determine what "qualifications" are important to me in a life
    partner, but my parents are forcing me to make a choice. should i continue trying,
    or move on? -- on the spot in new jersey'

    i''m a former army recruiter. i understand the fear that "cleveland mom" and her
    husband are facing. i faced it myself as i enlisted young men and women knowing
    that the answer to, "am i going to iraq?" was, in many cases, "yes." regardless,
    our army is necessary and does not serve solely for the conflict in iraq. our
    military is equipped, trained and ready to serve not only in combat, but in humanitarian
    support as well. my recommendation to your readers is not to discourage youth
    who wish to serve. rather, assist them in asking smart, pointed questions when
    they visit their recruiter. a good recruiter will answer honestly and to the best
    of his or her ability. it is also common for a family member to request to accompany
    their recruit as he or she chooses a job at the military entrance processing station.
    some things to bear in mind: every service is different in its job assignments
    and contract length. jobs are based on the armed services vocational aptitude
    battery score, physical ability, moral background and availability. everyone signs
    up for eight years of military service obligation (generally two to four years
    active service, with the remainder as an inactive reservist), and only 15 percent
    of the population ages 17 to 24 is qualified to serve. -- jerold z., sgt. 1st

    i have always had a difficult relationship with my siblings. i have befriended
    them and tried to do for them, but they are mean-spirited and selfish. my brother
    has also physically abused me. (he has been jailed several times for hitting his
    longtime girlfriend.) when i turned 40 this year, i finally decided that enough
    is enough. my psychiatrist, my husband and my friends agree that it''s time for
    me to set boundaries and end these toxic relationships. i feel good about my decision.
    the problem is that my parents do not. they feel my two daughters, ages 4 1/2
    and 20 months, should have a relationship with their aunt and uncle even if i
    don''t. they accuse me of "brainwashing" my children and insist that my girls
    be allowed to see my siblings regularly and "make up their own minds" on the subject.
    i say it is my responsibility to protect my daughters and that my decision should
    be respected. last weekend, when my older daughter was visiting my folks, they
    invited my brother to visit. they knew this was against my wishes and did it behind
    my back. naturally, my daughter told me about it. moreover, whenever my daughter
    visits them, they put her on the phone with my siblings and try to forge a relationship
    between them. because of all this, i told my folks they may have only supervised
    visits with my children. do you think this was going too far? -- karen in atlanta'

    his financial picture is not a good one. there are foreclosures, liens, bankruptcy,

    name. i mean, if you don''t like the name or don''t want your kid to be called
    that, why give them that name? i understand with older kids it can be a matter
    of choice, or with "juniors" and others, it''s a way to distinguish a father from
    a son. but this happens too often, and i dislike being snapped at because i called
    their son or daughter by his or her first name. so why is it such a common practice?

    my sister, "jane," and i are both in our mid-50s. jane has had numerous affairs
    over the past several years after her third divorce, and was involved in an "intimate
    relationship" with a terrific man, "will," that lasted about three months. jane
    broke up with will several months after she decided he wasn''t what she was looking
    for, and she''s presently engaged to be married to a very nice man ("sam") and
    seems very happy. i dated will several times before he and jane became involved.
    we weren''t intimate at that time, and we started seeing each other again over
    the last month. this time we have fallen in love. my problem is jane is upset
    that will and i are together and says i have "betrayed" her. she is worried about
    having her former and current lovers present at family gatherings, and our parents
    are also concerned. they say it''s "just weird." the fact that my sister was intimate
    with will doesn''t bother me or will, but it sure bothers them. abby, i have always
    been the "good girl" in the family and bowed under their pressure, but my relationship
    with will is more than i could have ever imagined, and i don''t want to give up
    my future happiness just to make my sister and my parents more comfortable. my
    adult children have all met and approve of will and our relationship, but jane
    and my parents won''t budge. any suggestions? -- wants will in walla walla, wash.'

    my mother-in-law, "sally," is a pack rat. she cannot bear to throw anything away.
    the items she is willing to part with, she donates to the local thrift store where

    throwing her tattered and broken belongings away, she unloads them on the thrift
    shop in the hope that someone else will be able to find a use for them. recently,
    several friends who also volunteer at the store made it known to me that they
    did not appreciate sally''s donations because it takes them several hours to sort
    through the items, only a few of which are suitable for resale after cleaning
    and repairs. frankly, i agree. because sally usually drops her items off in the

    at my last job, there was a privacy policy in place in which no one could ask
    nor discuss another worker''s medical condition or reason for taking medical leave.
    however, "thelma," the coordinator at my present job (i''ve been here two years),
    constantly badgers us and insists that we tell her our reason for medical leave
    or what our medical condition is. i have noticed that she repeats to others what
    is told to her; therefore i do not tell her anything. thelma recently sent around
    a sympathy card for everyone to sign for a woman in another department who had
    suffered a miscarriage. (i had no idea the woman was even pregnant.) i thought
    the card was tacky and a form of gossip, and i told the coordinator so. her response
    to me was that this woman has had other miscarriages! how can i put a stop to
    her insensitivity and gossip? should i go over thelma''s head and report her,

    my fiance''s brother, "nate," is going through a separation from his wife of 11
    years, "joanne." everyone on nate''s side of the family is giving him all the
    support they can, but they are still very close to his wife. they realize he is
    an emotional cripple, prone to fits of rage and depression. in order to save his
    marriage, nate agreed to therapy and has been going regularly in the hope of saving
    the children from the experience of a messy divorce. abby, nate talks about having
    a "dark side" and often talks about doing physical harm to his wife. he admits
    that he has not mentioned these feelings to his therapist, which means he is wasting
    his time there. i would never forgive myself if something should happen to joanne.
    should i contact her and let her know? she already knows about his potential for

    how do i politely tell my mother-in-law to stop doing my laundry? it all started
    when i was on bed rest due to my pregnancy. i didn''t mind her doing an occasional
    load to help us out. but now she does it anytime she''s over to watch the kids.
    i''m very picky about how i do my laundry, and this is the main reason i don''t
    want her doing it. also, i''d prefer she spend time playing with the kids than
    with the laundry! she also puts things away in the wrong places. she does it with
    my dishes, too. once i told her not to worry about my laundry because i wasn''t
    done sorting it. she took it upon herself to do it anyway. she''s very strong-willed.
    my husband and i have had problems with her not respecting our parenting, too.
    she often takes things the wrong way. what''s the best way for us to tell her
    that her help is not needed? -- dirty family laundry'

    my wife and i disagree on discipline when other children come over to play with
    our 4-year-old daughter. i believe we have the right to tell them "no" in our
    own house, and she says we should wait and tell the parents. a recent example:
    a friend came over and got bored playing with our daughter, so he went to her
    room and dumped all of her toys on the floor. still bored, he went to the living
    room and proceeded to dump a 300-piece container of legos all over the floor.
    i told him he should not do that and should pick up the pieces and then take them

    late last summer, we invited another couple -- good friends -- over for an informal

    and don''t mind adding them to a meal. however, because the dinner was already
    on the table, i had to put everything on hold and find a way to keep everything
    warm while i prepared what they had brought. i take pride in preparing a good
    meal and worried that it might not taste the same after having sat for 15 or 20
    minutes. i feel they should have let me know in advance so i could have had water
    boiling when they arrived. at the time, my husband told me not to say anything

    my brother and i are one year apart and grew up practically as twins. we buried

    and married a woman. we still lived together, only with hostility and distance.
    five years have gone by, and we now live apart. however, the feelings of hurt
    still remain -- and in fact have intensified. recently i wrote a letter to him
    expressing my anger about the past, and he cut me off permanently. we both understand
    that we needed to separate and how unfortunate it was that it happened with a
    lot of anger and resentment. however, i am being married this summer and am unable
    to decide if i should invite him to the wedding. on the one hand, i don''t want
    to create another wound, but on the other, it feels as if we have finally broken
    free, and it is time to move on and respect his wish to be rid of me. i am actually

    instead for "flings." i have, however, become attached to one "fling" in particular.
    he is 31 and lives close by. i have known him almost six months. we have an "arrangement"
    -- we are "friends with benefits" only. however, i no longer want this. i want
    to take it to the next level. i have developed deeper feelings for him and have
    told him so. he has not voiced the same sentiments. he said he was hurt in the
    past and doesn''t want to be hurt again, so he doesn''t get involved. he sends
    me mixed signals, and i am confused. he doesn''t call for weeks, then calls several
    times a week "just to talk." when i leave him, sometimes he barely notices; other
    days he''ll walk me to my car and send me off with a kiss. he sends cute e-mails
    and gives me trivial gifts. i feel like a pseudo-girlfriend. i am there when he
    has time for a "girlfriend" type. i don''t know where i stand with him. should
    i wait it out or just let him go? he''s a great person and an awesome man. i care
    for him on many levels. i want our relationship to progress, but i feel him holding

    i''m 19 and dropped out of college in december 2005. after years of going through
    honors classes, i felt like i had nothing left. my brain was on cruise control.
    i was present but my mind wasn''t. i''d go to class and feel like a shell. my
    friends and family attribute it to laziness. i felt like i didn''t know what i
    wanted to do and was wasting my father''s money being there -- so i left. my father
    doesn''t believe in "doing nothing." if you''re not in school, you get a job.
    so for the past 14 months i have had a job to fill my day. i think i want to go
    back to school in august, but i also feel i''m doing it to please everyone else.
    honestly, i no longer know what i want to be in life. i have no idea what i want
    to major in. i''m just lost. i have never dated, done drugs, drunk, partied or
    anything else besides go to school. and i was good at it. i try not to look girlie
    or pretty because it attracts guys'' attention. but now i realize that no matter
    what you do, they''re going to notice you. i feel like my life has to change for
    the sake of my emotional health. i feel purposeless. i have dreams of what i want
    out of life -- a mansion, a nice car, money in the bank -- but i don''t necessarily
    have to go to college to achieve that. i know it sounds like a cliche, but i feel
    like i don''t know who i am. i can''t backpack through europe, nor do i have the
    money to even travel around the united states. so my question is, how should i
    go about finding myself? -- needs help in chicago'

    than a little miffed. i say that if the inviter knows both adult members of a

    with the one not invited, rather than make the one who was invited feel awkward.

    my late aunt isabel''s wit was legendary in our family. we come from a small town
    in connecticut where many roads are so narrow that if a car should stall, the
    car behind it would be unable to pass. this is what happened to my aunt one day.
    while she was trying to restart the engine, the driver in the car behind her began
    blowing his horn repeatedly. aunt isabel set the parking brake, got out of her
    car and walked over to the driver''s window. when he rolled it down, she smiled
    warmly and said, "i can''t seem to get my car started. would you be kind enough
    to start it for me? and i''ll stay here and blow your horn for you." -- joe p.,

    i am one of your many male readers. regarding "betrayed in the midwest" (dec.

    1: he''s an adult who had sex with a minor. in all states that i know of, this
    is a crime, reportable to child protective services and to the law, and it''s
    punishable. it amounts to statutory rape. reid is the guilty party here. lindy

    my sister, "elizabeth," died recently. she had adopted a baby at birth and insisted
    that the child not be told that she was adopted. the "child" is now in her 50s,
    and we think that for years she may have suspected that she was adopted because
    she''s different in appearance and temperament from other family members. on the
    off chance that she has siblings, would it be wise to inform her at this late
    date of her adoption? i think the reason elizabeth didn''t want her to know was
    that she was afraid of losing her daughter''s affections. i did not agree with
    that decision, but i honored it while my sister was alive. what are your thoughts

    we moved to a small (six-house) cul-de-sac last october, and a few weeks later
    we were outside raking leaves. two of our neighbors were outside as well, and
    no one introduced themselves or even waved. we left a very friendly subdivision
    and were hoping to find the same in our new neighborhood. we are just looking
    for a smile, and someone to watch our house if we''re out of town, etc. we''d

    would you have criticized that parent if the students were driving drunk? shoplifting?
    committing acts of vandalism? i think she should have reported them to the police
    as well as the school. that the other parents were upset because their children
    were punished administratively is one of the reasons that so many kids get into
    trouble today. their parents excuse the misdeed and fault the person who does
    take some positive action. certainly, i expect parents to stand by their kids
    when they''re in trouble, but being supportive does not mean excusing or covering
    up illegal behavior. students need to learn accountability for their misdeeds,
    and not expect parents to bail (no pun intended) them out of their wrongdoings.

    ted was married and suggested i date bridget. within a few days, before i got

    and started seeing bridget. this was awkward, but in addition, bridget started

    my husband and i are in our early 30s and we spend a lot of time with three other
    couples. a few months ago, we went on a picnic at a local park to play ball and
    have lunch. one man (i''ll call him bill) thought it was funny to pour what was
    left of a soft drink on one of the wives'' head. she and her husband had to leave.
    it was obvious she couldn''t stay with sticky hair and clothing. bill called them
    "party-poopers." three weeks ago, bill yanked the cloth off a table that had been
    set with another of the wives'' good dishes. broken china lay everywhere. that
    wife was also a "party-pooper" because she didn''t think it was funny. last weekend
    there was a pool party. i didn''t want to go because i''m not comfortable with
    the water. my husband promised he''d stay right with me, which he did. however,
    bill swam under the water, grabbed both my ankles and yanked me under. i was terrified.
    i told bill i never wanted to see him again, and i meant it. now his wife, "nicki,"
    is upset because she found out i had a dinner at my home and didn''t invite them.
    i told her she could come, but i would no longer let her husband near me. i think
    he needs professional help. nicki and i work in the same building, and i see her
    almost every day. we eat in the building cafeteria, and she''s spreading the word
    that i have caused trouble with their group of friends. she''s saying i made a
    play for her husband and he rejected me, and i''m angry about it. i have not said
    anything to defend myself. i don''t feel the need. but my husband says i should

    why doesn''t the woman he''s dating pitch in? she could bond with the kids by

    i have two rules for my business life. first, keep your personal life separate

    witnessed, on several occasions, my peers and managers drink at business functions.

    their careers. only once was i ever affected by this decision. i was passed over
    for a raise and promotion because i wouldn''t go out and drink with "the boys."
    my solution? i found a better job with a different company. i have been very successful
    with this company, holding various management positions. when i''m out at lunch

    i''m comfortable with it. noah also promised it would be "gradual." i took the
    kids to see his apartment a couple of days later. the next day he called me and
    announced he was taking them to a birthday party for one of dana''s relatives.
    he also said some co-workers would be there. (he and dana work for the same company.)
    we''re not even divorced yet! i don''t want to teach my kids that people live
    together before marriage. by moving in with dana, noah has created a secret i
    can''t tell my kids. abby, i had to meet many of my father''s girlfriends. they
    all fell by the wayside, each time creating more loss in my life. i don''t want
    that to happen to my children. i''m thinking of making a rule: one year of committed
    relationship before either noah or i introduce them to a potential partner. personally,
    i''m waiting until after the divorce is final before i start to date. am i right?

    i am a 33-year-old single mother with three children ages 11, 3 and 1. after escaping
    an unhealthy three-year relationship, i moved back in with my parents. i soon
    found a good job, and i have been paying my parents a substantial amount of rent
    every month. my problem is, after 11 months of living with my parents, i feel
    it''s time for me and my children to get a place of our own. mother keeps trying
    to talk me out of moving because she has become dependent on the money she receives
    from me every month. i don''t want to leave her in a bind, but i need my own space.

    i just finished reading your list of questions for "are you ready for parenthood?"
    (12/6). your advice was fine, if you were addressing a mature adult. to reach
    a 15-year-old, try this: "if your child throws up all over your bed, are you or
    the father going to clean it up, stay up all night with a crying child and then
    go to work the next day? when the baby is sick, will you cancel your plans with
    your friends and stay home? "will you skip buying clothes or the latest cell phone
    for yourself because you can barely afford food for your little one? are you willing
    to give up your dreams of school or travel because the child you gave birth to
    will grow up and need shoes, an education or medical care? are you prepared for
    when this cute, cuddly infant becomes a screaming 2-year-old? "if you continue
    your education, will you have the energy to work and care for a child who totally
    depends on you for all physical and emotional needs? and, most important of all,
    can you handle all this alone if suddenly the father decides he''s ''not ready''
    for the responsibility?" -- waited till i was old enough and glad of it!'

    a man, abby. i have lived as a woman since high school, and when i was 25, underwent
    surgery to change my sex. i have never regretted my decision and, up until now,
    my family has always been supportive. as i have always been a woman in every way
    that matters, i have never seen any reason to tell any man i''ve dated that i
    was born with male genitalia. my brother recently asked me if i had told marc
    about my surgery and was shocked to learn that i had not. he implored me to tell
    marc, but i feel that my past is completely irrelevant to our relationship today.
    my brother thinks that i am obligated to confess to marc, and he has threatened
    to tell him if i don''t. marc loves me very much and would support me no matter

    i have been in construction since i was 19. i''m 47 now. i want to know, what
    makes a man lose his courage? i started my own business two years ago, and since
    then i have been doing mostly interior work -- remodeling kitchens, bathrooms,
    hanging doors, etc. my most recent job is a second-story add-on, and while i have
    been working on it i have found myself nervous about heights. i have never been
    afraid of heights before, but i was uneasy walking the walls and working off a
    ladder. i have never felt like this before. it''s kind of embarrassing. my guys
    tease me, but i laugh it off. am i just getting older (which i don''t want to
    admit) or out of practice? i''m not losing sleep over this, just wondering why.

    my problem is unusual, but i''m hoping if you address it in your column it will
    help. i''m a married man, confident in who i am, who wears skirts for comfort.
    i feel skirts are more comfortable than pants, which i find tight, restrictive
    and uncomfortable. i wear skirts around the house, when i''m out running errands
    and when i attend church. my clergyman has raised no objection to it. after much
    research, my wife and i have concluded that the only thing against men wearing
    skirts is social pressure, and then only in certain countries -- america being
    one of them. pants are a relatively new style of clothing. for thousands of years
    of recorded history, men and women both wore skirts. then women fought for and
    won the right to wear pants, shorts, whatever they wanted -- which is great. i
    believe men should have the same option. my wife supports me in this. our problem
    is some family members who disagree have talked behind our backs, started rumors
    and turned people against us with false information. how can i make them understand
    that they are entitled to their belief, but that they shouldn''t gossip and create
    problems for us because i am not doing anything wrong? -- joe in pennsylvania'

    a friend of mine bought me a bathrobe. i had told her a while ago that my favorite

    liked, so i selected some kitchen utensils because i enjoy cooking and have cooked

    two years ago, a couple built a home on the lot next to ours. from the time they
    moved in, we have been concerned about their 11-year-old son''s anti-social behavior.
    it began with him trying to coax our dog into his yard when we were trying to
    call her in. then he started coming into our yard, playing roughly with our three
    small children and using vulgar language around our 8-year-old daughter. he is
    no longer allowed in our yard and has been kicked out of three other homes in
    the neighborhood. the most recent incident occurred a few days ago, when he yelled
    a profanity at our daughter. i called his mother, and she told me her son would
    "never behave that way"! abby, this boy is creepy. i don''t trust him. he stands
    in his yard staring at us whenever we are outside. i''m worried his behavior will

    my mother passed away 26 years ago. after her funeral, i gave her diamond engagement
    ring to my daughter, "emma." since then emma has had two husbands and two more
    diamond rings, plus several others with various gemstones to match outfits. as
    far as i know, she has never worn my mother''s ring. i would like to spend my
    last years honoring my mother by wearing her ring. i am now 82. it would, of course,
    be returned to emma when i die. would it be all right to ask for that privilege?

    i am happily married, but all my life i have yearned for a close and sisterly
    relationship with my mother and my sisters. we are very different people, but
    a kind and understanding female relative is what i have always wished for. they
    send me unsolicited advice, including articles about physical and mental health,
    diet pills and clippings on finances, etc., but we don''t seem to be able to sustain
    good conversation, with listening or encouragement. i sometimes think people get
    so wrapped up in trying to "fix" others that they don''t see the true beauty that
    lies within. i have expressed my feelings to them about wishing we could be closer,
    but was told that sisterly affection is a "myth." unfortunately, i don''t fit
    in with my husband''s family, either. family issues seem to be the recurring theme
    of my life. it''s depressing. i work full-time, do charity work and have good
    friends outside my family, but i still long for a closer relationship with my
    family. is there a way to let go of old dreams and wishes? with the holidays here,
    i have difficulty getting through this time without a bad case of the blues. --

    when i come home and my girlfriend is there, i greet her with a cheerful "hello"

    without giving me a greeting. i have tried explaining to her that her behavior
    makes me feel like she isn''t happy to see me. but when i tell her it hurts my

    i have begun dating a woman i find very attractive. i''ll call her "rita." we
    have many things in common, and she''s a lot of fun to be with. the only thing
    that troubles me is that after 12 years of being divorced, rita is still very
    much involved with her ex. most of their children are grown. one is a senior in
    high school, and an older child still lives at home. her ex is allowed free access
    to her home, mostly to see the kids -- and comes and goes at will. they travel
    together to family functions and to visit children who live in other parts of
    the state. rita recently had her hair styled differently and told me she was annoyed
    that her ex didn''t seem to notice. when he comes to her house to cook for the
    kids, he leaves the kitchen a mess, which she apparently cleans up. do you think

    i decided to ask him what his feelings were about our friendship and where he
    saw it going. keep in mind, vinny has no children, and i have two from a previous
    marriage. vinny told me he has developed feelings for me, too, but that he wants
    to have children of his own someday. i respect and understand his honesty. he

    too close to someone, he would pull away. that suggests to me that he is commitment-phobic.

    before he goes to bed -- although we have not been spending as much time together

    a little over a year ago, my sons -- ages 10 and 11 -- met a 10-year-old boy named
    "adam" and have played with him often since. during this time, adam''s mother
    and i have cultivated a warm friendship that i don''t want to lose. the problem?
    my sons don''t like to play with adam anymore. they say he cries and storms out
    when he doesn''t get his way. i have observed this behavior myself. his mom has
    commented on it to me, but doesn''t know what to do about it. how can i tell my
    good friend that my kids don''t want to play with her son anymore? can i tell
    her? my sons have "sucked it up" several times now so i could visit with her,
    but i don''t think it''s fair to keep asking them to do that. my boys get along
    nicely with their other friends and would rather play with them. is there any
    way to solve this? -- baffled in charlotte'

    my older sister, "iris," has suffered from depression for years, partly due to
    the success i have achieved in my life. i have traveled internationally, received
    scholarships, and now at 26, have a well-paying job and a loving husband. iris
    dropped out of college twice, works a minimum-wage job and has never had a boyfriend.
    i never brag about any of my achievements, but we talk on the phone often and
    she knows everything that''s going on in my life. my sister has never openly displayed
    any jealousy or resentment, but our mother has confided to me that iris has been
    taking antidepressants for years and feels that she has never accomplished anything
    "great." i have now learned that i''m expecting my first child. i''m afraid that
    when iris finds out, she may be devastated. how can i tell her without sending
    her into a deeper depression, and how can i enjoy the good things that happen
    to me without feeling guilty about my sister? -- guilty achiever in canada'

    i am a 33-year-old man who has never been in a serious relationship until now.
    i have been seeing "stephie" for eight months and think i may be in love with

    got away with it until recently. she keeps asking me about the scars on my body.
    (i was physically abused by my parents when i was a child.) regrettably, i lied
    to her about the nature of the scars. stephie wants to be married and start a
    family, and so do i. she wants her kids to have a great dad, and i think i can
    be a very good parent. i would never do to my kids what was done to me. on the

    if i tell her the truth she will leave me, and i''ll spiral into another five-year

    i''m not sure how to react to something a friend of mine recently told me. we
    have known "lois" and her husband for more than 30 years. they no longer live
    in this city, but visit occasionally. when they do, we always invite them to stay
    in our home. on their last visit, lois was talking about her only child, "deidre,"
    whom i have always liked. lois, out of the blue, began chuckling and then told
    me that deidre does a good imitation of me. lois sat there giggling for a few
    minutes, then said that deidre sounded almost as much like me as i do. i made
    no comment. frankly, i was taken aback that someone would do an imitation of me.
    i got the impression that deidre has been doing my "act" for a while, and i found
    it disturbing. my husband says it''s a form of flattery, but i think it''s demeaning.
    i also think impersonating someone for the amusement of others -- especially if

    whatever happened to the idea of keeping to the right? most drivers observe this
    rule in their cars, but as soon as their feet hit the pavement, all memory of
    it vanishes. our sidewalks, airports, grocery stores and shopping malls have become
    free-for-alls. i was taught in school that keeping to the right prevents accidents.
    people have crashed into me with their grocery carts as i made a right turn from
    one aisle to the next and they are making a left turn along the left side. then
    they look at me as if i''m in the wrong place. rules like this are designed to
    make life easier. it seems a growing number of people don''t realize this is common
    courtesy or just don''t care. i hope that by mentioning this in your column that
    it will remind people so our sidewalks, stores and malls will be safer for all
    who are walking. if people will remember to stay to the right and pass on the
    left, they will see that these important rules of the road make all traffic move

    your response surprised me. it isn''t normal behavior for a friend to steal a
    baby sitter or use you for any purpose. isn''t part of being a good friend that
    you trust one another? refusing to share resources with friends implies that other
    friends will do the same. the woman who used "feels like a fool" needs to get
    the message that her behavior is unacceptable. she lied when she said it would
    only be occasionally; she used her friend and took advantage of her trusting nature.

    i am a foreign exchange student studying in the u.s. other exchange students and
    i have been debating two questions. the first: is it ok to buy a movie ticket
    and watch two or three movies? some say "yes" because theaters tolerate it in
    the hope that customers will buy snacks and drinks in the process. others say
    it goes against the honor system. the second is: is it wrong to return merchandise
    you never intended to buy in the first place? example: to buy a novel and return
    it after reading it. my friends say bookstores expect a certain number of returns
    and build it into the cost of the books. as long as the book is kept in good condition,
    it''s ok. other friends stress, however, that this, again, is taking advantage

    don''t celebrate them. i am single. my parents died many years ago, and i have
    no family. my only surviving sibling and his wife are both alcoholics who drink
    to excess over the holidays and cause tension in their family. i have attended
    al-anon meetings, and because i refused to look the other way while they were
    drinking, i was cut off. co-workers take time off at christmas, but i take mine
    at other times of the year. over time, i have found that i would rather spend
    a so-called holiday catching up on correspondence, taking a walk, reading a good
    book or sewing. outside of work or professional organizations, i do not do anything
    about the year-end holidays. i understand the religious and historical significance
    of these celebrations and keep them in my heart, but do not observe them in a
    visible manner. this is my choice. when people ask me what i''m doing for the

    my first serious relationship lasted a year and ended more than eight years ago.
    "stacy" was terrific, but we were very different, and our relationship came to
    an amicable end. several months later, i heard that stacy had begun dating a close
    friend of mine, "alex," soon after our breakup. needless to say, i was devastated.
    alex''s betrayal was as painful or more so than that of stacy. i broke off all
    contact with them in an attempt to salvage my dignity. i haven''t spoken to either
    one since. all these years later, i am happily married to a wonderful woman. i
    hear through the grapevine occasionally that stacy and alex are still together.
    whenever i do, i feel unaccountably upset. it''s not that i''m pining for an old
    flame, because i wouldn''t trade my wife for any woman on earth. i have thought
    a lot about it and believe i am clinging to the naive belief -- or hope -- that
    people who do unkind, deceitful things always come to regret it in the end. i
    am grappling with the guilt of wishing unhappiness for two people who are obviously
    happy together. i can''t help it, but i know i''d be glad if i learned they''d

    some. then my older daughter said, "sorry," in a sarcastic tone, and my younger
    daughter responded with, "anybody mind if i take a shower now?" (my husband works
    third shift and helps me as much as he can.) i spent all that day loading and
    unloading the dishwasher, and putting things back where they belong. my daughters
    spent the day shopping, visiting friends and watching tv. i have spent my life
    trying to make holidays special for my daughters so they would have happy childhood

    i''m concerned about my 37-year-old brother, "ricky," who still lives at home
    with our mother. ricky is good-looking, never married and has never really had
    a girlfriend. our father passed away four years ago, and since then our mother
    has become dependent on ricky for everything. neither one has any friends outside
    the family. i try to get my brother to come out and meet people and have some
    fun, but he generally declines. if he does agree to come, mother comes with him.
    please don''t get me wrong. we all love and support her in every way, but this
    situation is unhealthy and weird. they almost act like a married couple. please
    help. what should i do? -- desperate sis in illinois'

    i turned 21 two months ago. i''m not usually one to get all excited about my "special
    day," but my boyfriend, "skip," insisted on making a big deal out of it. when
    the day arrived, we agreed to use a gift certificate my brother had given us to
    use as a "thank you" for something else. i didn''t mind. but when the waiter brought
    the check for the remainder of the cost of the dinner, skip "realized" he had
    "forgotten" his wallet, so i had to pay. when we got home, skip said he was going
    to pick up a friend to join us for cake. after two hours waiting for him to return,
    i finally called him to come back. to top it off, he didn''t even give me a birthday
    card because he is saving up to buy a car. i know birthdays aren''t about material
    things, but about being around people you love. but skip built up my expectations
    then totally shot me down. am i wrong for still feeling hurt? -- depressed in

    came to visit. she loved the town so much she decided to move here and be my roommate.

    out that lindsay is very promiscuous. since january she has had sex with seven
    men, sometimes dating more than one at a time. i worry about her because this

    reputation, not to mention my uneasiness about waking up and finding strange men
    in my apartment -- some of whom she met only the night before. i think she is
    compromising both of our safety. how can i handle this tactfully? lindsay is an

    my wife and i received an invitation from a family member to attend their daughter
    "heidi''s" wedding on father''s day weekend. we canceled our existing plans in
    order to attend, and gave "heidi and dave" an appropriate gift. as the ceremony
    progressed, the minister asked, "do you, steve, take heidi" ... at which point
    the guests began whispering to themselves, "steve?" we were embarrassed, thinking
    we had made a horrible mistake in addressing the gift card -- and we weren''t
    the only ones. finally, after much discussion among the guests, someone approached
    the bride''s mother to ask if we had made a mistake. "oh, no," she replied. "dave
    backed out two weeks ago. heidi asked steve if he would marry her, and he said
    he wasn''t doing anything else this weekend, so why not?" i was flabbergasted.
    predictably, in less than three weeks, this sham of a marriage was over. heidi,
    of course, retained all the gifts. my wife says it''s no big deal. i say the bride''s
    parents should have called the guests and explained the circumstances so they
    could make an informed decision about attending. i was also raised to believe
    that in cases such as this, where the commitment to marriage was so obviously
    missing, that the gifts should be returned. am i wrong? this has caused a rift

    my friend "tracy" has been hinting that she needs to borrow money. i don''t loan
    money to people unless it''s an emergency, and frankly, i know if i lend her any,
    she won''t pay me back. last week she took her family on vacation and to her uncle''s
    funeral. when they got back, she went on and on about all the fun they had and
    mentioned that she had spent almost $1,000. she then followed it up with, "so,
    next month i may need to borrow money from you. does your offer still stand?"
    abby, i never offered to loan her money! i quickly changed the subject because
    i didn''t want to say anything i might regret later. how do i tell her i don''t
    want to loan her money without losing a friendship or hurting her feelings? --

    i''m a 13-year-old girl in eighth grade. ever since fifth grade i have had a crush
    on a teacher, "mr. m." he was my homeroom teacher in fifth grade, and i just kind
    of "fell in love" with him. mr. m. is 40 and has two children. abby, i know it
    is wrong, but for some reason, i have been obsessed with him. ever since i was
    10 i have been his favorite student, and obviously he was my favorite teacher.

    i read about your booklet "how to write letters for all occasions" a few years
    ago, and i want to let you know how much it helped me recently in writing to my
    aunt. you see, my aunt''s beloved cat, "mouser," passed away. although i didn''t
    know mouser very well, i did know how much her cat meant to her. knowing how much
    she was hurting, i felt i had to say something -- but what? then i remembered
    that your booklet had a section on how to write a condolence letter. you said:
    "when writing a condolence letter ... if you come up with a specific memory that
    you have cherished, relate it. believe it or not, a humorous incident will be
    appreciated." so i sent my aunt a funny incident i remembered about mouser. she
    wrote me back a month later thanking me for "moving her thoughts from a very sad
    place and making her smile." she said my story made her remember other antics
    she hadn''t thought of in a long time. i know i''m not the only person who has
    trouble putting feelings down on paper. please mention your booklet again so your
    readers will know this invaluable resource is available. -- grateful reader in

    i am 43, and my boyfriend, "sid," is 52. we have been together a year and a half.
    i was married once, and sid has been married three times. he wants to live together,

    other and communicate very well. because of a previous rebound marriage that lasted
    only a year, sid is cautious about making another mistake. after we had been together
    for a year, i gave him a year to make up his mind about marriage. in the months
    that followed, i could tell from some of the remarks he made that he had no burning
    desire to be married any time soon. after five months of listening to those statements,

    my beautiful 9-month-old daughter, "lyric," is the result of an affair. her father,
    "james," has never seen her, except in photographs. his family has no idea she
    exists. when i send pictures, he promises to visit "soon" -- but i''m not supposed
    to ask when because he "just doesn''t know right now." i feel it''s my fault lyric
    is growing up without a father. my parents dote on her, and they are furious that
    james promised to make sure we were taken care of but hasn''t followed through
    "for financial reasons." i have never taken him to court for child support (james
    does send a little) because i''m afraid if i do, he''ll never come to see lyric.
    i worry about her future because my dad was estranged from us when we were little,
    and his absence influenced some of the worst choices i have made in my life. why
    would james promise to visit but never make the effort? why continue the charade?
    i''m afraid my daughter will blame me for not having a dad when she''s older.
    i have considered taking her to see james unexpectedly (he and his wife are currently
    separated) so i can tell her i did everything in my power to get him involved.
    my parents say i should be happy i don''t have to share her, and not to take her
    because he has broken so many promises to me. i have been upset about this ever

    i work for a small, family-owned business. the owner has strong political views
    and insists on listening to a political talk show during the afternoon, with the
    volume turned up quite loud. my boss assumes that his views are everyone else''s
    and talks to customers as if his opinion is gospel. i have watched them roll their
    eyes and try to get away. i have worked here for three years, and i can''t take
    it anymore. my co-workers say i can''t say anything because he owns the business,
    and he can do whatever he wants. i have looked for another job, but this is a
    small town and jobs are scarce. i think it''s inappropriate to force one''s political

    may i pass on some information that may be helpful to your readers? i work at
    a mail-processing center. some people use the self-addressed envelopes sent to
    them by businesses and organizations for other purposes. these envelopes have
    bar codes on them. when people recycle them, they cross out the organization''s
    name and address but forget to cross out the bar code. therefore, the envelope
    gets sent to the business that provided it, rather than to the party to whom it
    has been readdressed. sometimes this happens even after the bar code has been
    blackened out. we have received tax payments, personal letters, credit card payments
    -- you name it. we do return this mail to the post office, but i am sure it takes
    a while for it to get to the correct address. i feel bad for people having to
    endure the delay this causes. my advice: if you must use these envelopes, please
    make sure you completely cover up or black out the original bar code. -- trying

    i am in my 70s, on social security and in my second marriage. my wife, "irene,"
    is in her early 50s and holds a good job. she also holds the purse strings, and

    irene has given me a gas credit card so i can get around. last week, i told her
    that i need some underwear and asked her for her store credit card. she said she
    has a drawer full of nylon panties and that i should wear them instead. she said

    yesterday i ordered a taco salad and an iced tea at a popular fast food restaurant.
    i sat down and proceeded to eat when i noticed a couple sitting on one side of
    a table. neither of them was skinny. another couple joined them, and the women
    began staring at me. i am 55 years old and 250 pounds. they were over 35 and plus-sized

    i have tried to talk her out of it, but as the years have progressed, i realize

    their oldest was born while my parents were still legally married. my mother never
    wanted a divorce. she gave him one reluctantly when she knew all was lost, but
    she never got over it. although mom never said an unkind word about my father,
    she was never the same woman. basically, she devoted her life to my brother and
    me, her home and her full-time job. she died last year after a brief illness,
    and my father didn''t even attend the funeral. two weeks ago, i received a long
    letter from one of dad and sheila''s kids. in it she told me that she had nothing
    to do with what happened, so couldn''t we get to know one another? she extended
    an open invitation to lunch or dinner. the thought of getting close to the offspring
    of the woman who broke up my parents'' marriage and caused my mother so much pain
    is surreal. abby, what do you think i should do? -- disconcerted in new york'

    my boyfriend, "george," and i have been living together about five years. we both
    have children from previous relationships. my daughter is 11; george''s daughter,
    "sophie," is 8. she doesn''t live with us, but george has her every other weekend.
    i''m sad to say that after all these years, i hardly know sophie. most of george''s
    weekends with her are spent at his mother''s lakefront cottage. this hurts my
    feelings. i have told george numerous times that i would like to be more involved
    in his daughter''s life. we plan on being married someday, which would make me
    sophie''s stepmother. george tells me that because he doesn''t see sophie that

    i was a lonely widow for many years until i met "carl." we married two years ago,
    but separated after two weeks. afterward, my daughter, "gail," and her husband,
    "don," and their two kids lived with me for 18 months. i was the only one working.
    gail helped a little around the house, but don wouldn''t even mow the grass. during
    that time i had two heart attacks and an angioplasty. two weeks before my first
    heart attack, gail and i had a terrible fight, and the police were called. when
    carl heard about the heart attack (i sent him a copy of the bill), he called to
    check on me. don told him it was "nothing." he said i made it all up, and i was
    "fine." my doctor said if i hadn''t come in during the second heart attack and
    had the angioplasty, i would not have survived. a month after the angioplasty,
    gail, don and i had another terrible fight. gail punched me several times, and
    i hit her back at least twice. the police made them move out that same night.
    i don''t regret them leaving. they acted like my house belonged to them and i
    was their slave. i do miss my grandchildren, though. carl and i have reconciled,
    and now we realize that don went out of his way to create problems between us.
    i have not spoken to him or my daughter since. my sons, my friends and my neighbors
    have all told me they are relieved the two of them are gone. what is your opinion

    but when i would see my child and the offending friend back together the next
    day, i learned to hold my tongue. most recently, a man ran a stop sign, rammed

    companies have of homemakers. when asked if i was losing time at work, i answered

    my 22-year-old daughter was driving on a busy street when she noticed an older
    gentleman in running shorts lying on the median. she stopped, turned on her hazard
    lights and went to help. he was unresponsive, but breathing. when she called 911,
    she was told that more than 100 motorists had reported a "dead man" on the street,
    but no one had stopped to check on him. police, an ambulance and a fire truck
    arrived shortly after her call. abby, at what point do we become invisible? when
    do we cease to be important? would it have been different if that person had been
    a child or someone in his 30s? have we lost our humanity? -- disappointed in tampa'

    i wrote your mother back in 1985, asking her to encourage my eighth-grade students

    been 23 years since your mother wrote my students about the importance of reading.
    today we have computers, text messaging and cell phones. it''s a different world
    now, but reading is still important. would you write a couple of paragraphs about
    the joys of reading in your column? your advice will be heeded by my students

    nine years ago i had reconstructive facial surgery to repair a botched nose job.

    fine with it, but my mother and brother have a hard time looking at and socializing
    with me. over the past nine years some hurtful things have happened. i was in
    church one sunday and overheard my brother say laughingly, "i can''t believe how
    she looks." mom told him, "you''d better contain yourself." once, when my sister-in-law
    was holding her year-old daughter, i was smiling and talking to the baby. my sister-in-law
    said to her, "you don''t even know what you''re looking at, do you?" abby, sometimes
    i catch my mother shaking her head in disbelief over my appearance. i asked my

    person with a great attitude. she married an intelligent, confident man who has
    become successful and has always been crazy about her. she lives in a beautiful
    home and has never had to work. she has a close and loving family who travels
    all over the world together, celebrating every occasion. when she finishes telling
    me about her wonderful life, she then asks about mine. but, abby, i just can''t
    bring myself to tell her about my boring job, my unsuccessful husband, my parents

    my uncle remarried a few years ago to an interior decorator i''ll call "fern."
    i asked her about getting some drapes made, and she came over and spent a couple
    of hours discussing styles, colors, trims and fabrics. i had my eye on some curtains
    that cost about $30 a pair, so i was shocked when fern gave me an estimate of
    $12,000. (and that included my "family discount"!) needless to say, i didn''t
    get the drapes. last week -– a year and a half later -– i received a bill for
    $200. fern enclosed a note with the bill saying she had thought i was still undecided
    about the drapes, but now that she realizes i''m not purchasing them, she should
    be compensated for her time. i feel i should have been told in advance that i''d
    be charged for the consultation, but she never mentioned it. what should i do?

    i was a little disappointed in your reply to "m.h. in l.a." (june 22) regarding
    roadside memorials. i know you feel they are a gesture of respect, but really,
    there''s a time and place for everything. memorials belong in cemeteries, not
    on our roadways. my dear father was run over by a truck and killed. i would never
    dream of putting up a cross as a reminder of the place where he died. that was
    done at the cemetery the day we laid him to rest. we need to celebrate life, not
    death. by creating roadside memorials we solidify the place of death, not the
    life the individual had. also, the memorial becomes a constant reminder to first
    responders who must pass by that place every day. i have worked with a crisis
    response team in my county and was told by a 19-year-old firefighter who couldn''t
    sleep that it was because of the body parts they had to pick up from the roadway.
    why have visual reminders on the road to remind everyone of the worst day instead

    i love dogs, but they''re ruining my marriage. "ivan" and i have been together
    12 years, married for five. six years ago, he had to put his aged, sickly pointer,
    "sergeant," to sleep. two years ago, i began suggesting that we get another dog.
    i felt ivan had mourned sergeant long enough, and it was time for another. we
    found a lovely king charles spaniel that we named lili. we spent a lot of fun
    time with her that spring and summer, then thought a playmate might be good company
    for her during the day while we were at work. we found branford, another spaniel.
    at night we''d put both dogs in the kitchen, tell them goodnight, put up a gate
    and go to bed. but branford would cry. i told ivan he''d stop eventually, but
    ivan couldn''t just leave him, so he began bringing the two dogs into our bedroom
    and allowing them to sleep at the foot of our bed. i have pleaded with ivan to
    return them downstairs, but he won''t consider it. guess where they''re sleeping
    today? in the bed. guess where i''m sleeping? on the couch downstairs. we haven''t
    been out on a date since the dogs arrived. we don''t go out with friends because
    we must be back by 10 p.m. -- the dogs'' bedtime, and ivan''s, too, of course.
    he is oblivious to me from the time he goes to bed with the dogs. we haven''t
    had sex in a year. everything is about the dogs. he even prepares their meals
    from scratch each day -- boiled chicken with rice, peas and carrots. he says:

    i''m a 23-year-old female and what you would call a "serial monogamist." i don''t
    understand how i got this way, but i just love being in a relationship. my curse
    is that i constantly wish to be back with my exes. i idealize the past and "forget"
    the negative things that made me cheat on or leave them. i know that if i leave
    my current boyfriend, i''ll just want to get back with him in the future. it''s

    i have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend, "elli," for two
    years. we haven''t seen each other for almost six months, and now she has decided
    she wants time apart. our relationship was suffering during my last year of graduate
    school because i wasn''t able to give elli the time she deserved. now i have graduated
    and have a job that gives me more time to dedicate to her. she decided when i
    relocated that she would not move to the city with me. she says she wants to keep
    me in her life, but she "needs space" to find herself. we schedule chats on the
    phone and try to avoid discussing the status of our relationship, but we usually
    end up arguing and crying. i suggested visiting her now that i can afford to,
    so we can talk through our differences in person, but elli says it would be too
    much for her to bear. she says she loves me and that she''s doing this for the
    good of both of us. i miss her terribly. i think about her constantly, but i don''t
    want to smother her and have her resent me. is there more going on here than meets

    i am writing about a change i have seen in church. i accept the loud guitar music
    and informal settings, although i do miss the traditional hymns and formal altars.
    what i cannot get used to is the forced "friendly" greeting and handshaking. i
    attend church to meditate and worship with my family. i do not go to shake hands
    with strangers and give them a greeting dictated by a pastor. i like people. i
    am naturally caring, outgoing and friendly. however, i believe that a greeting
    or handshake should come from my own heart. i have mentioned this to friends and
    family from all faiths, ages and walks of life. none of them like this scheduled
    "greeting" either. many say they head for the restroom at that time, turn their
    backs or just shake hands with the people they came with, come to church late
    to avoid it, or don''t come at all. others feel the practice is unsanitary. i
    suggest that church leaders take an anonymous poll and ask how many in their congregations
    agree with me. what do you think, abby? -- minister''s daughter, cayucos, calif.'

    may i respond to the letter from "needs to know now in virginia" (aug. 4)? i,
    too, spent time behind bars -- 14 months. my soon-to-be ex sent me a card on our
    20th anniversary, a month after i was incarcerated, promising he''d be there for
    me when i got out. after months of denying there was anyone else, i finally found
    out the truth. she was not only accepted by his family, but also my kids. when
    i fell into a deep depression and tried to commit suicide, my husband told everyone
    it was just an act. that was 11 months ago. today i believe everything happens
    for a reason, because during most of our marriage my husband had tried to control
    me and verbally abused me. he''d tell me i was a horrible mother and wife, that
    my own family hated me and i had no friends. after a while, i started to believe
    him and had little or no self-esteem. while incarcerated, i took classes and learned
    that verbal abuse is as bad, if not worse, than physical. the scars heal, but
    the words kept playing over and over like a tape in my head. one thing i learned
    in the classes is you can''t change someone else; you can only change yourself.
    to this day he continues to verbally abuse me. last week he said he hopes i have
    cancer and die. but the words don''t hurt anymore. the only hurt i suffer is that
    he has convinced our children that i was a bad mother, so they no longer speak
    to me. they have welcomed her into their lives. i have learned to accept that
    my children want nothing to do with me, but pray that someday they will return
    to my life. i have met a caring man who knows all about my past and loves me for
    who i am. i am now grateful to the other woman. she saved me from a miserable
    marriage, and i know one day he''ll do to her what he did to me. so, my advice
    to "needs to know" is to run away as fast as she can because the man she''s involved
    with is no man. a real man would stand by his wife for better and for worse. --

    due to medical problems, i have a large raised scar on my chest. as a teen i used
    to be really self-conscious about it, but i decided that practically wearing a
    habit to cover it up is not fair to me. i get lots of stares, which i don''t mind
    so much when it is a child. one little girl came over, touched it, and asked her
    mother what it was. it made me smile. my problem is with teenagers and adults.

    month ago. nick has been down on his luck personally and financially for several
    years. he called and asked if he could bring "hattie" to our home for dinner.
    we agreed, hoping it would be a good relationship for him. within 15 minutes of

    disorder. she has two small children, but when i asked where they were, she changed
    the subject. nick doesn''t have kids, and he''s nearly 50. when hattie asked me
    for something to drink, i offered her tea or soda. she took the soda, then said
    she preferred beer and wine, and did i have any. i poured her a glass, then she
    asked for a second and proceeded to drink 2 1/2 bottles of wine. later, she told
    me she had a "headache" and asked if i had anything for pain. i offered tylenol.
    no, she wanted something with a "kick." needless to say, they didn''t stay long

    what do you think of marriages where the husband and wife merely tolerate each
    other and have little emotional connection? in our situation, my wife seems to
    accept that our marriage "just is," but i feel that marriage should offer more.
    i would press for a divorce except for the fear of making matters worse. in this
    case, no children are involved. it''s doubtful that counseling would change a

    how do you deal with a hypochondriac? my brothers and i lost our dear mother to
    cancer when we were in our teens. daddy has recently been diagnosed with a pernicious
    form of melanoma, which has a low survival rate. our father has been married to
    his second wife, "doris," for 20 years. doris is a textbook hypochondriac. she
    denies it, of course, and insists that her health is bad. so bad, in fact, that
    she didn''t see the irony of telling my sister-in-law, who was undergoing chemotherapy
    for lymphoma, that "no one understands what it''s like to live with a chronic
    condition." doris was referring to her allergies! now daddy is battling cancer.
    he and doris came to visit his three children and multiple grandchildren. doris
    talked about her head cold the entire visit, and our time with daddy was cut short
    because she needed to be driven back to the hotel. (no one else could detect her
    symptoms.) i''m sure doris loves my father, and after 20 years of marriage, they''re
    certainly used to each other. but now that daddy is facing death, i''m having
    trouble supporting doris'' emotional needs because her hypochondria is so irritating.
    still, dad wouldn''t want us to abandon his second wife, despite her psychosomatic

    my women friends have all known each other more than 25 years. one of our group,
    "dottie," (age 76) was a very astute businesswoman when she worked with us years
    ago before we all retired. about three years ago, dottie began behaving oddly.
    she couldn''t remember what she ordered at lunch in a restaurant and lied to us
    about bizarre things. (she claimed her doctor made a house call in the middle
    of the night and gave her an iv.) she also became argumentative. recently she
    has withdrawn from our group dates. now she no longer answers her phone and, on
    the rare occasion that one of us has gotten hold of her and offered to come over,
    she refused to answer the door. dottie is quite wealthy. she likes to drink at
    her neighborhood bar every night, and once when one of us called, we heard a man
    in the background saying, "that''s enough. hang up now," which she did. we''re
    concerned because dottie has no family, and there''s no one to contact. we''re
    worried about her. what options do we have? is there anyone we can contact in

    would gladly give to my lady if she''d keep it in the safe deposit box where it

    can i use in lieu of an engagement ring? i''d rather give her an annuity or something

    i''m afraid my best friend''s daughter, "kami," may have munchausen syndrome.

    kami is 30, a former nurse, and married with a toddler. she lives to be sick.
    she is always in the emergency room for something. kami often claims she has cancer
    and is dying. in fact, she recently told me proudly that she had "died" twice.
    ladies from her church clean her house and bring her meals because they think
    she''s at death''s door, yet kami and her husband are planning a water-skiing
    and snorkeling vacation. kami''s husband and parents are extremely protective
    of her and become defensive if anyone suggests that kami may not really be physically
    ill. a sister-in-law who mentioned munchausen is no longer spoken to. the final
    straw for me came when she arrived late to a wedding, making the grand entrance
    in a wheelchair, and by the end of the night was on her feet swing dancing at

    i am a high school teacher who has been encountering some problems with my students.
    i admit my personality is rather bland. my favorite flavor of ice cream is vanilla;
    my favorite color is beige -- you get the picture. i am also aware that i speak
    in a monotone. my students won''t let me hear the end of it. i know i should enforce
    discipline, but i don''t seem to have any control over my students. they blatantly
    ridicule my clothing and my voice. sometimes i even feel bullied. i try to ignore
    it, but it doesn''t seem to end. the entire class participates and finds it hilarious.
    what can i do to control my students? -- trying hard in tennessee'

    i am a 23-year-old gay man. five years ago, when i was 18, i became involved with
    "jeff," an older married man. my mother worked second shift in a hospital, so
    i was almost always alone after school. jeff would spend an hour or two with me
    three times a week while i was in high school, and spent more time in my apartment
    when i was in college. he also contributed $6,000 toward my college education.
    now that i have graduated and am working, jeff has offered me $20,000 as a down
    payment on a house three doors down from his. he says it''s a gift, not a loan.
    i know there would be no legal obligation to repay him. i love jeff, but in five
    years, when his youngest child is in college, if he doesn''t leave his wife, i''ll
    be ready to move on. would i be ethically obligated to repay him if i left? jeff
    is a very successful businessman. he can well afford to send all five of his children
    to college, even after having given me this gift. he has told me repeatedly that
    the last five years with me have been the best years of his life. if i spend another
    five years with him, he will have had the best 10 years of his life for a $26,000
    investment (or about $50 a week). am i being selfish or smart? -- closeted in

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my husband and i recently retired from teaching at a highly rated, competitive
    midwestern public school. cheating was rampant, from copying homework to text-messaging
    during tests in the classroom. when confronted, the cheaters were surprised and
    usually asserted that "everyone else does it." and they were right. cheating occurs
    in the classroom, in sports, in extra-curricular activities and in the hallways,
    and has become more acceptable among students than ever before. teachers are practically
    powerless to control it; administrators seem to have no idea how to handle it.
    parents don''t want to get involved for fear of angering their children, and a
    strong leader may be "asked" to back down from pursuing it. my husband and i tried
    many times to make students understand that what they were doing or thinking was
    wrong and needed to be corrected, only to be met with an incredulous stare, a
    sneer perhaps, and then, "can i go now?" we began asking ourselves that same question
    and realized last year that we "could go now" -- and we did. more of our time
    was spent trying to teach moral values and ethics and less was spent on the required
    curriculum. you were right when you said people''s codes of ethics have taken
    a nosedive in the last decade. it''s rampant in every aspect of life as you mentioned.
    but when it''s rampant in our schools, it eliminates any chance of fixing it for
    coming generations. -- retired in the midwest'

    the urge was so strong it scared me, so i took my razors and threw them away.

    nine months ago, my wife, "marie," left to go shopping and never came back. she
    took off leaving me and our three sons, ages 12, 14 and 16, without a word. we
    had been married 25 years. we had no contact for the first three months, and she
    has not helped support the kids in any way. she told no one -- including her family
    -- that she had left. friends would see me in public and ask where she was. marie
    has recently started talking about coming home, but i have mixed feelings. i asked
    why she left. she said she was unhappy and tired of living a lie. what lie? marie
    refuses to elaborate. two of our sons don''t want her back. they felt abandoned
    when she disappeared. my other son says he doesn''t care whether she comes back
    or not as long as she leaves him alone. i keep remembering the quote, "a house
    divided cannot stand," and i wonder about us. please advise me. -- lost in the

    my son-in-law, "tony," is very ill and probably won''t make it. it is a terrible
    tragedy for our family. he will leave behind a bereft wife and children. during
    his last crisis i traveled across country to support my daughter, "janet." my
    husband, "doug," isn''t janet''s father, and now he says he doesn''t want me going
    to the funeral. he says i have spent enough time on tony, and my visit was a "waste
    of money." he says janet wanting me there is a ploy -- that she''s "playing me."
    granted, she had some hard feelings when i divorced her father and married doug,
    but we have made up. i feel i need to be at the funeral to support her. there
    has been no love lost between janet and doug. he does not get along with his own
    kids from a previous marriage either. but should this interfere with my attending
    the funeral? doug says my going would be a betrayal to him and has threatened
    divorce if i go. how should i handle this? -- torn in des moines'

    at 17, i learned i could never have children. i was devastated. i thought there
    would never be a "happily ever after" for me. i was wrong. i have been happily
    married to a wonderful man for four years. i was honest with him about my infertility,
    and it made no difference to him. the problem is my father-in-law. although my
    husband has two sisters, he is the only son of an only son, and his dad is always
    pushing the baby issue. he says things like, "if i could only have a grandson
    before i die," or, "when are you going to get busy and have me a baby?" when i
    remind him that he has a grandson, he says it doesn''t matter. he wants one with
    his last name. my husband thinks i should just tell his father the truth -- that
    i can''t have children -- but i''m afraid his parents will hate me. it has been
    seven years since i learned i can''t have children, and i still feel an emptiness
    inside. and just when i think i can''t feel any worse, my father-in-law''s comments

    my husband, "fred," has never been much of a conversationalist, and since he stopped
    smoking five months ago, his weight has ballooned. we''re both elderly and live
    on a lake, so we''re quite isolated, especially during the long winters. although
    fred sees his doctor regularly, he''s stubborn and i doubt that he has told his
    doctor everything, including the possibility that he''s experiencing depression.
    he sits by the hour and pouts. this morning, when i tried to carry on a conversation,
    he refused to look at me. finally, i said, "do you want me to stop talking to
    you?" to which he replied, "do whatever you want." fred has never been easy to
    get along with, but his pouting is driving me crazy. i go out for lunch with friends

    my half-brother, "jace," and i had a complicated childhood. my father had an explosive
    temper and a disdain for children in general. he was abusive, and our mentally
    ill mother was absent during his rages. i had my share of abuse, but it was nothing
    compared to how jace was treated. his biological father lived in another state
    and rarely made contact, and my father never formally adopted him. it left jace
    with profound feelings of abandonment. my parents are finally divorced now. afterward,
    dad''s behavior toward me changed dramatically. he''s no longer abusive and is
    even fun to be around. however, he still maintains a palpable distance from jace.
    jace is an exceptional person with an outgoing personality and a zest for life.
    he has two beautiful children and one more on the way. dad has seen the oldest
    only once, and that was after i begged him for months to visit. it saddens me,
    and i end up overcompensating by spoiling jace''s kids with gifts, even though
