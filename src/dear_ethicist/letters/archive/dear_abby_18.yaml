    i read your column often and have recently been especially interested in your
    letters concerning manners. i am a 22-year-old, old-fashioned man in dallas. i
    enjoy opening doors, pulling out chairs, offering a hand in and out of cars, and
    all the other small but significant signs of respect. my problem is, it''s difficult
    to find women my age who are receptive to what i consider common courtesy. i can''t
    tell you how many times i''ve been snapped at with, "i can open my own doors!"
    or, "i can get out of the car by myself!" my all-time favorite occurred recently
    in a nice restaurant as i stood up when my dinner partner would leave the table.
    with a bewildered and condescending look, she said, "do you have to stand up every
    time i do?" it seems as though, in my generation at least, being considerate and
    showing respect for a woman is considered a sign of disrespect. i have read with
    interest how many of your readers appreciate well-mannered men; unfortunately,
    and i mean no disrespect to your readers, i haven''t seen a single letter from
    someone close to my age. i am beginning to believe that it''s better to be rude
    and inconsiderate on dates. however, i have no intention of changing my ways.
    my standards are set and anything less would be embarrassing for me. are there
    any young women who appreciate "old-fashioned" manners? -- disillusioned in dallas'

    a division chaplain (colonel) in the army reserves, a part-time pastor in a small

    want to be married anymore. last summer he bought a red corvette, and recently

    i am knee-deep in a quandary. i have a 30-something-year-old friend who throws
    herself a girls-only birthday party every year. this soiree always takes place
    at a nice restaurant selected by the hostess, where guests are expected to pay
    for their own drinks and meals. the cost usually runs from $60 to $80 per person.
    in addition, each guest is expected to bring the "birthday girl" a gift. in years
    past, i have come up with excuses in order to get out of attending. this year
    i learned through the grapevine that i''m not the only one who is reluctant to
    go. with the economy being what it is, i cannot justify the expenditure of attending

    my mother is divorced and currently dating "scott," a golf pro. he lives with

    he was honest about the fact he was living with someone. alice is the woman scott
    left his wife for. they moved here together from another state. however, he told
    my mother his relationship with alice was essentially over and he was waiting
    for the "right time" to leave. according to scott, he owns no furniture or household
    appliances, and the truck he drives is in alice''s name. he says if he had any
    assets his ex-wife would claim them. he''s not even listed in our local phone
    book. my sisters and i see red flags and have warned mother. she ordered us to
    stay out of her life. mother believes if she holds out long enough, scott will
    leave alice and come running to her. she believes everything he says. this has
    caused a huge rift in our family. i know mother doesn''t want to be alone, but
    her desperate attempts to turn this "romance" into something lasting frighten

    and then returned to her -- but mother continues to see him. i don''t understand

    i have been retired from teaching for many years and would like to share a lesson
    i learned that stands out in my memory like no other. i was young, teaching math
    at the junior high school level. we had worked hard on a new concept all week
    and the students were very stressed. they were frowning, frustrated and carping
    at each other and me. wanting to stop the crankiness before it got out of hand,
    i asked the students in the room to take out two sheets of paper and list the
    names of the other students in the room, leaving space between each name. then
    i told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates
    and write it down. it took the remainder of the class period to finish the assignment.
    when the students handed me the papers and left, they seemed more relaxed. that
    weekend, i wrote the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper and listed
    what the students had said about that individual. on monday, i gave each student
    his or her list. before long, everyone was smiling. "really?" i heard one whisper.
    "i never knew that i meant anything to anyone." "i didn''t know anyone liked me
    that much!" the assignment was never mentioned again, but it didn''t matter, because
    the exercise had accomplished its purpose. the students felt better about themselves
    and each other. years later, i was asked to attend the funeral of one of those
    students, a promising young man even when i taught him in junior high school.
    i was deeply saddened by his untimely death in vietnam. the church was packed
    with "mark''s" friends, many of whom had been his classmates and students of mine.
    after the funeral, i and many of mark''s former classmates were invited to his
    parents'' house. they approached me and said, "we want to show you something.
    mark was carrying this when he was killed." his father pulled something from a
    wallet. it was the list of all the good things mark''s classmates had said about
    him. "thank you so much for doing that," mark''s mother said. "as you can see,
    mark treasured it." a group of mark''s classmates overheard the exchange. one
    smiled sheepishly and said, "i still have my list. it''s in my diary." "i put
    mine in our wedding album," said another. "i bet we all saved them," said someone
    else. "i carry mine with me at all times." that''s when i finally cried. the lesson
    my former students taught me that day became a standard in every class i taught
    for the rest of my career. -- sister h.p.m., st. paul, minn.'

    couples have to give up a lot (albeit willingly) when their children are born.
    sneaking a few private moments in the shower while their little ones are asleep
    or behind a security gate is neither neglectful nor unsafe. why? baby monitors!

    national fire protection association president john m. buckman iii urged families
    to change the batteries in their smoke alarms when changing their clocks back
    to standard time. i recently installed two smoke alarms in my home with the help
    of an elderly gentleman friend. when the job was done, i pushed the test button
    and the sound nearly knocked me off my feet. my friend didn''t bat an eye. when
    i asked him if he had heard it, his response was, "heard what?" i asked him to
    put his ear next to the alarm and pushed the button again with the same result.
    i knew he couldn''t hear high-pitched sounds like the singing of birds, but the
    alarm sound was so sharp and intrusive i couldn''t believe he didn''t hear it.
    i called the 800-number listed on the brochure and was told the alarms are manufactured
    with only one pitch! are people afflicted with this condition expected to remain
    at risk should fire erupt in their home because no one makes an alarm attuned
    to their disability? it would seem like a simple adjustment to make alarms with
    a lower pitch audible to everyone. mr. buckman asked you to remind readers about
    the importance of maintaining working smoke alarms. i would like to remind him
    about how important it is they work for everyone, including people with hearing
    impairments. now that i''ve sounded my alarm, i hope it is heard by those who
    can respond to it. -- concerned reader, newport, vt.'

    we''ve all heard the statement, "friends don''t let friends drive drunk." my question
    is this: to what extent should a friend go in order to prevent someone from driving
    drunk? i am a 6-foot guy who is in good shape. i''m sure i could prevent anyone
    from getting behind the wheel, but let''s just say it could get ugly. with all
    the danger and devastation that could result from drunk drivers, is it reasonable
    to use physical force to stop them -- or should one''s protests end at a verbal

    my wife recently had her yearly mammogram and we are grateful it came out ok.
    i asked my wife if she continues to check her breasts between the mammograms.
    her response was yes, but that she wasn''t quite sure what to look for. her physician
    told her, "you will know it when you find it." i am not sure this was a clear
    enough answer. why don''t doctors have on hand one synthetic breast with a lump
    and one without to enable the patient to know exactly what she is looking for?
    in my opinion, it would be a good idea for men also to be taught what to look
    for in the male breast. i could suggest this to the medical profession, but i

    you printed a letter concerning the cruelty of abandoning pets. the following

    black-and-white fuzzy puppy that grew into a big, shaggy mess. i''m sorry to say
    the poor dog was taken into the country and dumped by the side of the road. our
    little niece loved that dog and mourned for her "bootsie" for some time. several
    months later, my sister-in-law overheard her daughter on the front porch asking
    excitedly, "bootsie! where have you been all this time?" yes, it took a few months,
    but bootsie found his way back home. i like to think my sister-in-law and her
    husband learned their lesson. the kindest thing you can do for a pet you can no
    longer keep is to take it to your local humane society or animal shelter. in this
    case, bootsie beat the odds -- many pets don''t. dumping an animal at the side

    my husband and i separated three years ago, right after the birth of our second

    we are now divorced. abby, he never comes around to see the girls. he won''t even

    seem to mind. in fact, he says he''s proud to be part of their lives, and has
    talked to me more than once about becoming a permanent part of all our lives.
    anthony is divorced with two children of his own. would it be inappropriate for

    one of the perks of my job is receiving free or discounted meals at local restaurants.
    last week i was invited to dine at one of the best restaurants in town. i thought

    the meal with me. i warned her that we would probably be expected to pay for part
    of the dinner. she said that would be fine. halfway through the meal, our server
    informed us that we would be expected to pay 50 percent of the bill. tess told
    me she had forgotten her wallet, and asked if i''d pick up the tab. she promised
    to pay me back, so i agreed. then she said she could afford to pay me only $1
    from each future paycheck, and asked if it was all right for her to order a $10
    dessert as well. abby, i was so shocked i could hardly respond. at that rate it

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    thank you for your column about appropriate gifts for seniors. like many families,
    we, too, have wrestled with the "what do we get for people who have everything?"
    gift dilemma. last year, our family finally hit upon a solution. we discussed
    it with our grandparents. they agreed that it would be more charitable for us
    to give something to people who lack everyday necessities. we adopted a battered
    children''s shelter. those little ones are truly refugees. they need everything
    from toothbrushes and hairbrushes to baby formula and diapers -- not to mention
    toys and games. to our delight, our neighbors got involved in our project, too.
    for weeks, on thursdays, neighbors would leave donations in a sack by their mailbox,
    and we would pick them up. our goal was for every child in that shelter to wake
    up on christmas morning to find packages of necessities and a few playthings.
    the project created so much excitement among our neighbors that we collected enough
    for two shelters. there were pillows, socks, underwear, bath products, cold medicines,
    books, towels, baby clothes, etc. each child also got a large gift basket, including
    a nonbreakable tree ornament to help him or her remember this holiday. the cost
    was small when spread over so many families, but the rewards couldn''t have been
    greater. we felt our project embodied the true spirit of christmas. it sensitized
    our children to the needs of others all year long. because it was one of the best
    holidays we have ever had, we''re repeating the drive again this year. when people
    join together, everyone can make a difference. -- santa''s helpers in phoenix'

    for more than 20 years, my husband and i have been giving gifts to his nephew,
    "barry." barry and his family live 1,300 miles away from us. we haven''t seen
    any of them since barry was 11. we rarely hear from him or his parents except
    on occasions when we''re asked to send a gift. we have never received a thank-you
    from barry, other than his endorsement on our check. now barry is being married.
    my husband and i made a large contribution in the names of the bridal couple to
    a national charity we care about. we also sent a lovely card congratulating them
    and telling them about our gift. we hope this will honor the occasion, do some
    good for people in need, and stem the tide of gift requests. what do you think?

    excuse me, but did i miss something in the letter from "cost-conscious in san
    francisco"? why in the name of holy matrimony is he worried about the resale value
    of a diamond engagement ring? is he planning to sell it or pawn it in the future?
    does he expect to get it back in the event of a divorce? does he think he will
    need the money for his retirement? what is this guy thinking? hello? an engagement
    ring is not a financial investment! it is an emotional investment in a lifetime
    relationship. if this guy is worrying about the cost of an engagement ring because
    he thinks the marriage won''t last, then he should not be getting married in the
    first place. had he said he wanted to be nontraditional and choose another kind
    of ring, well -- ok. but in that case, he should have signed his letter, "already

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    first, thank you for providing years of excellent advice and comfort to the american
    people. i must, however, take exception to your response to "never been hit before,"
    whose wife slugged him in the jaw while he was driving on the freeway. i am a
    psychotherapist. there are some important things to know about domestic violence:
    the abused husband should know that the situation will escalate. the type of anger
    she displayed is never about the issue. this is about the release of pent-up anxiety
    in the abuser. the abuse will escalate because it takes more and more anger and
    violence to get the abuser to the physical release she needs. think of cocaine
    and how the "high" keeps demanding larger and larger doses of the drug, and you
    get the picture. that is why we call such people "rageaholics." the most probable
    reason the wife stopped going to anger management classes is that, like most abusers,
    she doesn''t want to change. she has what she wants -- a victim upon whom to focus
    her rage in order to get release. that is why so many abusers cry and feel loving
    toward their victims afterward. they are not remorseful, but momentarily grateful
    for the short-lived end of their own terrible anxiety, most often caused by feeling
    insecure and out-of-control about their own lives. they will use their victims
    again and again when the anxiety returns. abuse of this sort is an addiction.
    the children are being emotionally harmed every time they see and hear their father
    abused. he should gather them up and leave, or make sure that his wife does --
    without the children. neither he nor his children are safe. what is to prevent
    her from driving her family into oncoming traffic next time, picking up a weapon,
    or in his absence abusing the children when she needs to feel in control again?
    the loss of her husband, children and home might convince her to give up her addiction.
    even then, however, there are no guarantees. all we as professionals can do is
    attend to the safety of the rest of the family. the husband is obviously capable
    of making changes and must be urged to do so -- not given the job of being his
    wife''s therapist by explaining her challenges to her. it could trigger the next
    outburst of violence. please rethink your advice to this man, abby. he''s in a
    dangerous spot and must get out. -- cynthia morrow, psy.d.'

    it may seem early for holiday squabbles, but they have already begun in our family.
    my brother, "arlen," and his wife, "lurline," are hosting the christmas get-together.
    i took my brother aside after church last week and told him that due to the weakened
    economy, our business is struggling and we are barely keeping our heads above
    water. i said we couldn''t participate in the family''s annual gift exchange and
    he seemed to understand. a couple of days later, my mother called and raised cain.
    she said since arlen and lurline are hosting the party, we must go along with
    the gift exchange. mom said the expense they were going to for the party -- although
    it is to be a potluck -- obligated us to exchange gifts with everyone. she added
    that my four sisters and their husbands were participating, and it would look
    "funny" if we didn''t. abby, it angers me that we''re being pressured to exchange
    gifts when our budget is already stretched to the max. why can''t mother understand
    our predicament? this is turning into a sour holiday season, and i don''t know
    if we should go in debt for gifts or not. we live in a community less than 30
    minutes away from the family, so skipping the party isn''t an option. what''s
    the answer? -- dee dee in colorado'

    you often hear from people who feel trapped into "competitive grandparenting,"
    feeling they must match the in-laws gift for gift. the same sort of comparison
    can develop between parents and stepparents. the kids encourage it because of
    all the goodies they get. i recently heard my mother deal with the issue in a
    wonderful way. my sister''s 5-year-old was visiting my mother and asked, "are
    you going to take me to the toy store? grandma johnson always does." i was horrified
    because my parents are nowhere near as well off as the "johnsons." but mother
    didn''t get defensive. she just said, "different grandmas are good at different
    things. grandma johnson is your shopping grandma, and i am your cooking grandma."
    and they went into the kitchen and made brownies! isn''t that beautiful? i don''t
    have any grandkids yet, but i have already decided to be their "reading grandma."

    i read with interest the letter from the 90-year-old missouri recycler about what
    she did with her old pantyhose. a few years ago, while driving through a remote
    area of arizona in an rv with my sister and her husband, one of the belts on their
    engine broke. we were stranded. fortunately for us, a truck stopped, and the driver
    offered to help. when we explained our dilemma, he asked, "do either of you ladies
    have a pair of pantyhose?" my sister produced a pair. he promptly cut off the
    legs and twisted them into a rope-like band that he placed around the engine pulleys.
    we started the engine and drove 50 miles per hour behind our kind rescuer to the
    next town -- 16 miles away -- where we were able to purchase a real belt. this
    goes to prove that old pantyhose have an afterlife. -- bob stauffer, gig harbor,

    i am a 61-year-old widow in love with a 64-year-old man who is twice divorced.
    i''ll call him earl. i have always had a crush on earl. we grew up in the same
    little town, but i thought -- and so did he -- that we were cousins. we''re now
    retired and have returned to the small town where we were born. we went out for
    the first time to do some research into our roots and were thrilled to discover
    that we weren''t related after all. earl made it clear at the time that he wanted
    to date me, but didn''t want to get married. he said he was seeing a woman named
    "lucy" from the state he''d lived in before he retired. they had dated for 15
    years and he enjoyed her visits from time to time. i was getting over a 15-year
    relationship and wanted some attention. i didn''t want to get married either,
    so i thought i could handle the arrangement. well, abby, four years have gone
    by. i love earl very much. we spend at least five out of seven nights at his house
    and dine out together nearly every night. we have great fun. we socialize as a
    couple and go to the market, the beach and the flea market together. but when
    it''s time for a visit from lucy, earl says, "i''m having company for the weekend.
    i''ll call you when she leaves." i can''t handle it anymore. i almost lose my
    mind. i''m lost for things to do. i stay home and cry and obsess about whether
    he''s making love to her the way he makes love to me. well, one weekend i lost
    it. i went to his house, rang the bell, and when he opened the door i walked in.
    did i ever get a shock. i have met lucy, and the woman sitting at the breakfast
    table wasn''t lucy. she introduced herself as sybil. i turned around and left
    in tears. as i passed earl at the door, he asked what that was all about. i told
    him to go to hell. three weeks went by. earl never called so, of course, i called
    him and we got back together. lucy still comes to visit -- and so does sybil.
    in fact, lucy is here for the weekend. that''s why i''m writing to you. earl told
    me he''s not in love with me. he says i''m the best sex partner he has ever had.
    he''s also the best sex partner i have ever had. is there any help for me? i love
    him. i have tried dating others. the entire time i''m out with them, i''m miserable
    and thinking of earl. right now, i can''t wait for lucy to leave so i can see

    my husband, "john," was married before. his former wife, "jane," still wears her
    wedding rings on her left hand. she also signs her name "mrs." when she writes

    every year, my husband and his co-workers get together for a holiday dinner at
    a nice restaurant. more than 20 of them participate. most of the men are married,
    but most of the women who work there are single. the problem is that wives are
    not welcome at these parties. my husband and i have been married two years. he
    says this is a nice tradition and that i shouldn''t make waves about not being
    invited. i can''t believe the other wives are happy with this tradition, but to

  body: 'dear readers: today is thanksgiving day. it is an unusual thanksgiving because
    some of the things we americans have always assumed are no longer true. for the
    first time in the history of this country, the sense of personal security that
    the majority of us have taken for granted has been shaken. and yet, if we look
    around we still have much for which to be thankful. let us offer thanks for the
    men and women in our armed forces who are separated from their families during
    this holiday season, who put their lives on the line to defend freedom and democracy
    and to preserve our american dream. let us offer thanks for our police and firefighters
    who put themselves at risk for us day and night in order to safeguard our lives
    and property. let us offer thanks for our medical personnel and health-care workers
    who go above and beyond the call of duty to preserve our health and well-being
    during these stressful times. let us offer thanks to our postal workers -- ever
    faithful, making sure the mail goes through in "rain, or hail, or sleet or snow"
    -- in spite of their concerns for their own health and safety. at a time when
    saboteurs have put dangerous toxins into the mails, these courageous men and women
    persevere every day to keep our citizens connected. i am personally thankful to
    you, dear readers and fellow patriots, for sending me thousands of letters, poems,
    prayers and essays expressing your heartfelt thoughts about the events of sept.
    11. thay are much appreciated. let us all be thankful that we live in a country
    where we worship as we choose, vote according to our consciences and publish our
    opinions without fear of reprisal. president franklin delano roosevelt said, "the
    only thing we have to fear is fear itself." we are being tested, but we will prevail
    and emerge stronger in spite of the battles ahead -- on the home front as well
    as on foreign soil. already we have forged international alliances that were never
    before possible. and now, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer. perhaps you will
    want to use it at your table today: oh, heavenly father, we thank thee for food
    and remember the hungry. we thank thee for health and remember the sick. we thank
    thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee for freedom and remember
    the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service, that thy gifts to us
    may be used for others. amen. p.s. an afterthought: remember, the surest cure
    for the holiday blues is to do something nice for someone else. why not call someone
    who lives alone and invite him or her to share a meal? if your guest doesn''t
    drive or doesn''t like to go out alone after dark, offer to provide the transportation.
    try it. and let me know the results. happy thanksgiving, everyone!'

    my mother-in-law, "vera," is a difficult person. she declares her opinion on anything
    and everything, and doesn''t care whether it''s hurtful, if it''s asked for, or
    even if it''s her place to speak up at all. she also plays favorites with her
    children and grandchildren. vera has always felt it is her right to discipline
    her grandkids, even if their parents are present. my husband says with a chuckle
    that she''s too old to change, that she''s got a good heart and means well. i
    chalk it up to her being meddling and overbearing. vera has treated me with disrespect
    during most of our marriage, many times in front of our children. in spite of
    this, i have never said a bad word about her in front of the children and have
    tried to cover for her when it was obvious she was playing favorites. all this
    has not been easy, because my mother-in-law has not had a lot of time for our
    family. as a result, she doesn''t really know our children individually. my husband
    is blind to how his mother''s behavior has affected our kids. our oldest son is
    now a freshman at a university about half an hour from vera''s home. she remarked
    to me several times before he left that she is looking forward to seeing him on
    weekends, and that she has many chores for him to do. when we were packing our
    son off to school, i mentioned this to him. he looked me straight in the eye and
    said: "no, mom. grandma treats you like dirt. she hasn''t had time for me in the
    last 18 years. now i don''t have time for her." my son asked that i not give vera
    his phone number. we agreed that, to be fair, i would not give anyone in the family
    his number, and that he would take a list of family addresses and phone numbers
    so he could contact relatives himself. abby, what do i say to my mother-in-law?
    i understand where our son is coming from, but i feel he should show some respect
    to his grandmother. he left last weekend, and vera will be calling soon to get

    the letter from "still kicking myself in frazier park, calif.," who walked away
    from a possible romance, prompts my letter. months after a love affair experience
    that began in church with the opening hymn and ended 45 minutes later, i, too,
    am still "kicking myself." last spring, i entered the cathedral where i regularly
    attend 10:30 mass. because i was late, the middle section where i usually sit
    was full. i quickly slid into an empty pew toward the front. as i did, i noticed
    an attractive dark-haired man seated behind me. the organist played the first
    note. i opened my mouth to sing and then stopped to listen to the rich tenor directly
    behind me. encouraged by the strength and beauty of his voice, i joined in, assuming
    his phrasing would cover my mistakes. instead of being overshadowed, his voice
    complemented mine. we began to sing unscored harmony as though we had practiced
    together for years. our voices flowed in concert with the organist. time stopped
    for me while we sang together throughout the entire mass. with each successive
    hymn and response, we were a team singing duets. i turned to shake his hand during
    the traditional kiss of peace. he warmly held mine in both of his, and his shining
    hazel eyes looked directly into mine. smiling back, i wanted to speak, but i was
    dumbfounded. what i felt was so unexpected and powerful that i suddenly became
    shy. what could i say? god had arranged a perfect setting, and i could only lower
    my eyes. aware of him behind me in the communion line, i resolved to say something
    -- anything -- to him before leaving church. at least i could comment on his remarkable
    voice. however, after mass he disappeared and has never returned. perhaps he was
    in town on business, which makes another meeting unlikely. or he may have been
    merely grateful for the opportunity to sing. could there have been more to the
    day? my heart says yes -- but there is no way to know. -- with a song in my heart

    she resolved to make preparations in case of her untimely death. she purchased
    a life insurance policy and made out her will. this seems reasonable to me, but
    in addition, she also wrote her own eulogy. at the time i thought it was strange,

    from a good friend''s wedding, she spent the better part of a saturday working

    mom died suddenly in june of 1982, a mere three months after we helped my parents
    celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. seeing dad so broken and old at the
    funeral, we ached for him and worried about his health and future. silly us! by
    the end of the year, he called to inform us that he was seeing "jane," a widowed
    longtime friend, and that they were being married. i was speechless (a rare occurrence,
    according to my wife), but quickly gave my blessing along with my brother and
    two sisters. we knew that mom and dad were soulmates, but if dad was lucky enough
    to find love again, who were we to deny him? dad passed away last june, three
    months after we celebrated his 80th birthday. we''re heartbroken, but our grief
    is tempered by thoughts of dad''s happy and full 18 years spent with jane. his
    life was honored by hundreds of family and friends at his funeral service. i know
    i speak for the rest of the family in saying that we owe jane an eternal debt
    of love and gratitude for sharing her life with dad. we embrace her as part of
    the family and will continue to do so until the day she leaves us. your advice
    to "desperate" neglected to address one small detail. unless they had obtained
    a court order, the wiretap his daughters put on his phone was illegal, and they
    could have been prosecuted. what i say to "desperate" is simply this: sir, if
    you are fortunate enough to find love again in the autumn of your life, go ahead
    and jump in, right after you tell your daughters to go take a flying leap! --

    my high school sweetheart and i reunited and married after his wife of eight years
    died of breast cancer. she was only 39. they had a sweet little girl together,
    and i brought my two little ones into our new relationship. we have been together
    for five years and are a very happy blended family. my husband''s former wife
    -- i''ll call her nicki -- was very close to her parents and siblings. after nicki''s
    death, they continued their strong relationship with their granddaughter and my
    husband, and were very accepting of me and my children when we joined the family.
    however, one issue troubles me just a bit: nicki''s parents and siblings continue
    to address my husband as "son-in-law" or "brother-in-law." i know they loved their
    daughter, and i respect their feelings, but "till death do us part" means just
    that, and sadly, the title son-in-law died with their daughter. i feel their continued

    this is for "a mother who cares a lot," who asked, "what do you say when your

    you hug your daughter and say: "i''m so glad you told me. your dad and i want
    you to know we love you. we realize that coming out is difficult, and we''ll do
    whatever we can to help." your daughter has not "turned into" anything. she is
    what she is and has been since she was born. your protestations that you are "respectable
    people" who "raised her properly" suggest underlying ignorance and homophobia,
    which is probably what led to her trying to meet your expectations by marrying.
    she has evidently realized she could no longer maintain this pretense. you say
    you "try to be loving and kind." well, try harder. did you love your child when
    she was an infant? a toddler? a young girl? well, she''s still your child. and
    she needs that love now more than ever, to help her face others whose reactions

    i understand the emotion involved in the "coming out" process because i, too,
    am the mother of a lesbian. the daughter of "mother who cares" didn''t "turn into"
    a lesbian but, of course, was always gay, and unwilling or unable to acknowledge
    it. this is a wonderful opportunity for those loving parents to stand by their
    daughter and to accept and respect her for having the courage to live the life
    she was born to. what kind of parents are we if we protect and nurture our children,
    encourage them to be honest with themselves and follow their dreams, only to reject
    them when they do? "mother" didn''t mention whether she is their only child. if
    so, this is their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove their unconditional
    love. "mother" should learn about homosexuality, talk with her daughter about
    her feelings, express her own feelings, and use this experience to bond the family

    with, and i have fallen for him hard. there is one problem: danny doesn''t make
    much money. he works hard in his field, but it''s either feast or famine. i, on
    the other hand, earn a very substantial salary. i have been afraid to share this
    fact with danny for several reasons. one, my career intimidated my previous boyfriend,

    anyway. abby, should i keep my income a secret from danny, or is that considered

    a couple was escorted to the table. the gentleman was a famous personality. i
    tried to be discreet about glancing their way and wished i''d brought a book to
    read. i was feeling melancholy. my first vacation without my husband was not a
    happy one. evidently my demeanor was interpreted as "unhappy lady." the server
    appeared and said, "the couple at the corner table would like to send a glass
    of champagne to your table. will that be all right with you?" i glanced at the
    couple; they smiled. how could i not accept their thoughtful gesture? the glass
    was placed on my table. i caught their eye and lifted my glass to toast them on

    i am in my mid-20s and have found the perfect man. we are very much in love and
    have discussed marriage. we are sexually active and responsible about using birth
    control. a week and a half ago, my period was noticeably late. i voiced my concerns
    to "bob." he assured me everything would be fine and tried to console me; however,
    he never said anything about marrying me if i was pregnant. it turned out to be
    a false alarm. last night, bob told me he needed "space"; that there are things
    he needs to accomplish in life before getting married. he said his decision had
    nothing to do with me and that he still loves me very much. i find it too coincidental
    that this change came about only a week after my possible pregnancy. we talked
    it over and ended our relationship. abby, i couldn''t bear the thought of being
    with a man who is capable of running away from his responsibility. i, too, have
    things i''d like to accomplish in life, but i would have liked to achieve them
    with bob by my side. do you think i made the right decision to end it, or did
    i overreact? -- at a loss in atlanta'

    i am a 12-year-old girl and i need some advice. my dad recently had an affair
    with a woman he met when he went back to school. she is also married. he asked
    her to marry him, but she said no, so he decided to come back home. he has left
    us twice before, so my home isn''t very stable. my parents got married at a very
    young age and have been together for 26 years. mom tells me she doesn''t want
    to get divorced, because she is still in love with him and thinks that "a two-parent
    home is better than a one-parent home." she may be right, but even my counselor
    agrees that one stable parent is better than two unstable parents. now that dad

    our oldest daughter "bonnie" has just entered into her second relationship since
    her recent divorce. we are concerned that she continually uproots our grandchildren
    to move to a different place. we feel it''s time a woman in her 30s "settled down"
    and gave her children a stable home environment. the father of the children was
    killed in an unfortunate accident. each time she claims to be "in love" and expects
    us to welcome her new man when we have barely had time to adjust to the last one.
    our youngest daughter, "june," feels as we do. consequently, the two girls no
    longer speak. our dilemma: since we all live far away from each other, we get
    together once a year for a family reunion. we always stay with june and her family
    because bonnie has never had a spare room until now. our reunion is coming up,
    and because of the rift we won''t all be together. we would like to see bonnie
    and the grandchildren, but are not interested in meeting her new man or traveling
    to her new home. how can i diplomatically explain to bonnie and settle on a neutral
    place to meet without any hurt feelings? -- caught in the middle'

    in january of 1994, my loving wife and best friend of 47 years passed away. i
    was devastated, but i am also realistic. i was 71, healthy, virile, fun-loving
    and enjoyed life. a little over a month after my wife''s funeral, i was tired
    of being alone and went to a resort. i met a lovely woman there, and a few weeks
    later, i called and invited her to dinner. we spent more than six hours talking,
    sharing a couple of small glasses of wine, and were more interested in each other
    than the food. when i got home, i received a call from my younger daughter and
    was given the third degree. it was only the beginning. in spite of the interference,
    this lady and i continued to enjoy each other''s company. we lived together for
    a year and a half and then married. i gave my daughters one of our family trusts
    to allay their fear that someone might get something they thought was all theirs.
    it didn''t help. they continued to drive a wedge between my wife and me. i later
    discovered they put a tap on my phone. so, where did all this lead? you guessed
    it. divorce court. it has been a year and a half; i recently met a lady on the
    internet. we have been writing and talking on the phone almost daily. three weeks
    ago, we met in paris and spent a great week together. no sex was involved -- just
    a great time. the lady plans to come here to visit. tonight my younger daughter
    informed me she intends to run her off. as far as my daughters are concerned,
    i don''t need a friend, a companion or wife. they are worried that someone besides
    them will get whatever i have left. they tell me i don''t need anyone; just our
    family is enough. i love my grandchildren, but to be honest, i don''t need my
    children running my life. abby, the lady in question is in her late 50s, is well-educated,

    think nothing of holding a baby and a lighted cigarette at the same time. my sister-in-law''s
    kids have allergies and asthma, but she smokes around them anyway. parties at
    my in-laws'' are literally a cloud of smoke. when my husband''s family are guests

    weather approaching, all our visits will be indoors. our daughter''s pediatrician
    says no one is to smoke around her. my husband refuses to say anything to his
    parents about the smoke and insists we take our baby to their house. what can

    my problem concerns people who are chronically late. i''m talking about my mother-in-law.
    when she''s invited for dinner or a family outing, i can count on her being the
    last to arrive -- 30 to 45 minutes late. meanwhile, my side of the family gets
    tired of waiting for her while dinner gets cold on the table. my husband (her
    son) insists that we wait until she arrives to begin eating, while i think we
    should go ahead and start without her. my husband says i am rude. abby, who is
    most rude -- my mother-in-law for showing up late, my husband for sticking up
    for her, or me for insisting that dinner be served on time, with or without her?

    with regard to the column you printed about the woman who wore a tongue stud while
    being interviewed for a job: as a teacher, i talk to classrooms of students about
    how they dress and what their attire conveys to the people who see them. i ask
    these students: "when you see someone dressed like a policeman, what do you think
    that person does? when you see someone dressed like a nurse or a doctor, what
    do you think that person does? if you saw someone walk into a bank with a stocking
    pulled over his head, what would you think? how about when you see someone wearing
    a business suit?" etc. finally, i ask, "what are you trying to say to people when
    you dress?" what we wear is a statement to the people around us. how we dress,
    tattoo, pierce, style our hair and present ourselves is an expression of who we
    are, and a message to the people we encounter. do not be defensive if they react
    to the message you are sending. -- lea in minnesota'

    my sandals, i discovered a shiny penny wedged between my sandal strap and the

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i''m writing this because of letters and surveys i have seen that indicate a large
    percentage of american women lack interest in sex. i hope my experience will help
    other wives. my husband has always been a generous and thoughtful lover. however,
    my lack of interest in sex for more than 10 years caused much sorrow and frustration.
    once i told my husband i would give him a divorce if it weren''t for our children.
    he said he never wanted to hear that again -– he loved me and wasn''t going anywhere.
    though that was incredibly reassuring, my difficulties with sex continued. i sought
    counseling, but although i realized some of my problem resulted from unwise earlier
    sexual relationships and issues with my parents, nothing changed for the better.
    in my bitterness, i could never call sex "making love." then one day in passing,
    i heard the comment, "sex isn''t entertainment." "well, what is it then?" i wondered.
    it came to me that sex then must be about love and giving, cherishing and adoring
    another person, and the other person also giving, cherishing and adoring in return
    -– a supreme representation of unconditional love given exclusively between two
    people. this understanding changed everything. the next time my husband and i
    had sex, i thought about how much i cared about him, all the many loving things
    he did for me, and tried to give myself in cherishing and adoring him. it was
    an amazing, healing and transcendent experience unlike anything i had experienced.
    it was making love for the first time. energy i never knew i had emerged and i
    "made love" three more times that weekend with my amazed but grateful husband.
    i have gone from dreading sex to realizing i would miss it if i lost my husband.
    although at times i need to remind myself what i have learned, i feel reborn to
    my marriage and able to love my husband more deeply –- which is true joy. i am
    so grateful. one more observation: since my new outlook more than a year ago,
    i truly believe the casual and graphic way sex is portrayed on television and
    movies cheapens it and encourages an attitude that definitely made my difficulties
    much worse. the use of sex -- or violence, for that matter -- by the media for
    ratings or money causes much distorted thinking and needless pain in many people.

    at our halloween party last year, which included both parents and children, my
    brother and i somewhat jokingly debated the two presidential candidates. my brother
    was for bush. i was for gore. sometime during the evening, my then 11-year-old
    daughter asked me why her uncle was for bush and i was for gore. i explained why
    i was for gore and gave her four or five reasons. she asked again why her uncle
    was for bush. i told her to go ask him. during the merriment of the evening, i
    forgot about the subject until we were on the way home and my daughter asked me
    how i could think that killing a little baby was ok. i was speechless! i asked
    her where she had gotten such an idea. she said her uncle had told her that gore
    thought it was ok to kill babies, and if i was voting for him, so did i. i tried
    to explain about a woman''s right to choose -- and that i do think a woman should
    have that choice, but i was so shocked i hardly knew how to defend myself. it
    has been nearly a year now. ever since that night my daughter has been very distant
    toward me. i have tried to talk to her about it several times, but she refuses
    to discuss it. i''m at my wit''s end. my daughter is now 12 and our closeness
    has been destroyed. i found out her class made mother''s day cards, but my daughter
    never gave hers to me. there are no more hugs and kisses at bedtime -- just "good
    night." what can i do? i love my daughter with all my heart. i''d give anything
    to have her the way she was before. -- destroyed mother in dallas'

    here''s a topper for your "can you top this" collection. my wife and i attended
    a lovely wedding. the groom was a 45-year-old physician; his bride is a 38-year-old
    professional. it was a first marriage for both, a lavish affair with a reception
    and formal dinner following the ceremony. six weeks later, we received the following
    e-mail from the newlyweds: "dear friends: we''re back from our glorious honeymoon
    romp through the game parks of east africa, and still basking in the glow of our
    wedding. "tomorrow we''re meeting with the catering manager at the hotel where
    our wedding was held, because we''re disputing the liquor bill from the wedding
    dinner. their claim works out to seven drinks per person! this is separate from
    the wine and champagne served during dinner. "would you please e-mail us the number
    and kind of drinks you drank at our wedding? we are meeting at 9 a.m. so we need
    your response asap. thank you (all) for making our wedding so special." abby,

    no live-in mother-in-law, no boom-box neighbors; nevertheless, i''ve got a problem.
    i was flying home from a european vacation recently, when i realized fate had
    plunked down beside me the answer to my prayers. a graduate of brown, "janis"
    had been working in an olive grove in italy. she was everything: pretty, demure,
    irish, intelligent, svelte, "with it." all that and a great sense of humor as
    well. we talked, we laughed, and during the movie our arms accidentally touched
    more than chance would dictate. we were falling in love at 37,000 feet as clouds
    raced past beneath us. too soon, the image on the screen told us we were nearing
    new york''s kennedy airport and the end of our "summer romance." as we unloaded
    the overhead bins, janis said, "i guess we won''t be seeing each other again --
    unless it''s at the baggage carousel?" a definite opening. she looked stunned
    when i replied, "have a nice life, janis." abby, how could i have said such a
    stupid thing? what possessed me after god had gone to all that trouble setting
    up the right day, the right flight, the right seat, next to the right woman? i
    rationalize that maybe it was the geography. she in seattle; i in l.a. more likely
    it was fear of rejection. balzac wrote something like: "no lady, no matter how
    chaste, is ever really offended by an overture of love." i keep forgetting that
    at crucial moments. and unlike streetcars, another janis won''t come along in
    20 minutes. it would be interesting to know, abby, how many of your readers have
    lost a love, a "happily ever after," because they were too shy, too governed by
    propriety, to reveal what was in their hearts. probably thousands. when you think

    i am a teen-age girl, and i''d like to offer some advice to other teens before
    they decide to have sex. besides the possibility of getting pregnant or a sexually
    transmitted disease (std), here are three reasons to remain a virgin: 1. when
    you get married, you want to be faithful to your spouse, right? well, if you have
    sex now, you are already cheating on your future spouse. 2. even though there
    are different kinds of contraceptives to choose from, none of them can protect
    your emotions. when you have sex, you become emotionally entangled with the other
    person. that''s why it hurts so much if you break up. sex should be part of a
    lifelong commitment. 3. sex doesn''t mean love. if your date doesn''t respect
    your wishes not to have sex, he or she doesn''t love you. abby, please print this.

    since my mother''s death eight years ago, i have kept artificial flowers on her

    on mom''s grave, because yellow roses were her favorite flower. i don''t think
    live roses are appropriate on a grave, so i asked the cemetery attendant about
    it. he told me no one had ever made such a request, but he was unaware of any
    policy about planting flowers on graves. he''s a friend of the family, so i''m
    sure he won''t tell eva that she can''t plant a rose bush. he did comment that
    the bush would have to be kept pruned so that it wouldn''t interfere with mowing.
    abby, would i be out of line to ask my sister not to follow through on her plan?
    the grave is near the center of our family plot, and i think the bush would be
    out of place. and who would be responsible for the care of the roses? i have taken
    pride in how mother''s grave has looked all these years, but i don''t want to
    take care of a live plant. couldn''t eva just plant a rose bush in her own yard

    i could have been one of those outcast teens who shoot classmates when i was younger.
    like them, i felt that i did not belong within the confines of my school. the
    torment started in the eighth grade and continued through my senior year of high
    school. i was taunted by nearly everyone in class, made fun of because i was unpopular,
    and made to feel small and insignificant. i remember walking up the sidewalk to
    school, palms sweating, stomach in knots, knowing once again i faced another day
    trying to make myself as invisible as possible. it rarely worked. my tormentors
    always managed to use me as their whipping boy. there were times i would lay my
    head on my desk, tears streaming down my face, the other kids laughing and making
    jokes about me. not once did a teacher or principal come to my aid. it was as
    if my feelings were unimportant, or they had a mind-set that "kids will be kids."
    i struggled through school and kept my grades as high as possible under the circumstances
    i faced daily. so why did i not take vengeance on my classmates with the nearest
    weapon? the answer is simple: my parents were always there for me. they were aware
    of my problems at school. every day they listened to my fears and concerns, and
    reassured me that i was a special person and the taunts meant nothing with regard
    to who i really was. they cried with me, held me and listened to every word i
    said. they encouraged me to become my own person and to never let anyone tell
    me who i was or was not. i''m saddened when i hear about young outcasts who can''t
    cope being driven over the edge. these lives are cut short because nobody intervened
    when they saw what was happening. i wish i could tell them how important they
    are and what possibilities life has in store for them. i know what that would
    mean to them because i know what it meant to me. every day i thank god for giving
    me such wonderful parents. they understood and didn''t ignore the fact that their
    son was in pain. it took years of struggle to get past those horrible experiences
    in school, but i finally accomplished it. today i am a successful, well-adjusted
    human being. my only regret is that i have no fond memories of high school. abby,
    until we recognize the true impact of teasing in our schools, this situation will
    continue to occur. please ask your readers -- parents, teachers and even students
    -- to be sensitive to that young person who needs support through troubling times.
    they might save someone''s life -- perhaps even their own. -- former outcast,

    tooth fairy and the easter bunny. my wife doesn''t like one suggestion the therapist
    made. i believe it could work well. the therapist said we should have one weekend
    a month free. from friday at 6 p.m. to midnight sunday (54 hours), i take care
    of the kids and house, and my wife can do whatever she wants with the time and
    $120. i get the same on my weekend. the other two weekends are for the family,
    and the children choose alternating activities from my wife''s list or mine. on
    my weekend i go away fishing, camping, hiking or whatever. this is what my wife
    hates. abby, i need the time alone, undisturbed, and have felt much better since
    i started doing it. i also enjoy having the kids alone without my wife constantly

    i recently turned my brother "paul" in to drug enforcement. paul has been a drug

    robbed twice, totaling about $10,000. my mother has depleted any money she has
    had by paying his expenses, and our family is always in turmoil. aunts, uncles
    and grandparents have all agreed on tough love by cutting him off in every way
    we know how. my mother has not. she''s still supporting him, paying for housing,
    utilities and food. my husband and i agreed that our son is not allowed to spend
    time at my mother''s house because paul is still welcome there. she feels we are
    trying to punish her and she won''t speak to me. i had discovered paul was selling
    drugs to children as young as 12 to support his habit. i couldn''t have lived
    with myself if i hadn''t turned him in. this could have been my child he was selling
    to. my family, with the exception of my husband, son and paul''s wife, feels that
    i should have handled it differently -- that what i did was excessive. paul''s

    earlier this year, you printed a poem, "words of love?" about what abusers say.
    my wife told me for years that i was abusing her, but i didn''t believe it. i
    grew up in a home where we were severely controlled and abused by our father.
    my brother and sister were also sexually abused by dad. i''m lucky i escaped that
    kind of abuse. we have all confronted him. he has no remorse for what he did.
    when i read the poem, i realized that i had been abusing my wife. since my whole
    life had been built on not being like my father, i don''t know how i let this
    happen. i cut the poem out and had it laminated. i always carry it with me. i
    will never say those things to my wife -- or any woman -- again. i gave my wife
    a copy of the poem with the abuses highlighted that i had committed, along with
    flowers, my sincere apology, and my promise never to abuse her again. it''s amazing
    how much better i feel about myself since i recognized my abusive behavior and
    decided to change. the poem said abusers don''t change, but as god is my witness,
    i will. i am seeing a therapist in an attempt to deal with my childhood and put
    the "old me" behind me. abby, had i not read your column, i never would have seen

    "oh. my friend jimmy said he came from st. louis." my son''s father died when
    he was 2, so i was left to deal with the mountain of never-ending questions. beating
    around the bush was unacceptable to my son. when he was 6, he asked how the baby
    had gotten into the stomach of a woman at church. i explained about planting seeds
    and flowers growing. he then proceeded to ask how the seed got planted, who planted
    it, and what part the daddy played in this. on and on -- until finally, after
    admonishing my son not to share this information with his younger friends, i gave
    him "the facts of life" lecture in as much detail as he seemed to want. as long

    i hold strong beliefs about historic preservation and zero population growth.
    you could call me an activist. i am generally against any sort of land development.
    however, i recognize and respect that others -- including my longtime boyfriend,
    "brian" -- do not share my beliefs. we recently attended a small dinner party.
    a young couple we had just met were enthusiastically discussing their purchase
    of an undeveloped plot of land in one of our city''s oldest neighborhoods. they
    are planning to build a new home. i smiled and said nothing. brian, however, volunteered
    the fact that i believe it''s unethical to develop virgin land, and that people
    who have the means to do it should restore old homes instead. while i tried to
    demur, everyone at the table insisted i explain myself. i was mad at my boyfriend,
    and later told him he was rude to the couple for putting a damper on their happiness
    -- and to me, for forcing me to assume an adversarial position with people i barely
    knew. brian says we''re all mature adults and we should be able to have an engaging
    discussion about such topics without hurt feelings or anger. what do you say,

    i am 33, married and the father of three children. i was adopted at three weeks
    of age and never felt the need to search for my "roots" or "identity" like many
    others do. about five years ago, i received a letter from my birth mother, and
    we have met a few times. although she and her family are nice people, and want
    to continue a relationship -- i do not. i have hinted about the way i feel, but
    they don''t seem to understand. i want to tell them outright, but my wife says
    i will hurt their feelings, and i should leave "the door open" in case i change
    my mind. i am sure of my feelings and disagree with my wife. i learned that my
    birth mother was going through a bitter divorce while she was pregnant with me.
    money was scarce and she felt she could not afford a third child. she later remarried
    -- as did my birth father. i met him once, and he has been more considerate of
    my feelings. he respects my privacy. my birth mother is kind and generous. she
    always remembers my children on birthdays and holidays. abby, how can i cut off

    i must respond to the letter from "tacoma mom," who complained that her ex-husband
    didn''t want to take their 6-year-old to his swimming lesson during his regularly
    scheduled wednesday night visit. i, too, am a divorced mother who is happily remarried.
    unlike "tacoma mom," i do not wish to control every moment of my daughter''s time
    with her father. watching the children participate in a sport does not allow the
    quality time divorced parents should have. everyone talks about the importance
    of a father''s role in a child''s life. does that apply only if he follows the
    schedule given to him by the mother? i am sure that when the family was intact,
    "tacoma mom" didn''t tell the father how to spend his time with his son. after
    a divorce, people are consumed by hurt and anger. children are too often caught
    in the middle and used as a way of "getting back" at each other. while i agree
    that the tacoma father should be involved in the child''s activities, divorced
    fathers need time with their children on their terms, not ours. this is what creates
    a bond between fathers and their children. my daughter and i enjoy a close and
    loving relationship; i believe her father is entitled to one, too. she and her
    father do things that i don''t do -- fish, camp, work on cars. she has two very
    different and fulfilling lives. that is what keeps her well-adjusted. her father
    and i have developed a healthy relationship where our daughter is concerned. we
    always keep her best interests in mind. abby, shouldn''t a mother consult the
    father before signing up the children for activities that interfere with his time?
    they are his children, too. or is this just a power struggle of a bitter woman?

    i hope you''ll print this and stop an urban legend in its tracks. a year ago,
    my husband was handed a copy of a petition at work to sign and pass along. this
    petition was to stop madalyn murray o''hair. she, as head of an atheist group,
    was filing a petition to the fcc to stop all religious programming from being
    aired on television and radio. needless to say, i was outraged! and why not? i
    am a mother and a loyal american who believes wholeheartedly in religious freedom
    and freedom of the press. i immediately logged on to the internet and e-mailed
    this petition to everyone in my address book. then i made photocopies and mailed
    them to friends and family who weren''t online. i jumped in with both feet to
    stop madalyn murray o''hair and her group from destroying all that christians
    and americans hold dear. the only thing i didn''t do (at least at first) was check
    the facts. had i done so, i would have saved myself a lot of money and time. the
    reality is that this petition is just one in a number of urban legends being spread
    today. until i typed the name "madalyn murray o''hair" into my search engine,
    i had no idea that i was not working to stop an atheist from taking away our freedoms,
    but was instead perpetuating a myth. spreading rumors may seem harmless, but it''s
    not. it can cost everyone involved a good chunk of change when you add up the
    cost of postage, photocopying, stationery and envelopes. it also fuels ignorance
    and wastes time. the fcc actually had to hire people to handle the flood of mail
    on this subject. abby, i have been sent this petition five times in one year.
    can you believe that? please inform your readers that forwarding e-mail or "snail
    mail" -- or signing petitions without checking the facts -- is senseless and irresponsible.
    these "legends" feed on the blind faith of the readers. they rely on the tendency
    we have to follow our impulses. we should always do our homework before passing
    anything on, and especially before signing anything. it could save a load of trouble

    i am a 13-year-old girl, and i''m afraid i''ve dug my own grave. my older sister,
    "celeste," had a baby three months ago. yesterday, she and her boyfriend got into
    a fight, and i saw him hit her. celeste assured me she was going to tell our father,
    but i know she won''t. this morning, our stepmom manipulated me into telling her
    what happened. i''m afraid of what celeste will do when she finds out i told she
    was hit. i''m afraid she and her boyfriend will forbid me from seeing my new niece.

    last night, my wife and i attended a potluck dinner. it was held in an older home
    that had recently been moved on a truck from its original location. during the
    evening, i had to use the bathroom. the door opened inward, and i pushed it closed
    from the inside. when i was ready to leave, i realized the door knob was missing.
    i pulled on the towel rack attached to the back of the door, but it came off in
    my hand. the door was firmly stuck in its frame, and there was no way to open
    it. i unlatched the window. unlike the door, it was loose in its frame and wouldn''t
    stay up. i used the towel rack to prop it open while i climbed out. unfortunately,
    as i was making my escape, my foot caught on the towel rack. the window came crashing
    down. it shattered, attracting the attention of everyone there. my wife says the
    proper thing to do would have been to bang on the bathroom door and wait for someone
    to let me out. abby, i am a professional man and to do that would have been undignified.
    my wife says i should pay to replace the broken window. i think they are lucky
    i didn''t sprain my ankle when i jumped out. what is the correct protocol for
    dealing with this type of unexpected social situation? -- locked in the loo'

    may i offer a new clause to the "safety contract for a new driver" that appeared
    in your column? it would read: "i promise not to use a cellular phone while driving."

    such a thing from happening again, a law to stop people from talking on the phone
    while driving can''t come soon enough. i used to be in outside sales and carried
    a cellular phone in my car for business. however, when i used it, i always pulled
    over to the side of the road so i could give my customer my undivided attention.

    i''m a 36-year-old "super mom." i''m active in pta, shuttle our two daughters
    and their friends around town, play on a community softball team, go to a gym
    twice a week, and work wednesdays in a small sports equipment store owned by my
    in-laws. my older daughter, "jenny" (a junior in high school), stopped by the
    store last wednesday after school. a few minutes later a nervous-looking man entered.
    he asked me about some ski equipment, and then -- holding what he claimed was
    a gun in his pocket -- demanded money from the register. abby, if i had been there
    alone i would have walloped him and run for the door, but i didn''t want to take
    any chances with my daughter there. i told him to take what he wanted and leave.
    well, that wasn''t the end of it. he ordered us into the back room, told us to
    lie face down, bound our hands and feet with duct tape, gagged us and left. despite
    heroic tugging and squirming, neither jenny nor i could free ourselves. it was
    more than an hour before a customer came in, heard us moaning and found us trussed
    up in the back of the store. thinking back, i was more angry than scared during
    the time we lay bound. mostly i was worried that jenny would be traumatized for
    life. i felt completely helpless. i could hardly believe what happened next. when
    we were freed, jenny wasn''t traumatized. she became furious -- at me! she literally
    screamed at me, "why did you let him tie us up, mom?" she apparently felt -- and
    still feels -- that we could have used kung fu on him or something. although i
    still think i did the right thing, i feel guilty that my daughter is disillusioned
    because her mother allowed someone to tie us up without a fight. i have gone from
    super mom to super schnook. any ideas on how to win back my daughter''s admiration?

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i would like to pose a question to your readers who are parents: would you hand
    your child a lighted match? the idea is absurd. yet each independence day, thousands
    of parents don''t give a second thought to giving their children sparklers --
    lighted sticks that can burn at a temperature up to 1,200 degrees fahrenheit.
    last year, more than 8,000 people in the united states (most of them children)
    received treatment at an emergency room for injuries related to fireworks. keep
    in mind this figure does not include injuries treated by private physicians or
    those not treated at all. i would like to remind your readers of all ages that
    fireworks (sparklers included) are not toys. please leave fireworks to the professionals.
    the number of people who sustain serious burns, loss of eyesight or other disfiguring
    trauma as a result of fireworks is evidence that there is no safe way for amateurs
    to use them. july fourth and fireworks are practically synonymous. i am not suggesting
    that fireworks be banned from the celebration; however, the associated risks must
    be recognized -- and reduced. professional pyrotechnicians are trained to adhere
    to state-of-the-art codes for public fireworks displays. the only "safe" way to
    enjoy fireworks this july is at one of these public displays -- from a distance.

    my wife and i moved into a new house with our son about six months ago. after

    with overnight guests. the rule is simple: if a family member or friend asks to
    spend the night, each of us must check with the others before agreeing. we do
    this in case there is a conflict and out of respect for each other. last week,
    my sister, "lisa," who lives out of town, called to ask me if she could spend
    the night. i told her i needed to check with my wife and son, but i didn''t think
    it would be a problem. lisa was appalled and insulted that i would have to check
    with my wife and son before "allowing" her to stay. in her wildest dreams, she
    couldn''t imagine ever having to check with her husband and kids. after she hung
    up, she told a bunch of her friends about it. she told me they, too, were flabbergasted
    that i would say such a thing to my sister. abby, my wife, son and i have had

    in 1941, when the japanese bombed pearl harbor, i was a 17-year-old seaman on
    a destroyer in the north atlantic. there were several other teen-agers on board.
    we all smoked, as did the rest of the crew. cigarettes were 6 cents a pack. at
    that price, the saying was, we couldn''t afford not to smoke. we happily discussed
    the merits of lucky strikes, camels and chesterfields. old golds and pall malls
    were not as popular; kools were for sissies. none of us realized that all the
    brands we smoked contained the same poisonous, addictive substances. people who
    didn''t smoke were considered odd. if they didn''t like to be around smokers,
    they were the ones with the problem. it wasn''t until years later that i realized
    the purpose of selling cigarettes so cheaply to servicemen was to get our generation
    hooked for the profit of tobacco companies. my addiction lasted until after i
    was married and had small children. fortunately, i realized in time that if i
    was going to live to see them grow up, i was going to have to kick the habit --
    and by the grace of god i was able to. why am i writing this? because two of my
    grandsons have succumbed to the slick advertising and lies of the tobacco companies
    in spite of warnings from those who love them most. i pray they''ll realize the

    i have asked my wife, martha, to send this to you immediately upon my death. i
    want teen-agers to know i died from a self-inflicted disease -- smoking. back
    in the 1940s, a majority of americans smoked. it was the adult thing to do. i
    "knew" i wouldn''t get hooked. we knew smoking wasn''t good for us, but we were
    willing to take our chances. we called cigarettes "coffin nails" and laughed as
    we lit up. years later, i was diagnosed with emphysema. my heart was weakened
    because it had enlarged, trying to pump blood into lungs that could no longer
    expand. i had to stop smoking or die an early death from a heart attack, stroke,
    cancer or slow suffocation. "no sweat," i thought. "i can quit anytime." how wrong
    i was. i spent more than $1,000 on smoking-cessation programs. i tried acupuncture,
    hypnosis, gum, patches, pills and cold turkey. nothing worked. i was addicted,
    dying and couldn''t quit. you say you want "freedom"? how free are you when you
    want to go dancing or hiking but can''t because your nose is hooked to plastic
    tubing attached to an oxygen tank 24 hours a day, just so you can breathe? i could
    have had 20 more years of active, healthy, productive life. i could have bought
    a new car with the thousands i spent on cigarettes, doctors and oxygen equipment.
    i could have had more happy years with my loving wife. i chose to smoke instead.
    abby, i wish i had listened to my dad. he once told me, "graveyards are filled
    with people who said, ''it won''t happen to me.''" -- bert hudson, sand coulee,

    my letter is in response to the one in your column about the peeping tom. your
    advice was 100 percent correct. my first husband was a peeping tom. if someone
    had told me about my husband, i wouldn''t have believed him or her and probably
    would have gotten angry with that person. my husband was well thought of, and
    you can''t imagine that someone you love and admire would be capable of doing
    something like that. he lied so convincingly about why he was late -- and even
    when he was eventually arrested -- i not only believed him, but most people other
    than the police did too. abby, peeping toms do not get over it. they just get
    worse. they think there is nothing wrong with them. we were trying to have another
    baby when he was arrested the first time. naturally we put it off until the trial
    was over. can you believe he was only fined for trespassing? the witnesses were
    a policeman and a minister, but the jury believed my husband. he explained it
    away. my husband was arrested three times in our 12-year marriage for peeping.
    i finally had to face facts. when i did, i had a nervous breakdown. he married
    again, molested his stepdaughters and was sent to prison. he could have gotten
    out on probation after he served a couple of years if he had agreed to have therapy.
    he chose to stay in prison rather than seek help because he insisted there wasn''t
    anything wrong with him. if you print this, please do not use my name. it has
    been 25 years since i left him, but i remember the shame and disbelief as if it
    were yesterday. even today some people think it was all a mistake. -- trusting

    i am a 34-year-old woman living in my parents'' home. we have a male friend, 10
    years older than i am, who is the caretaker of a campground we visit during the
    summer. last fall he invited me to visit with him at the campground. when i told
    my mother about my weekend plans, she seemed ok with it at first. the next morning,
    she told me she and my father had discussed it and didn''t think it was appropriate
    for me to go there alone because he lives by himself in a secluded area. she felt
    we don''t know him well enough, and we couldn''t be sure what he was thinking.
    i did go to see him, but only for the day. since january, i have been talking
    to him on the phone trying to get to know him better. i think he''s trustworthy.
    i''m sure he has strong moral values and religious beliefs. he has always shown
    respect for my parents and me. he has invited me to visit again. when i mentioned
    it, my mother said she would be more comfortable with the idea if my younger brother
    and his girlfriend chaperoned me. abby, i think i can trust him. i''m quite sure
    i can handle myself. but mother would rather i drive six hours round-trip in one
    day instead of spending the night in his guest house. i would like to explore
    this relationship a little further -- i think something good could come of it.

    let go, i may never find anyone she feels is good enough for me. -- wants freedom

    nine months ago, my 30-year-old daughter, "natalie," who lives on the west coast,
    announced that she wished to be married in july in our east coast waterfront home.
    i told her i''d be happy to host her wedding. last christmas, she wrote our east
    coast family members (who number over 60) asking them to save the date. on natalie''s
    trips home since the announcement, we have worked together to procure a minister,
    a band, and a tent for the reception. i put down a payment on the beach area of
    our community for the reception. i was even able to find private homes for guests
    to stay to reduce their expenses. out of the blue, last week natalie called me
    and announced that she has changed her mind. she now intends to be married in
    august on the west coast. i don''t want to put a damper on my daughter''s wedding
    plans, but should i just humbly accept this last-minute change? perhaps my vision
    of a wedding as the joining of the bride and groom -- as well as their two families
    -- is an outmoded concept. (our large east coast family will not be able to make
    the trek west.) my natalie is a hypersensitive child, and i am reluctant to tell
    her how disappointed and saddened i am by her sudden change of plans. tell me,

    my husband and i live in a small neighborhood. we are one of about five families
    who have a swimming pool. over the years we have told our next-door neighbors
    they are welcome to use our pool during the summer and while we are on vacation.
    they have two children, ages 6 and 12. we are not close friends, but have had
    them to our home on occasion. they have never reciprocated. last summer, after
    we returned from vacation, our neighbors "laughingly" informed us that they had
    invited two other couples (and their extended families) to our home for a pool
    party. we were shocked speechless. we are entering "pool season" again. these
    neighbors are now waving and becoming friendlier. my husband and i are in firm
    agreement that we will not offer the pool for their family to use again this summer.
    of course, this doesn''t mean that while we are gone they will not invite themselves
    over anyway. what do you think of their behavior? how would you handle this? --

    may is mental health awareness month. in recognition, public service announcements
    have aired on television and radio. one of every five people in america has a
    mental health problem. every 17 minutes, another person will commit suicide. more
    than 70 percent of young people who suffer from mental illness do not receive
    the help they need. as a nation, we have addressed the stigma associated with
    diseases like cancer and aids by expanding our knowledge. we must now apply that
    same knowledge and understanding to mental illness. to accomplish this, we must
    create a climate that not only encourages discussion about these issues, but one
    that also brings mental illness out of the closet and into the realm of physical
    illness. science has shown that mental illness is as treatable as physical ailments,
    and in some cases, more treatable. major depression is treatable in 85 percent
    of cases, while angioplasty -- a treatment for heart disease -- works only 41
    percent of the time. before mental health awareness month ends, won''t you please
    encourage children and parents to talk honestly about mental health and urge them
    to seek help if they have a mental health issue? by doing so, we can begin to
    remove barriers to treatment, eradicate stigma and shame, and ensure that more
    people get the help they need. our goal is to create understanding and awareness,
    and to convey the message that mental illness is no one''s fault. help is available.
    no one should be ashamed or afraid to reach out for it. thank you, dear abby,
    for helping to spread the word. -- nancy rubin, national mental health awareness

    are effective. i told her that slapping a child could cause damage to the eardrum

    we live in a nice, settled neighborhood in a small town. we bought our home 20

    in which some sports equipment was taken from their detached garage, they installed
    a security light. abby, their security light spills over into our back yard. our
    patio and pool can no longer be used at night because of the glare. the light
    also shines into our guest room, both of our bathrooms, through our dining room
    windows into our kitchen and living room, as well as the master bedroom. we are
    forced to use heavy shades or drapes in our home. we''ve done everything to block
    the light, but a guest recently commented that we don''t use our back yard as
    much as we used to. (we can''t because of the bright light.) our guest said he
    had heard many people complain about neighbors'' security lights infringing on
    their property. can you please help us spread the word that before installing
    those beacons, neighbors should consider how such a light will affect the families
    who live on the adjacent property? the neighbors should discuss it together to
    determine if it will adversely affect the lifestyle of the neighborhood. with
    honest communication, perhaps a solution that everyone can live with will come
    to light. we want our neighbors to feel secure, but we want our lifestyle back.

    i have children in a small private school. some of the students always invite
    the entire class to their birthday parties. my children do not. i want my children
    to be empathetic and respectful, but i also want them to grow up learning appropriate
    limits and boundaries. we invite one child for every year of age -- at a fifth
    birthday party: five guests. i offer my do''s and don''ts for children''s birthday
    parties: (1) don''t hand out invitations at school unless you plan to invite the
    entire class. mail them instead. (2) don''t schedule the party immediately after
    school. the partygoers should not arrive at the party en masse off the school
    bus. (3) don''t discuss the party on the playground or in the lunchroom or classroom.
    if one of your guests mentions the party, simply say you''re glad he or she can
    come. school is not the place to go into party details. (4) do ask your child
    to consider the mix of his or her guests. are there two children on the list who
    don''t get along? is there a guest from the neighborhood who will feel out of
    place not knowing the guests from the school? does every guest know at least one
    other guest -- someone besides your child? etiquette isn''t meant to entangle
    us, but to provide guidelines. i hope my children won''t doggedly adhere to strict
    rules of etiquette, but embrace a hospitality that considers the needs of others.
    forcing the unrealistic expectation that we will be friends with everyone diminishes
    the child''s ability to make wise choices and create healthy boundaries. our children
    do not have to be friends with every child in their classroom. but our children
    do have to be respectful of all. -- minneapolis mom'

    i witnessed a situation in a popular restaurant last week. it left me wanting
    to share it, in order to protect other innocent children from possible danger.
    a little girl got up from a table, where she was sitting with her mother and a
    sibling, and headed toward the "unisex" restroom, arriving there just ahead of
    me. she went in, the door closed, and then she came out. i asked her if she was
    through, and she told me that there was someone inside, but the door had been
    left unlocked. i stood with her outside the door, and a man walked out. i was
    shocked. the little girl then went inside, and i waited my turn. the incident
    left me with questions: did the man purposely leave the door unlocked? did he
    expose himself to the little girl? i''m upset with myself for not confronting
    the man, not informing the mother, not reporting it to the management. i know
    if someone had walked in on me, i would have gasped or shrieked or something.

    receiving a diagnosis of a serious medical condition can be confusing and overwhelming.
    because there is more than one "right" treatment for many medical conditions,
    it is important that patients gather information so they can work with doctors
    and other providers to map out which course of treatment to follow. while most
    people want more information, many do not know where to find information that''s
    based on the best scientific research. a reliable resource is now available free
    of charge -- a booklet titled, "now you have a diagnosis: what''s next?" it is
    the result of a partnership between the federal agency for healthcare research

    was divorced twice before we married. there were no children from my husband''s
    prior marriages, and he has no contact with his former spouses. i think we need
    to tell our children about his prior marriages in the next year or two, because
    his older nieces know about the divorces and could tell our children. my husband
    feels there''s no need to tell the children unless they ask us directly. should
    we tell our children about the prior marriages, and if so, at what age? what can
    we say to them so that they won''t be upset or feel insecure because of this family
    secret? please advise. -- what to do in tennessee'

    this letter is for all those women who remain in loveless marriages "for the sake
    of the children" like i did. i wanted my children to have an intact family. i
    said i would leave when my children were grown, but by then my husband had health
    problems, and i had responsibilities. intact family? that''s a laugh. my children
    constantly fight among themselves and are disrespectful to me because that''s

    i was in a relationship with a woman for more than four years. it ended two years
    ago. the hardest part was not being able to see her 7-year-old son, "teddy," anymore.
    during the time we were together, he thought of me as his father. he called me
    daddy, and every day told me he loved me. (his real father has never been a part
    of his life.) to be frank, i miss the little guy more than i miss his mother.
    when we parted, i told teddy i loved him and always would. i think of him often.
    unfortunately, i have had no contact with them since they moved to a different
    state. abby, i recently met another woman. she is very nice, and we get along
    well. she has three kids, ages 7 to 15. i have feelings for their mom, and i know
    she has feelings for me. however, i am unsure about going forward with this relationship.
    i can''t endure loving someone''s kids as my own, and maybe having history repeat
    itself should we break up. i still have not recovered from being separated from
    teddy. i am mature enough to know that you must take chances in life. i also know
    that if i don''t move forward with this, i''ll probably regret it. any advice?

    this is in response to "lee in walnut creek, calif.," whose husband was on 11
    different medications and experienced either drug interactions and/or dosage problems
    that led to increasing disability. my immediate reaction to that letter was where
    was his pharmacist? could it be that the family used several pharmacies and were
    never asked for a complete medication list? however, someone should have asked.
    pharmacists are required by state and federal regulations to counsel patients
    on all new prescriptions. being aware that a patient is taking multiple prescriptions
    should have sent red flags up in the mind of any pharmacist taking care of that
    man. i have been a practicing pharmacist for 30 years. any time a patient takes
    more than eight different medications a day, i start asking questions. often i
    find that some of the medications are being used to treat side effects of other
    medications! then the appropriate solution is to find an alternative medication
    with fewer side effects. poly-pharmacy (the use of multiple medications for one
    patient) can be very dangerous. unfortunately, many pharmacists may be hard-pressed
    to find the time to counsel adequately. also, some doctors view us as police and
    resent our intrusion into their field of expertise. i know doctors who listen
    and doctors who don''t. however, those who always listen are the patients or caregivers,
    because they are the most affected. so i educate the patient and send him or her
    back to the doctor with alternatives and the tools necessary to adequately communicate
    their concerns. it''s the biggest part of my job, and the one i don''t get paid
    for. to answer lee''s question about what happens to patients who have no reliable
    caregiver to look out for them: they enter nursing homes, or -- if the statistics
    can be believed -- they die. it is estimated that more than 100,000 persons in
    the united states die every year because of poly-pharmacy. how do we protect the
    people we care about? ask questions! ask the doctor, the nurse and the pharmacist.
    make a list of all prescribed and over-the-counter medications the patient is
    taking. know what each medicine is for and what it will do. when given a new prescription,
    ask what current medication it replaces. abby, health care will not change unless
    we force it to. as patients we should all expect the best from each member of
    the team who helps us stay well. i hope your readers will make good use of this
    information. -- martha g. mosher, r.ph., seneca castle, n.y.'

    a few weeks before my birthday, my husband took me to a local jewelry store. he
    had me try on beautiful diamond rings and asked me which one i liked best. then
    about a week before my birthday i was watching the shopping channel. they were
    showing cubic zirconia rings. my husband walked into the room and said, "oh, i
    can do much better than that. did i tell you that i went shopping today?" on my
    birthday i excitedly opened my gift and found a bathrobe! i waited all day for
    the little box with the beautiful ring. it never came. my question: was this a
    mean, thoughtless trick to play, or am i being a baby? please answer honestly.

    would be up to me. i am almost 50 years old, have worked at several other companies,

    knowing she had "ruled the roost" in her own home, i asked her to promise me that
    she would remember she was not coming to run our household. well, bless dorothy''s
    departed soul, for 10 years she honored her promise, even though at times you
    could see she was biting her tongue. abby, i just recently retired. my wife and

    why do television and movie directors think they must fill every moment of a show

    when the wonderful nature shows have such loud background music that it''s difficult
    to understand the commentary. what would be wrong with simply hearing the natural
    sounds of nature, like the sea or the forest? many people i know dislike going
    into restaurants because, again, the "background" music level is so high it is
    impossible to converse. and forget about sitting in a movie theater. any sound
    level about 90 decibels does permanent damage to one''s hearing -- yet studies
    show that practically every movie theater exceeds this damaging level by a huge
    margin. ask a theater manager to turn down the volume, and you''ll be told the
    public likes that noise. we are permanently damaging the hearing of our people.

    i am at my wit''s end. i don''t know if i can go on. my mother''s 64-year-old
    sister, aunt "stella," is suffering from pulmonary disease and can no longer care
    for herself. i already take care of my bedridden mother in mom''s home that she
    shares with my children and me, while i hold down a 40-hour-a-week job and single-handedly
    raise my two teen-agers. last evening, mother asked me to take in aunt stella
    and care for her, because she is estranged from the rest of the family and has
    little money. abby, i am ashamed to admit it, but i hate the woman! aunt stella
    is the most self-centered, uncaring person i have ever known. in spite of her
    illness, she is never without a cigarette -- even when others are in the car with
    her. all my life -- even as an infant and small child -- she was forever stinking
    up the air with her smoke. she didn''t (and still doesn''t) care about the safety
    and comfort of others, as long as she gets to smoke her cigs. everyone, including
    my mother, was afraid to say anything to her about her smoking, because she would
    become angry and verbally abusive. (no one was going to tell her what to do!)
    the few times i spoke up (or lowered the car window so i could breathe) aunt stella
    either scolded or slapped me. she was at our place for any and all family events.
    i could not escape her. she was never helpful to my mother or me; just a nuisance.
    i love my mother dearly, as i do my children, and do not want them to experience
    what i suffered all my life. although terminal, my aunt still smokes as much as
    she ever has. mom''s days are short. she is often incoherent, but she does have
    days when she is really "with it," and i do not want her going to her grave knowing
    i did not fulfill her deathbed wishes. however, my fear is that aunt stella would
    live on long after mom passes, and my life -- and my children''s -- would be pure
    hell. i thought i could place her in a home at some point, but i would have to
    sell this place to cover the costs of keeping stella in a facility. do you have
    any ideas, abby? i''ll be watching your column and hoping. thank you for listening.

    mean i don''t have to pay child support?" the judge answered, "yes." he said,
    "then let''s get this over with!" and hastily signed the papers. we never saw
    him again. please, "desperate," do not base your child''s future on how much money

    tuck it away in a savings plan for her son''s education. when the boy gets older,
    he may want special sports equipment or a musical instrument. whether "desperate"
    likes it or not, this man is the child''s natural father. the money she receives
    will show her son that his father cared for him in his way. -- a grandma in arizona'

    my niece married a few months ago. a month before her wedding, i gave her a wedding
    gift of eight waterford goblets in her pattern. because i had purchased them somewhere
    other than where she was registered, i asked her twice if they were what she wanted.
    she assured me that they were "perfect." i also gave her a gift of cash. several
    weeks after the wedding, she sent me a gracious thank-you note. she recently informed
    me that the goblets i had given her were shorter than she wanted. she told me
    the store where she had registered would take them back and give her credit toward
    taller goblets for half the price i had paid. then she asked me to pay the difference.
    abby, i love her dearly. i do not want to upset our relationship. but i am hurt
    that she thinks the gift she assured me was perfect is no longer good enough for
    her. i could pay the difference to save face, but i would be unhappy with myself
    for allowing myself to be manipulated. is it proper etiquette for her to ask me
    to come up with the difference for a more expensive set of goblets than those
    i gave her? -- east coast aunt'

    i read your column daily and have found the questions concerning when to talk
    to children about sex very interesting. i feel it''s up to the children to bring
    up the subject first. if you have made them comfortable talking to you, they will
    expect their questions to be answered honestly. i was working in the kitchen one
    day when my daughter, age 8, broadsided me with, "mommy, how old do i have to
    be before i can have sex?" i took a deep breath and told her not until she found
    a man she really loved and wanted to be her baby''s daddy, because when you have
    sex you could get pregnant and have a baby. she responded matter-of-factly, "you
    could always use the pill." i told her there were other ways, and she said, "you
    could just say no." i praised her and thought the exchange was over when she asked
    if, when her daddy and i were dating, did i ever tell him no? here i copped out
    and told her that was something she needed to ask her daddy. my husband was outside
    and unaware of what was taking place in the kitchen, so he was unprepared when
    his 8-year-old daughter approached him and pointedly asked if, when he was dating
    mommy, did she ever say no to having sex? he and i are on the same page when it
    comes to parenting. without hesitating he answered, "yes, repeatedly." she said
    ok and walked away, discussion over. my daughter did wait for the man she truly
    loved to come along. they now have two beautiful sons. i''m relating this story
    so that young parents will know the importance of listening to their children
    and answering their questions honestly. this holds true throughout their lives.
    you may not always like what you hear, but if you have always been willing to
    listen, they will continue to talk to you. -- happy granny in waldo, fla.'

    of leaving children home alone. while she is justified in her reaction, she apparently
    has no children of her own, or she wouldn''t have made the comment, "how difficult
    would it be to find a teen-ager who would be willing to earn a few dollars to
    be with amber for a few hours after school?" i''ll tell you how difficult it is:
    impossible! as a university instructor, i am in the fortunate position of having
    flexible part-time hours. two years ago, i was offered a full-time position that
    i had to turn down. why? because i couldn''t find anyone to care for my daughter
    two hours a day, three days a week. i sent letters to every high-school counselor,
    community college and university child development department in my area. i offered
    $8 per hour, well above minimum wage. guess how many replies i got? none! guess
    where i live? los angeles. if i can''t find one teen-ager for a few hours a week
    in this metropolis of more than 9 million, i can only imagine how difficult it
    must be for parents who live in smaller cities. thankfully, i had a choice. --

    my husband and i are both seniors, and he just recovered from a near tragedy.
    i am sure it could happen to anyone who takes more than one prescription medication.
    my husband was slowly deteriorating to the point of being unable to take care
    of himself. he was less and less interested in anything; his hands trembled; he
    couldn''t write his name or drive a car; he had difficulty putting two words together;
    he couldn''t remember anything; and his legs were very weak. in short, he was
    ready for a nursing home. he was taking 11 different medications several times
    a day. as his caregiver and the dispenser of his medication, it occurred to me
    that the drugs could be part of the problem. i wrote his doctor describing his
    symptoms and listing all of his prescriptions. without seeing him, the doctor
    immediately eliminated two of them and reduced the dosage of others. within two
    weeks, my husband''s symptoms began disappearing. all of them are gone now, except
    for the weakness in his legs. he''s doing exercises to strengthen them. abby,
    what happens to people who have no reliable caregiver or mentor? who reads the
    list of "possible side effects"? i am sure there are people in nursing homes being
    given the same medications that put them there. please remind your older readers
    not to accept symptoms as "just being part of growing old." -- lee in walnut creek,

    my parents are in their 80s, in moderately good health, and live a modest lifestyle.

    them dearly and look forward to spending time with them. our relationship is sustained
    by mutual enjoyment instead of guilt. they have many old friends and constantly
    make new ones. what is it about my folks that draws people to them? what makes
    them so popular with people of all ages? here''s the answer: -- they listen more
    than they talk. -- they rarely complain about anything. -- they show a genuine
    interest in others by asking meaningful questions without being judgmental. --
    they live in the present, and although they appreciate the "good ol'' days," they
    don''t dwell on them. -- they enjoy young people and recognize that each generation
    has both good and bad. -- they are fun and interesting to talk to because they
    are learning new things and want to share them with us. -- and finally, they can
    laugh at themselves. growing old can be a real grind, but through it all, they
    find a little humor. relationships are a two-way street, and a lifelong endeavor.

    my mother-in-law passed away unexpectedly. my husband, who is the executor, has
    her cremated remains in our home. it was agreed that when all of the children
    and their spouses were ready, her ashes would be dispersed with all of the family
    present. now one of the sisters wants to open the container that holds the ashes
    and scoop some out to be put in trinket boxes for the other sisters. i feel this
    is very disrespectful, and that the container should be opened only once -- when
    everyone is present -- and only when it''s time to disperse all of the ashes.

    i am an educated middle-aged woman who has not worked outside the home since my
    first child was born 12 years ago. my husband, "jack," is a respected physician
    who makes a good living. we have two daughters, ages 11 and 9. jack loves the
    girls and tries to make time for them in his busy work schedule. his career is
    demanding. over the years it has taken more and more from him in terms of time,
    energy and emotions, which is why i have chosen to be at home. jack has given
    up many of the things he used to do for fun and relaxation because he is tired
    all the time. my husband has become an angry, depressed man. he manages to hide
    it at work and functions very well. but when he is home, he is controlling and
    complains constantly. i have repeatedly asked him to see a therapist and consider
    taking an anti-depressant, but he absolutely refuses to do either. he says he
    can manage his problems. he can''t. his constant criticism has killed any feelings
    i had for him. i am not interested in his thoughts or opinions, and i''m certainly
    not interested in having sex with him, which i do to keep the peace. jack says
    he is happy with me and doesn''t want another wife. i am not happy with him and

    my second husband, "peter," is overly protective of my daughter. "joy" is 15,
    very pretty, and popular with both girls and boys. joy has no contact with her
    biological father. she calls peter "dad." the problem is, peter feels that if
    joy kisses or holds hands with a boy, she should tell him (peter) all about it
    right away. i have talked to joy about sex. she understands the facts of life.
    she says she is not interested in sex. she wants to go to college and doesn''t
    want to "end up" with a baby, and have "no life." i feel peter is wrong not to
    trust her, and joy feels the same way. i have mentioned this to friends. they
    say that if he doesn''t trust her, he will lose her respect and she will pull
    away. they have a close relationship now. i hate to see it ruined because he is
    so distrustful. recently, joy had friends over for a party, and she did kiss a
    boy. when peter found out, he had a fit. he claims she lied to him because she
    didn''t tell him right away. joy and i feel it is none of his business. she didn''t
    do anything wrong. i''ve told her she can talk to me any time about anything,
    and she says she will. she also said she thinks it would be better for her to

    i am a 14-year-old girl with a big problem. today, when my father and i went to
    the supermarket, i saw a book that looked interesting. it was called "how to win
    at love." i picked it up not because i was having a problem with my love life
    -- i don''t even have a love life -- but i am curious about "love," so i read
    a few pages and decided to buy it. my dad saw the title and got mad at me. then
    one of my sisters started treating me like i was a freak. now, i''m scared my
    dad and sister will tell my mom, and then mom will be mad, too. my mom has told
    me i shouldn''t have a boyfriend until i''m finished with school. how am i supposed
    to tell her i was only curious? i know they both think i''m too young to have
    a boyfriend, but that''s not it. the book isn''t about guys and marriage. it''s
    about changing yourself and being in charge of your own life. it''s not my fault
    i''m curious about love. it''s because my parents won''t talk about it with me.
    every time i ask something about it, they say, "why do you want to know? do you
    have a boyfriend?" i hate that. what hurts most is knowing if i can''t talk to
    my parents about love, what can i talk to them about? right now, i don''t want
    to talk to my parents about anything! lots of things happen in my life that i
    wish i could talk to my parents about, but i guess i can''t. the only people i
    feel safe talking with are my friends. abby, what should i do about my parents?

    also taken it upon themselves to remove a case and a half of wine from our home!
    several people, including the caterers, saw them take it. this couple also became
    intoxicated and were quite rude to the family and friends they invited to their
    home. my husband and i feel violated. they have never mentioned taking the wine.

    please settle a disagreement between me and my fiance. several of his co-workers
    have had weddings recently, with more to come. it is their practice to invite
    only their co-workers, stressing that no spouses or significant others are invited.
    this is not true of their other guests, only their co-workers. i have heard they
    believe the people from work are not as much fun when their spouses or dates are
    around. all these weddings have been in halls with light buffets or appetizers
    and cash bars. they are always held at night with a dj and dancing. they are not
    formal. my fiance''s co-workers are almost all female. therefore, he''s the only
    dancing partner for 10 to 15 women who are without their husbands or boyfriends.

    he visits. we would like to move our 5-year-old into mike''s vacant room; however,
    mike is absolutely livid about it. he says it is "still his room," and he doesn''t

    have somewhere for mike to sleep when he comes for the weekend, as we have a sofa

    you made some good points in your reply to "used in north carolina," who married
    his pregnant girlfriend and nine years later learned that his son was "not his
    own." this father resented that he was expected to take care of a child "who isn''t
    even mine." however, you missed an important point. because your column is so
    widely read, it''s important to call attention to what it is that really makes
    a child "one''s own." i am a pediatrician. i interact with children from all sorts
    of families day in and day out. from a child''s perspective, what makes a child
    "belong" to a parent is the emotional-psychological bond between parent and child.
    what makes a child emotionally healthy is the stability of that social bond. this
    emotional bond is essential for the child, regardless of biological relatedness.
    for the sake of our children, this cannot be left unsaid. this man is the only
    father that child has ever known. it breaks my heart that he said, "i love this
    boy, but i don''t feel he is my responsibility anymore ... i would like to live
    my life for myself and do what i want when i want, like his mother does." what
    does this "love" he professes mean if it doesn''t mean taking responsibility?
    that boy needs his father. if his mother failed to love him, that''s all the more
    reason why his father should not even consider letting him down. it is, indeed,
    extremely difficult to be a single parent, especially if money is scarce. you''re
    right to recognize his need for support and to connect him to parents without
    partners. but you missed an important opportunity in advocacy for our children
    when you failed to directly call into question his assumption that only biological
    relatedness can make a child "one''s own." love is what makes us belong to each
    other. and love is about responsibility. -- child advocate in north carolina'

    i''m a 27-year-old woman with a master''s degree. i have a great job at an internet
    company. last summer, my closest friends and i traveled to three foreign countries,
    saw four plays, three baseball games, one soccer match and seven concerts. so
    what could possibly be the problem? my family is concerned that i do not have
    a boyfriend. they can''t understand how i can be 27 and unmarried, let alone without
    a "significant other." my father is worried that my "eggs will dry up"; my mother
    "only wants me to be happy." mother calls only to ask if i am dating anyone, and
    when i tell her about my adventures, she always says it would be so much nicer
    with a boyfriend. i know people have more serious problems, but this is something
    many single people deal with, and quite frankly, it is very frustrating. there
    are many more facets to my life than husband-hunting, but my parents aren''t interested
    in anything else. abby, please tell your readers who are parents that a constant
    barrage of relationship questions every time they talk to their child is not going

    to see if we could get some help. she says it''s not necessary because the problem
    isn''t that big. i can''t help but believe that our problem is about more than
    just a question of hunting and fishing. i feel she wants to control me. she says
    she just misses me. she agrees that i spend more time with the family than most

    flirting with erica. i knew what was going on, but i allowed it to happen. just
    once, i thought, maybe a boy will notice erica and see how special she is. maybe
    this time she will get the boy. well, his plan failed. he couldn''t get alexa
    back, so he began spreading vicious rumors about her. (you know, the kind of rumors

    by neighborhood teen-agers. i have heard the screams of a 10-year-old boy whose
    body was 100 percent burned in a raging house fire. i don''t think i need to go
    on. i realize children have different levels of maturity, but we must never forget
    that they are indeed children. how difficult would it be for "concerned mother"
    to find a teen-ager who would be willing to earn a few dollars to be with amber
    for a few hours after school? some states have laws that prohibit children under
    a certain age being left alone. in pennsylvania, the age is 12. if amber were
    here in pennsylvania, the "concerned" knoxville mother would be arrested. please

    the passenger side door of my friend "rodney"''s truck does not close easily.
    a few weeks ago as i left the vehicle, i closed the door, but not completely.
    the locking mechanism prevented me from opening the door to reclose it, so i decided
    to push on it to force it closed. i pushed the door with my posterior and heard
    a ringing, metallic popping sound. i leaned away from it and saw i had dented
    the door with my rear end! rodney had recently paid for two collisions with this
    truck, so i offered to pay for the damage i caused. i got estimates from two repair
    shops, and it will cost close to $1,000 to fix the door. my girlfriend insists
    that it was not entirely my fault, and that i should tell rodney to make a claim
    on his insurance for it. abby, what is your advice? -- watching my assets'

    i am the grandmother of three young boys and a girl. i was a single mother, worked

    your children interrupt when adults are speaking? (2) how much of the conversation
    revolves around the children? (3) do you set aside time for a one-on-one conversation
    with your mother? there are things some older women will not discuss in front
    of children. (4) do you allow your children to "run loose" in the house? (5) do
    your children have any "quiet" toys? the noise some toys make can be nerve-racking
    to older people. (6) finally, when you telephone your mother, how often are you
    distracted from the conversation to answer or yell at your kids? our children

    the letter from "a grandma or a doormat?", whose daughter expects grandma to baby-sit
    for free and not be reimbursed for the cost of snacks, prompts my own. forty years
    ago, i paid my mother $23 per week to watch my two young children nine hours a
    day, five days a week. she even washed their diapers for me. i knew i was getting
    a bargain and was glad to pay. today, i watch my two grandchildren five days a
    week for $20 a day. i do the ironing and pick them up at school. my children let
    me know that they appreciate my efforts. good day care is hard to find at any
    price. the daughter who was reluctant to help pay for snacks is wrong to resist.
    the $10 a week gramma asked is too little. she has to be home every day and cannot
    make other plans. it is a job. finding a baby sitter who will provide the type
    of child care that a grandmother gives is nearly impossible. shame on that daughter.
    she should have been paying since the beginning. -- midwest grandmother'

    the letter from "anxious in niagara falls," in which the writer asked how to deal
    with a false rumor in her workplace, prompted my favorite memory about such rumors.
    twenty-one years ago, i worked as secretary to a highly placed military officer.
    one day, "col. smith" came into my office and said he had something personal to
    tell me -- a rumor was circulating in the barracks that he and i were having an
    affair. the colonel went on to say that he wanted me to hear about the rumor from
    him so i wouldn''t be upset by hearing it elsewhere. he was (and, i assume, still
    is) happily married to a lovely woman. i was, and still am, happily married to
    the finest man i know, whom i love dearly. of course, the rumor was completely
    untrue. the closest we came to an off-duty relationship was living two blocks
    apart in the same neighborhood on post. we socialized in separate circles except
    once, when the colonel held a promotion party at his home and invited my husband
    and me. i asked him how mrs. smith had taken it. he replied that she understood
    completely and was fine. i told the colonel that if she were fine, so was i. we
    mutually agreed that all was well, and felt confident that the rumor would die
    in a short time, which it did. as he turned to leave, i couldn''t resist playing
    the devil''s advocate by asking, "by the way, colonel, did we have a good time?"
    my ability to joke about it set his mind at ease immediately. abby, your advice
    to "anxious" was right on the money. the rumor will die a natural death when the
    gossips in the workplace see no evidence to keep it alive. sign me ... nothing

    my husband and i are friends with a couple who constantly weasel out of paying
    their share when we socialize with them. they''re part of a large group we spend
    time with, as opposed to one-on-one. they have good jobs, new cars, and probably
    more in savings than all of us other couples combined. this couple gets a kick
    out of telling us that they go to happy hour at local bars to fill up on free
    pretzels and popcorn so they don''t have to buy dinner. they also brag that they
    attend parties so they can eat for free. they tell us they don''t like chinese
    food, but when several couples are going out for chinese, they insist on being
    included. when it''s time to order, they share one order of fried rice and ask
    to "try" each of our dishes, which winds up being a full plate of food. when the
    bill arrives, they pay only for their one dish of fried rice. they even joke about
    the fact they had sampled everyone else''s food, and laughingly ask if they should
    pay a part of everyone''s order. of course, no one takes them up on the sarcastic
    offer. the mrs. planned a surprise birthday party for the mister at an expensive
    steakhouse. when the bill arrived, she initiated the breakdown of the bill by
    saying, "now you don''t really have to pay for us ..." well, not only did we pay
    for the "birthday boy"; the birthday party was a free meal at an expensive steakhouse
    for both of them. last month we received an invitation to their house for a holiday
    party. the invitation read, "bring your favorite hors d''oeuvres and beverages."

    outrageous lies. normally i say nothing. but the other day, "sheila," the younger
    girl, told me she was mad at grandma for having taken mommy to court to get custody

    has told the kids a story that makes grandma look like "the bad guy." my husband

    six years ago my mother died. a year after that, our father met a lady, "alice,"

    did not. father has been engaged to this lovely lady for three years with our
    blessing. our brother decided that dad had no right to happiness and has disowned
    the family over "that woman." we have all accepted our brother''s decision not
    to be a part of the family. the problem is, as time has gone on, our father spends
    less and less time with his children and grandchildren -- who all live in the
    same town -- and more and more time with her children and grandchildren. dad now
    knows her granddaughter better than his own great-grandchildren. during the past
    two years, he has spent both thanksgiving and christmas with her children. dad
    and alice show up to spend an hour or two with our side of the family for these
    holidays, and then leave for her children''s home to celebrate. we had mentioned
    very early in the year that our family would like them to join us for at least
    one of the holiday dinners. in short, this is my and my sister''s dilemma: we
    lost our mother, we have lost our brother, and now we feel we are losing our father.

    the way, she was engaged once before but canceled the wedding before the shower.)
    the gifts from the engagement party were never returned -- so now i have given
    two engagement gifts and a shower gift to someone who never got married. which
    leads to another question -- should she ever become engaged again, must i give
    her a third gift? -- confused in west caldwell, n.j.'

    although i''m a longtime reader, i''ve never felt compelled to write until i read
    the letter from "bowled over in california." it''s the one from the prisoner who
    communicated with another prisoner by talking through the toilet bowl. the letter
    disgusted me. i am a female deputy in a county jail in california (probably the
    same one in which the writer is incarcerated). we call that method of communication
    "toilet talking," and it goes on daily in our jail. if we catch inmates communicating
    that way, we give them a "major write-up," because it''s a violation of the rules.
    yes, many an unsuspecting woman (or man) has "fallen in love" in this manner,
    but i''ll bet you won''t find a single couple who have met this way, married,
    and are still together. it is a scam used to get the new, weak and uninformed
    inmate to send mail or money. the overwhelming majority of these toilet talkers
    are already married or tied up with someone else. oh, the lies and schemes we''ve
    heard. if "bowled" has a brain in her head, she will run away from this so-called
    relationship as fast as she can. think about it: would you want to strike up a
    relationship with a person who may be locked up for many months or years (or a
    lifetime)? or would you rather marry a fine, upstanding citizen who will be by
    your side, especially in times of need? most of these guys are ex-cons or have
    been through the system many times. they know how to manipulate. when they get
    out of prison, poor "bowled over" gets used and abused and taken to the cleaners
    before she''s dropped like a hot potato and finds herself alone, pregnant and
    hooked on drugs, with no place to go and no one to turn to. please forgive the
    length of this letter; i could go on and on. if even one new, unsuspecting inmate
    turns her life around because of my letter, then it has been worth my time and
    effort. -- disgusted deputy in california'

    it''s amazing how younger people judge those already well into their later years.
    the following incident happened when i was 91. i''m now 92, and i still go to
    a local gym three times a week, lifting weights to keep my body in fairly good
    shape. one day last year, i noticed a young man of about 30 lifting a bar with
    weights on the ends. i approached him and asked, "how much are you lifting?" "seventy
    pounds," he replied. "mind if i try?" "sure," he said, "go ahead." when i lifted
    the weights as he did, he asked, "how old are you?" "i''m 91," i replied. staring
    incredulously, he croaked, "and you''re still standing?" this gives you some idea

    i just read a column of yours containing a letter from a girl who had been raped.
    she was upset about not being a virgin at her wedding. i was sexually abused as

    the head with a rolling pin, would you consider that your first experience with
    cooking?" abby, that girl is still a virgin. she has not had sex or made love;
    she was attacked, and the weapon was a penis. technical terms do not apply to

    while i usually agree with your answers, i respectfully disagree with your advice

    invitation. you counseled that the appropriate response to this supposed slight

    perhaps the invitation maker made an error and sent them fewer than they had ordered.
    could it be that, being short of the "official" invitations, they sent the more
    casual ones to those they assumed had priorities other than the type of invitation
    they receive? the bride and groom have hundreds of details to deal with, and the

    my ex-wife and i divorced several years ago. after a three-year court fight, i
    was awarded custody of our two daughters. in spite of this, my ex and i are on
    friendly terms. i have remarried and have a stepchild. my ex had a baby by a man
    who is now locked up for two years in a drug rehab facility. she has just informed
    me that she''s planning on moving in with another man and wanted me to know he
    is a registered sex offender. i looked it up on the internet and learned he committed
    aggravated assault on a 10-year-old child. abby, i am concerned about sending
    my girls over to stay with their mother on weekends. i want to trust her judgment,
    but not at the risk of jeopardizing my children. i went to my mom for advice.
    all she could say was, "i know you will do the right thing." i don''t know what
    to do. i want my ex to be happy. maybe this is the soul mate she''s been looking
    for, but i can''t help being concerned about my children''s safety. what should

    i have a beautiful 4-year-old daughter. i have raised her alone, with no help

    and broke up before i knew i was pregnant. he and his family tried desperately
    to convince me to abort, almost threatening me if i kept the baby. four years
    later, my little girl is now saying, "i don''t have a daddy," and weeping about
    it. i tell her that god is her father and he''s my father, too. abby, this guy
    is extremely volatile, spiritually weak, fickle and disrespectful. it took me
    a while to grasp all he was about, and when i did, i left. my daughter has a great
    life, is very grounded, feels safe, has a one-home, one-church family and incredible
    grandparents. i do not want to disrupt her life by bringing a man into it who

    times. right now that''s the least of my problems. i''ve been dating "gordy" for
    two years, and the idea of marriage has crossed my mind more than once. gordy
    loves my kids and they love him, but he says he''s not ready to make the kind
    of commitment that comes with marriage. the kids are not the problem; i don''t
    have custody. i get them only every other weekend and holidays, so it''s not the
    responsibility of taking care of a big family that''s holding gordy back. he says
    he''d be ok with all that. i''m afraid my past three failed marriages bother him.
    all he''s willing to admit is that he''s "not ready." abby, i feel that i am ready.
    should i sit back and give gordy more time, or confront him and give an ultimatum?
    please help. -- confused and tired of waiting'

    while i agree with your advice to "totally in love," i feel there is a bit more
    to say. from personal experience, i have found that if young people (such as his
    13-year-old girlfriend) have an "exclusive" relationship, what happens is that
    she is excluded from the normal passages of youth. i cannot see how what people
    feel at 13 could possibly be what they want at 18, 21, etc. and if the relationship
    does "go too far," then what? two children with a child? that young girl may well
    regret and resent the exclusiveness of the relationship she had when she was young.
    i hope the parents of both these young people help them to see that it''s better
    to allow each other time to grow up before they try to be grown-ups. if they''re
    truly meant to be together, no amount of time will change their feelings for each
    other, and eventually they''ll be able to share life experiences they''ll never
    have in the relationship they have now. i wish them the best. -- an experienced

    my husband, "howard," and i have been married five years. i''m not sure i want
    to be married to him anymore. i haven''t told him i feel this way, but he senses
    "something" is wrong. i''m afraid to bring it up because he has low self-esteem
    and becomes defensive. he fits the profile of a co-dependent person -- and lately
    i feel like i''m his mother. i love howard dearly. he has helped me raise my son.
    but i can''t afford to waste the rest of my life with someone who is so insecure
    that i can''t even polish my fingernails without him saying, "got a date?" this
    is no way to live, and i''m tired of it. the twist to the story is that i attend
    school part time and have become friends with a man i''ll call "gary," with whom
    i am absolutely fascinated. gary is attractive, smart, and knows what he wants
    out of life -- and has a plan to get there. (i keep asking myself, where was gary
    when i was single?) i live in a small town and can''t talk to anyone about my

    my mother passed away three years ago. a year or so after her death, my 67-year-old
    father looked up "enid," an old girlfriend he dated while he was in his early
    20s. she was married, but was happy to meet with him. it didn''t take long to
    rekindle their romance, and as soon as her divorce was final, they were married.
    dad asked her repeatedly how many times she had been married and how the marriages
    ended. enid maintained that there were three marriages; one made her a widow,
    while the other two ended in divorce -- and it was the fault of the husband both
    times. one of enid''s family members has tipped me off that she wasn''t honest
    with dad. there were a total of five marriages and four divorces. what should
    i do with this information, abby? should i let dad go to his grave without ever
    knowing the truth, in order to spare his feelings? should i tell him? i was raised

    thirty-six years ago, i gave birth and placed my baby girl for adoption. the father
    was going away to school and had no interest in me or the child. my parents were
    about to divorce, and my brother was in trouble with the law. i knew there was
    no way i could keep my daughter, so with a heavy heart i signed away my parental
    rights and tried to go on with my life. eventually i married and had a son, who
    is now 32. my mother has since moved in with my husband and me. two weeks ago,
    a call came to the house while i was at work. mom answered the phone. the woman
    calling was looking for her birth mother, and had information that i was, indeed,
    that woman! mother explained all this to me when i got home. as i was becoming
    more and more excited, she gave me the devastating news that she had told the
    woman that i had only one child -- a son -- and that i was not the person she
    was looking for. the caller continued to ask questions, but mother denied all
    of the facts, and finally ended the call by hanging up on her. i am crushed. for
    years, i have hoped for a call like that, but had not searched for my child because
    i did not want to invade her life or the lives of her adoptive parents. my mother
    was extremely judgmental and non-supportive when i was pregnant that first time,
    and the day my daughter was born, she pointed at my baby and said, "she is not
    coming home with us. i am not raising any more children." now i am desperate for
    my daughter to call again. i must find her! i have filed with the state adoption
    registry and private bureaus, called an attorney, and searched online. i pray
    that she will call back, so i can assure her that i love her and have thought
    about her every day since her birth. my husband is anxious to welcome her into
    our lives. we are both heartbroken we may never have the chance. mother has since
    come to understand what a grave injustice she performed -- for a second time.

    i am a senior in high school. i dated this great guy for more than a year. he
    broke up with me a couple of weeks ago, and he''s already seeing another girl.
    i know i will get over this -- but it''s just so hard. i have a class with him,
    and it hurts me to see him every day. i want to get over him, but how? i want
    this hurt to go away. he was my everything. i gave him my all. and now i don''t
    have him. i have no one to turn to. what am i supposed to do? -- depressed on

    i''m worried. i think my niece is abusing her 19-month-old son. i went trick-or-treating
    with them, and saw my niece repeatedly pick him up by one arm and yank him up
    the front steps of houses. she also scolded him for not walking fast enough and
    kept him out until the very end of the evening. the child was completely exhausted
    and crying before his mother would call it a night. my niece is stubborn and difficult
    to approach with suggestions. how can i approach her tactfully? i need to know
    exactly what words to use so she doesn''t get mad and reject the idea. please
    help. -- fearful aunt in carnegie, pa.'

    from time to time, you publish humorous pieces in your column. i hope you and
    your readers will enjoy this one: at the wake, the woman told her priest that
    ever since she was a child, she and her father had discussed life after death.
    they had agreed that whoever went first would try to contact the other. they had
    discussed it again only two weeks before his death. he died in her home, and a
    few hours later, the smoke alarm in her garage went off. she had lived there for
    28 years and it had never gone off before. she didn''t know how to stop it and
    had to call the security company that had installed it. the next morning, the
    smoke alarm sounded again -- and the reason finally dawned on her. she said aloud,
    "ok, dad, i missed the signal yesterday, but i''ve got it now. thanks for letting
    me know you''re safe on the other side. now turn the darn thing off so i don''t
    have to call the security company again!" and it went off! she immediately called
    her priest to relay the good news. his response: "dear, if every time your father
    sends you a message, he sets off the smoke alarm, just where do you think he''s
    calling from?" -- the rev. james blantz, rolling prairie, ind.'

    may i offer yet another cell phone etiquette blooper? my grandfather''s funeral
    was last week. since our family is catholic, we asked a priest to officiate. in
    the middle of the service, a cell phone rang (to the tune of "happy birthday").
    you should have seen the scowls and heads turning. a few minutes later, it rang
    for the second time! at the graveside afterward, we finally discovered who the
    culprit was. during the solemn flag-folding ceremony, the phone rang a third time.
    imagine our astonishment when the priest pulled the offending instrument out of
    his pocket and stepped away to engage in a long conversation. -- still shocked

    i need some advice about my boyfriend. we have been dating for three years. he
    started off our relationship telling me he loved me. about a year ago, he began
    introducing me to everyone as his "roommate." when i confronted him about it,
    he said he didn''t love me anymore. we still live together -- until i move out
    -- and he tells me often that we should stay together because we get along so
    well. i''m confused. what exactly is it that he wants from me? -- tired of being

    my husband, "gil," and i are in our mid-20s and have a small son. we work hard
    for everything we have and enjoy a wonderful life. my problem is my mother-in-law,
    "blanche." gil learned of her drug habit at an early age, and he never had a "normal"
    childhood. now that he''s an adult, nothing has changed. in the past three years,
    blanche has overdosed twice that we know of and can''t hold a job because she
    has stolen from every place she has worked. last christmas while she was visiting
    us, she had the nerve to steal 14 prescription pain killers from our medicine
    cabinet. blanche also owes us about $2,000. the last time she was here, she wrote
    gil a check so she''d have money for the flight home -- then stopped payment on
    it, causing our account to be overdrawn. when our son was 14 months old, he found
    a loaded gun under his grandmother''s couch! thankfully, i was there. needless
    to say, our child is not allowed to visit her without me, and gil is in full agreement.
    however, i would like gil to sever all ties with his mother before she hurts our
    family again. gil is a loving man with a big heart. despite all the pain his mother
    has caused him, he still loves her. blanche feeds off that and always worms her
    way back into his life. abby, is it wrong of me to want my husband to permanently
    cut his mother out of his life? -- anonymous daughter-in-law, norfolk, va.'
