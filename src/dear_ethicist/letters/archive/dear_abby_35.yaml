    i work in a skilled-care facility. i am also preparing for law school. today one
    of my co-workers humiliated me in the presence of others by asking if i have been
    gaining weight. i giggled and said, "probably." she proceeded to say that i have
    gained "a lot" of weight in my "fat face" and told me to get on the scale so she
    could see how much. i told her it''s none of her business. she has done this to

    my wife, "carlene," is a neonatal icu nurse who is required to work a certain
    number of holidays. for the past 12 years, her family has feigned attempting to
    accommodate her schedule and then planned holiday events at the same exact time
    and place as the year before. they have ignored repeated explanations and don''t
    seem to care if we come or not. for example, last thanksgiving they once again
    made a big deal about everyone sending their schedules via email. we responded
    that carlene would have to work until 3 p.m. shortly after, we received a call
    from the host, who said: "we know you can''t make it, but the celebration will
    be at 12 sharp! maybe we''ll see you some other time." abby, my wife feels like
    she is unimportant to everyone. she plans to stop attending all family events
    and celebrate only with me and our daughter. while that would be easier, i know

    my husband and i have three daughters, identical triplets. we, like many parents
    of multiples, are tired of questions and unsolicited comments from strangers concerning
    ivf -- which we did not use, hence "identical" -- or anything else triplet-related.
    i don''t think people realize how rude they are being. i have been asked when
    did i know, how much did they weigh, what are their full names, etc. abby, would
    you please discuss baby etiquette with the world? i do not feel questions about
    my children from total strangers are appropriate. they even make me feel unsafe.

    i have been married for 27 years to a man who is a church pastor. we have had

    my son is a tall, strikingly handsome teenager, although somewhat shy. our problem
    is that his looks attract the wrong kind of attention from aggressive girls, and
    it''s getting worse every year. he and his 14-year-old sister went out to eat
    after school yesterday, and when they returned it was obvious my son was upset
    and his sister was furious. she said a group of college girls at a table next
    to them were teasing and taunting my son with blatantly sexual propositions. they
    went so far as to touch him suggestively as they got up to leave. i''m sure they
    got the physical response from him they wanted; he is only 17, after all. but
    he was clearly angry, embarrassed and ashamed. he said he felt trapped and didn''t
    know what to do. the sexual harassment of young men is often laughed off with
    a wink and a nudge, but it isn''t funny. it can be as painful and damaging to
    men as to women. furthermore, my son is a minor, and i suspect the college girls
    were adults, if the beer on the table was any indication. i am trying to raise

    about her passing, i want you and your family to know you will be listed in my
    prayers in the days ahead. i thought you might be interested to know some of the
    lessons i have learned from reading your column. they are: 1. don''t blame your
    server for bad food. always be polite and send compliments to the chef when applicable.
    2. it''s your wedding; you don''t have to invite "drama mama" and "long-gone dads"
    unless you want to. and do not ignore stepmom. 3. it''s never too late to change
    bad habits. today is a good time to begin making healthy new ones. 4. kindness
    is always important. do it randomly if you must, but do it often. pennies are
    a gentle reminder of heaven. 5. being the other woman is a dead-end job. no matter
    what he says, the odds are he is never going to leave his wife. 6. workplace romances
    are usually doomed. don''t risk it unless you want to find a new job. 7. counseling
    is a good thing. don''t suffer for years or in silence. get some help today. 8.
    reconcile and forgive estranged parents if you can. you don''t have to be dysfunctional
    because they are. 9. pursue that thing you dream of now. you''re going to get
    older anyway. which would you regret more, doing something or not doing it? 10.
    you deserve to be loved. start with yourself, become the best that you can be
    and live until you die. p.s. i just thought of one more: send thank-you notes,
    and no, it''s never too late to do it. -- cynthia b. hopson, lebanon, tenn.'

    my husband and i are contemplating starting a family. when i was younger i wanted
    children, but over the years my personal experiences have caused trepidation.
    because of divorce and the custody battles of my older siblings, i know the amount
    of blood, sweat and tears that go into children. i work in the field of social
    services. every day i am confronted with families who struggle with more children
    than they can care for and with behavioral and emotional problems. frankly, it
    has turned me off. i am terrified of all the "what ifs." i can''t talk to my family
    because i don''t want to tell them they have created part of my problem. my in-laws
    can''t understand why we don''t have children yet. my husband keeps insisting
    "everything will be fine." i love him deeply and he would make an amazing father.
    my heart wants this, but my head isn''t sure. i can''t picture our future without
    children, but the fear of actually having them brings me to tears. can you help
    me? -- scared to take the next step'

    i''m at a crossroads. i have been married for 15 years and have two children.
    i love my wife and have been content with this life for a long time. however,
    for years i have felt like something was missing. i recently become close friends
    with a man who is in the same situation. one day he confided that he is gay and
    has known it for more than 10 years. he told me he, too, had been content with
    his life but had grown increasingly depressed before we met. as our friendship
    has developed i have come to realize that i''m gay as well. it was a struggle
    to finally admit this to myself, but i accept that it''s the truth. my friend
    and i have been exploring our sexuality together, and he says he is happier than
    he has been in years. both of us love our wives and children; however, we desperately
    need to fulfill our own needs as well. do you have any advice on the best way
    to move forward that will have minimal impact on everyone involved? -- in a difficult

    have been through some of the same things i have. should i go through with it
    or not because my friends think it''s a stupid idea? i know i''m not exactly the

    i have just discovered that my granddaughter''s mother helped her get a facebook

    child is only 11, but you''d never know it from the makeup and hairdo in her photo.

    for a life of achievement and happiness are zero. i have little to no contact
    with her because i have been put off by her mother''s "street" attitude. if her
    lips are moving, the woman is lying. my granddaughter is disrespectful and ignorant.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    are hugs the new handshake? i am encountering more and more people who, instead
    of shaking hands when they see you (or say goodbye), want to hug. i understand
    it if you are close friends, but frequently it''s a business acquaintance. the
    two most recent examples were when i went to meet with my mother''s minister to
    arrange her funeral. i had never met the man, but he wanted to hug upon meeting
    me. yesterday, i saw a new eye doctor for the first time. as i was leaving, i
    put out my hand to shake his. he said, "oh, i like to hug!" when i stepped back
    and told him, "i''m not a huggy person," he seemed offended. any suggestions?

    putting in overtime. the other day when i was doing the laundry, i discovered
    a red stain on his underwear. he said they were painting the bathroom at work

    i am retired from teaching high school biology after 39 years. the last year i
    taught, some of my students said i was the "youngest" teacher on the faculty --
    not chronologically, but in the way i talked to them. i treated them as important,
    as equals. being around high school students all those years kept me young. since
    my retirement, i can no longer do the thing i loved best: teach biology. however,
    i am keeping my commitment to staying young. last summer i bicycled 500 miles
    across kansas. i do nine hours of dance exercise and aerobics a week, paint with
    oils, do photography and am starting to relearn the guitar. i may be in the early
    stages of parkinson''s disease, so i want to do everything i didn''t get to do
    when i was younger while i still can. i think too many people are busy being old.
    most of my former classmates and friends have died. many younger people can''t
    do what i do. some of them tell me i should "act my age" and "learn to be old."
    but what i''m doing keeps me young, and if i look silly doing it, so be it. i
    feel more fit now than when i was 21. if i die in an aerobics class it will be
    a lot better than doing it slumped in a chair. what are your thoughts on this?

    i have been married 30 years and have raised four children to adulthood. i recently
    found out my husband has been having an affair with a prostitute from a strip
    club. he paid all her living expenses and promised to marry her. she was 26 when
    it started; he is 56. he told her his wife had run away with another man and that
    he was divorced. when i confronted him, he lied, lied, lied. he wants to continue
    living together and pretend nothing happened. he went to counseling and quit.
    then he went to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with a "mixed personality disorder."
    he says he wants to make up for his mistake with me, but all the while he was
    having unprotected sex. i doubt he''ll ever stop lying to me because he always
    has. i can''t spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder because this
    has happened before, although not to this extent. he said he just "led a double
    life" and he doesn''t want to do it anymore. he admitted he did it because he
    never thought he would get caught. during this long affair, he was brazen, arrogant
    and abusive to me. now he wants to be attentive, but he makes me sick. what do
    i do? -- can''t trust him in new jersey'

    i am a semi-retired widow in my 60s. a few months ago i started spending time
    with a man i work with. we would see each other once or twice a month, strictly

    into an embrace. a week later, the embrace became a passionate kiss. since then,
    whenever we get together -- now once or twice a week -- we spend a good portion
    of our time together "making out." we love the way each other kisses. the problem
    is, we''re still just friends. there is no desire on the part of either of us
    to take the relationship up a notch. what do we do? we should not be kissing a
    friend the way we do, but we can''t seem to stop. we''re not hurting anyone. we

    i have been with my boyfriend, "dan," for almost five years. he''s wonderful and
    we have a great relationship. we have talked about spending our lives together,
    but had mutually agreed in the beginning that marriage wasn''t a priority for
    either of us. he has said for years that he never wanted to marry -- which is
    fine with me. i now suspect that he''s planning to propose to me on our fifth
    anniversary. (he has never been great at hiding surprises.) i''m thrilled that
    he wants to make that kind of commitment, and i want nothing more than to spend
    the rest of my life with him, but the thought of marriage scares me. i don''t
    know if it''s nerves about the pending proposal or that i have never planned on
    marriage and now i have to think about all the stress and strife that comes with
    planning a wedding. i want to say yes, but i love the way things are right now,
    and i know that marriage will change things. what, if anything, do i say to him?

    i''m convinced my father''s wife killed him and i don''t know where to turn. he
    had fought complications from quadruple bypass surgery for a few years, and had
    been in hospice for months prior to his death. my siblings and i didn''t put all
    the pieces together until afterward. although i''m sure dad was killed, based
    on facts and discussions with social workers, i''m pretty sure it was assisted
    suicide, which is illegal in most states, including the state where he lived.
    i feel cheated and angry at my father''s wife for not having the guts to talk
    to us about his plans, and dad for relying on her to tell us when she never had
    a good relationship with any of us. i''m also angry with myself for not stopping
    what i witnessed as it happened before my eyes. how could i have been so blind?
    it has been several years now, and i still feel guilty for letting it happen,

    my sister "mary" was in a car accident when she was in her 20s that left her with

    belligerent. when she was evaluated by professionals years ago, our family was
    advised to set standards for her behavior as near to normal as possible. when
    we go to restaurants, mary has a hard time deciding what to order, often engaging
    the server in an uncomfortable, long conversation about the alternatives. when
    her meal arrives, she is rarely satisfied with her choice and makes a scene over
    her dissatisfaction to the server. if we try to intervene, she becomes even more

    my boyfriend, "doug" (24), and i (22) have been in a long-distance relationship
    for a year, but we were friends for a couple of years before that. i had never
    had a serious relationship before and lacked experience. doug has not only been
    in two other long-term relationships, but has had sex with more than 15 women.
    one of them is an amateur porn actress. i knew about this, but it didn''t bother
    me until recently. doug had a party, and while he was drunk he told one of his
    buddies -- in front of me -- that he should watch a certain porn film starring
    his ex-girlfriend. it made me feel awkward. the next day he apologized. of course,
    having learned her name, i couldn''t help myself from searching for her on the
    internet. now i can''t stop comparing myself to her, and i feel intimidated and
    frustrated. i have been struggling with how to get over it. doug has told me many

    we have always purchased rather than leased our cars. one of them has 225,000

    when it comes time to return them at the end of the lease. because of this, i
    find myself driving more often than i should. one friend attends a weekly meeting

    few days later and accuses us of trashing them. i have seen mourners leave precious
    personal mementos on their loved ones'' graves only for kids to take them as playthings.
    i have seen kids deface grave markers, entertain themselves by bouncing rocks
    off headstones or open up brass and bronze cameos, exposing the photos to the
    elements. the worst is unsupervised kids running off in packs and gathering up

    i have enjoyed a good life. i have served my community. i have a wonderful wife,
    great children and good friends. however, it now appears that the disease that
    has been kept at bay has progressed, and soon my days will end. i have accepted
    my impending death as best one can, and let few people know of it. i would like
    to thank all the wonderful people who have been an important part of my life over
    the years, and i''m wondering how that might be accomplished. i do not want to
    make them sad or receive condolences. i simply want them to know they were an
    important part of my life for which i am truly grateful. i considered a party,
    but wondered if that might seem morbid. letters seem too distant, and phone calls
    would be hard on me. while my death sentence is firm, and it will be soon, the
    exact date is impossible to know. few of these people are aware that i am seriously
    ill, although i have been hospitalized many times. can you give me some suggestions
    to show my appreciation? -- on the way out in new jersey'

    when my 9-month-old grandson, "eli," comes to visit, i become frustrated to the
    point of leaving the room, if not my house. not only must we put away things he
    shouldn''t get into, we must tape shut every drawer and cabinet, block access
    behind couches and chairs to keep eli from electrical cords, then constantly be
    on guard for the "unexpected." eli is never restricted in any way, and would never
    be confined to an "inhumane" playpen for even a few minutes. at the slightest
    whimper, he is picked up. he''s walked to sleep (or taken on car rides to "soothe"
    him), and his parents literally run to him whenever he awakens. i''m reluctant
    to criticize because i know they''ll be offended, but i''m aching to suggest they
    teach the child about limits and restrictions and correct him when he misbehaves.
    let him experience being in his playpen or even allow him to whine a little before
    jumping at his every whim. we''re not allowed to say "no-no" -- the preferred
    response being to distract eli and let him go about doing as he pleases. by the
    way, both parents are professional psycho-babble people. am i unreasonable to
    think my grandson is capable of learning limits with a simple "no-no" and, perhaps,
    a little smack on his hand? or should i keep my mouth shut? -- well-meaning grandpa'

    when i was 12, my family moved to new jersey. it was a difficult time in my life.
    lucky for me, i made a best friend across the street, "janie." we spent all our
    time together. i loved being at her house because it was a happy one, unlike my
    own home. (my mom was erratic and unhappy, and it affected our whole family.)
    a year later, janie learned her family would be moving to ohio. i was devastated.
    the day the moving truck came, janie and i were inseparable. the driver was a
    young man in his 20s named randy. when janie and her family left in their car,
    i sat on the curb outside my house sobbing. when the loading crew finished, randy
    started the truck, then turned off the engine. he got out and came and sat beside
    me on the curb and told me how someday my pain would lessen. he said i was a special
    person, and shared a little about his own family who was far away. then he took
    a ring off his finger and said he wanted me to have it. it was a marines ring
    his grandfather had given to him. he insisted i take it, gave me a hug and drove
    off. when i went into my house and my mother saw the ring, she said, "what did
    you do to get that?" it made me feel dirty and i didn''t understand why. so i
    sent the ring to janie and asked her to please return it to randy, which she did.
    in the years that have followed, that man''s generosity and compassion have stayed
    with me. it helped me to believe in myself when things in my family seemed dark.
    since then, when i have seen people who were hurting, i have tried to do what
    randy did -- make them feel better. sadly, i have never known how to find him
    to thank him. randy: wherever you are, please know how much of a difference your
    kindness made in my life. -- still grateful in texas'

    most people recognize chest pain as a symptom of heart attack, as well as pain

    i want to ask your opinion about something. i work at a donut shop inside a college
    campus. i have a tip jar, and many customers are generous and share their change
    with me. my problem is other people who feel entitled to the money in my tip jar.
    there have been instances when some of them realized they were a few cents short,
    so they stuck their hands in my tip jar and fished out the coins they wanted.
    it is not out of ignorance! the jar is clearly labeled "tips -- thank you." if
    i tell them they can''t take the money, they get angry. one lady screamed at me,
    saying i was "selfish," and the money in the jar shouldn''t be just for me! what
    do you think, abby? am i too upset over a few cents? or am i right to feel robbed
    and stand up for myself when people do this? -- doing my job on campus'

    i''m two months pregnant with my second child. our first child is a boy. my problem
    is my mother. she loves her grandson dearly, but she''s desperate for a granddaughter.
    recently, the subject of names came up. although we have already decided on a
    name if the child is a boy, we had not discussed girls names at length. when mother
    asked me what the girl''s name would be, i said i had always liked "melody," and
    that if i had my way, that is what i''d name a girl. my mother immediately started
    knitting an afghan with the name melody on it. a week later, my husband said that
    while he didn''t mind the name melody, he thought we should decide on a name together.
    i tried to tell mom that melody might not be the name we choose. her response
    was, "well, my granddaughter will always be melody to me." mom and i are very
    close, but she can be extremely stubborn. what''s the best way to tell her we

    i was a busy wife, mother and grandmother who had always been active and involved
    in my church and community. when my beloved husband died three years ago, everything
    changed. i became so consumed by grief, all my regular activities suddenly meant
    nothing to me. my children and grandchildren were busy with their own families
    and careers. i missed having someone to talk to and began feeling deeply lonely,
    even in a crowd. then something remarkable happened: i learned i have an incurable
    cancer. i was so scared and worried, i couldn''t eat or sleep. one of my sons
    took me to a world-famous cancer center. everyone i met there was loving and kind,
    and radiated positive feelings. once again, i felt surrounded by love -- and it
    changed my outlook. i was able to return to my hometown for further treatment
    in a cancer center here, and i return to the larger center for follow-ups. now
    i have the best of two worlds -- a world-famous cancer center a plane ride away,
    and the ability to sleep in my own bed at night. i also have people in two centers
    who treat me with love and respect. community and church members are rallying
    around me to show their support. i feel blessed and content, and the best part
    is i am no longer afraid. abby, what do you think about my change in attitude?

    my daughter was recently married. my niece -- a talented artist -- hand-painted
    flowers on wine glasses for the dinner reception following the ceremony. they
    were intended to be keepsakes for each of the adult guests. the glasses turned
    out beautifully, and made each place setting extra special. i knew they''d be
    treasured by our family for years to come. at the end of the evening, i gathered
    four glasses from our family''s table, then glanced at the bridal table of eight
    -- as some guests approached to offer thanks for a fabulous evening. when i turned
    around, the four glasses were gone. not only had glasses disappeared from our
    table, but also from the head table and from my niece''s (the artist). those of
    us who had worked hardest on the wedding were left with nothing -- and that includes
    the bride and groom. the following day, someone mentioned to me that they had
    seen certain guests leave with four to six glasses each. one woman even had her
    child, who was loaded down with glasses, make several trips to her car. we''ve
    figured out who the culprits were: some out-of-towners who stayed at the home
    of one of the groom''s relatives. i heard that the glassware covered the entire
    top of their dining room table. my question: should we ask these people to return
    the glasses? thanks for your input, abby. -- mother of the bride in mesa, ariz.'

    please allow me to share a dating technique with your readers that has saved me
    a lot of relationship headaches. i call it "the 90-day rule." whenever i start
    dating someone, i try to see them at least once a week for 90 days. that way,
    if there are any character flaws, i find out within the first 90 days. among the
    flaws i''ve discovered: drug dealing and addiction, alcoholism, driving without
    a valid license and with illegal license tags, and lying about their occupation.
    the idea is to avoid sexual intimacy during those first 90 days to keep your head
    clear. if you are intimate too soon, you''ll find yourself making excuses for
    your partner. this technique has never failed me -- unless i made an exception.
    may i suggest your readers try this 90-day rule? if they do, i promise they won''t
    be disappointed because it takes time to get to know someone. before you can love
    someone, you must learn who that person really is. -- clearheaded in clearwater,

    to hurt her feelings, but my wedding will be a small, private affair, and her
    presence would be painful and disruptive to me and another bridesmaid who recently
    had a similar experience with her. colette may not be burning with desire to come
    anyway, given our falling out, and hasn''t yet incurred any of the expenses or
    spent any of the time and effort associated with being a bridesmaid. i don''t
    want to act unkindly, even though i don''t plan on rekindling the friendship.

    my mother had to be placed in a nursing home a year and a half ago. it has been

    this is in response to "had it in hartford" (oct. 6), who has been unhappily married
    to her husband for 20 years. she said she married him for all the wrong reasons
    and "has never loved him the way a woman should love a man." after i had been
    married for seven years, i went to my pastor concerned that the grass on the other
    side was looking greener than mine. as we spoke, i began to realize the extent
    of the investment i had put into my marriage and that i didn''t want to start
    over again on a new one. my mom always told me, "marriage is not easy. you will
    always have to work on it. there will be times when you won''t feel that you like
    him or love him." i have been married for 36 years now. do i notice handsome men,
    or appreciate a man who treats me kindly? of course. i''m not blind or dead. love
    isn''t just a feeling, but a choice and a commitment. i''m committed to my husband
    not because i''m "supposed" to be, but because i choose to be. it seems to me
    that "had it" never made that choice or worked toward it, but expected it to just
    happen eventually. she has a foundation of trust and friendship that helps a marriage
    through the rough times. many marriages that end in divorce rely on sexual attraction
    and passion to carry them instead of friendship. we''re told that marriage is
    50-50. that''s not true. it''s 100-100. i''m responsible for my 100 percent, and
    my spouse is responsible for his. "had it" should take another look at what she''s
    about to lose and tally up the costs to her family. is she really trapped? or
    has she just been unwilling to choose to love? -- barbara in mount vernon, wash.'

    my husband is now involved in his third computer affair. he''s a teacher, and

    me and to his supervisor, said it was an "error in judgment" and promised it would
    never happen again. last week i found an email he had sent to another former student,
    and the things he said to her were disgusting. the current one is a student, too.
    i have a nice home and my husband is good to me except for his wandering eye.

    fired. he''s a brilliant man and an excellent teacher. so what do i do? i have
    considered doing nothing, and if he gets caught let him suffer the consequences.

    you mentioned in a recent column that few people write to follow up on what happened
    since their original letter was published. you printed mine april 1, 2001. i am
    "hurting in houston," the son who, with his partner, was suddenly no longer welcome
    in his parents'' home after they moved to a retirement community, because they
    were afraid their neighbors would shun them if they discovered they had a gay
    son. you advised that i should live my own life and, maybe, someday they would
    come around -- and that is what i did. after a number of years, i received a call
    from a sibling informing me that my father was ill with only a short time left,
    and i should fly to their city to see him. i asked if i was wanted, and he said,
    "it doesn''t matter, just come!" so i swallowed my pride, flew there and made
    my way to the hospice house. although my mother received me well, dad did not,
    and we never had a good moment before he died a few days later. i told my mother
    i was staying for the funeral whether she liked it or not and had my partner fly
    in. after the service there was a gathering at my mother''s house with all their
    friends. i introduced my partner to them and everyone was as kind as could be.
    many mentioned their own gay siblings or relatives. when the event was over, my
    mother said, "wow, this has all been pretty silly, hasn''t it?" it was such a
    colossal understatement that i could not find words to respond. ten years have
    passed; my mother is now in hospice care with only a short time left. we have
    built a great relationship, and she loves my partner of more than 20 years very
    much. we are glad to be able to be there for her. much has changed in the world
    over these years and the acceptance of gays has been remarkable, but for me, having
    these last years with my mother''s love will be a comfort i can hold onto for
    the rest of my life. i have no great moral here, i just wanted to let you know
    what has happened. thank you, abby. -- no longer "hurting in houston"'

    and raking leaves and disposing of them in the fall. in addition, during the months
    before their visit, my daughter is setting aside and freezing small portions of
    entrees so we will have future dinners from her meals. she also freezes an assortment
    of different soups in zip-lock bags, laid flat so they will fit well in my freezer.
    while they''re here, they cook all the meals and do the cleanup. what a wonderful
    gift! even if some families don''t cook, they could make up small meals with deli

    i am divorced after a 38-year marriage. the divorce was the result of an affair
    my husband had. needless to say, it was -- and still is -- very painful. the betrayal
    almost killed me. i have been seeing a therapist who has helped me immensely,
    but i wonder if i will ever fully recover from the hurt. my ex has started a new
    life with this woman, who is almost 30 years younger than we are, and he acts
    like, "oh well, it''s over." even though i have moved on, starting a new life
    at 60 wasn''t easy. is it unreasonable to still have lingering pain and anger
    as a result of the lies and deceit i experienced from a man i loved and trusted?

    i have a friend with one annoying habit. whenever we have a party, she''ll invite
    friends without asking first, or by saying, "i told them it was ok to come." it
    creates a problem because we plan our parties for a certain number of guests,
    and now there are two, three, sometimes even four more -- often on short notice.
    i like her friends, but they are not close friends of mine. sometimes i just would
    like to have an intimate gathering with four to six people. at my last gathering
    she invited not only her friends but also their children. it went from an intimate
    brunch for six to a party of 12. we even had to set up a second table. how can
    i get her to stop, short of not inviting her to any more of our parties? i feel
    stuck in a situation that no matter what i do, i''m going to p.o. somebody. any
    suggestions? -- party planner in georgia'

    last weekend some family members were at my mom''s house for a meal. my 6-year-old
    son and my cousin''s 4-year-old daughter were playing in the room my mom had set
    up for the grandkids. when i went to check on them, i noticed the bathroom door
    was closed, so i knocked. my son answered, sounding rather panicked. i asked if
    "jenny" was in there with him. he said no, then opened the door, but he looked
    scared, as if he knew he had done something wrong, and glanced nervously at the
    closed shower curtain. sure enough, there was jenny, standing in the tub with
    her bathing suit around her ankles trying to get it back on. i told her to put
    her clothes on and took my son outside to speak with him. "rory" admitted they
    were showing each other their private parts and had touched and rubbed them. i
    asked him why and where he learned how to do that, and he implied it was his idea!
    abby, he has never seen any adult movies, magazines, love scenes, or caught me

    thoughtfulness," and ways to close like, "i hope to see you again soon." she gently
    reminded me that the sooner i wrote, the easier it would be to express words of
    gratitude. she also made a deal with me: if i quit complaining and procrastinating,
    she''d address them for me until i turned 18. when i turned 18 she gave me an
    address book filled with the addresses of our family and friends, beautiful new
    stationery and a book of stamps. in case you''re curious, my 18th birthday gifts

    my folks are in their mid-70s and have health problems. my oldest niece, "riley,"

    what we call walking the dog and exploring the nearby field). nos. 4, 5 and 6
    -- go to the bank, get the car washed, then go to the park to swing, slide, etc.
    after the park, she asked if we could go to our favorite restaurant across the
    street. i replied, "how did you know that was next on the list?" her expression
    was priceless. after lunch we went home and did no. 8 -- another adventure, which
    was take the dogs for a walk again. no. 9 was painting time (what 5-year-old doesn''t

    for the past year and a half, i have worked a full-time and a part-time job while
    attending school. i recently graduated from college and now have a career that
    has put me into a better financial position. my problem is, i''m still working
    my part-time job. my boyfriend, "jared," and i get into arguments over whether
    or not i should keep it. i enjoy the extra cash, but i''m starting to feel like
    life is passing me by because i''m working seven days a week, usually 10 hours
    a day. i am exhausted, but jared doesn''t want me to quit. jared doesn''t seem
    to understand that i feel left out when i work this much. i don''t have time to
    see my family or visit friends, something i feel he takes for granted. should
    i keep this job and keep jared happy, or stand my ground and live life my way?

    i am in a quandary over a situation i don''t have any legal rights over. a friend
    of mine has two grandchildren. the mother of the children is neglectful. she didn''t
    take them to a pediatrician for two years. my friend baby-sits all the time and
    the kids know that she loves them, but she can''t take care of them full time
    because she has health issues. i think child protective services needs to know
    what''s going on with these kids. the little boy is very mean to animals and he''s
    not yet 5. if cps is called, they will take the kids away and put them in foster
    care that may be worse than what they are currently in, but without the love from
    their grandma. is there any way to help these children without causing more emotional
    trauma to them and their grandma? -- concerned in texas'

    my parents just informed me that they have not been practical about their finances.
    i suspected it based on the ratio of their salaries to their purchases, but it
    was confirmed during a conversation in which they said they have saved nothing
    for retirement. more disappointing, they both had advantages that would have set
    them financially for life had they been smart with their money. on the other hand,
    i save religiously, and i''m on my way to building the retirement i want for me
    and my wife. i feel bad for my parents, but i can''t help worrying that everything
    i am working for is being threatened by their poor choices and unwillingness to

    my father is dating a woman who is not only my ex-boyfriend''s mother, but also
    the woman he cheated on my mother with and left her for. i don''t want to be around
    her and have told my father this, but he doesn''t accept or respect my feelings.
    being around them causes stress on my marriage because my husband doesn''t want
    to be around her either, and we don''t want her around our children. this is causing
    so much stress that at times i''m afraid it could end our marriage. when i try
    to talk to dad about this, he acts like there is no reason for me to be uncomfortable
    and blames my husband for these feelings. it''s like he completely denies that
    there is any way i could feel the way i do, even though she has brought nothing
    but negativity into my life. i don''t know what to do. i want to still have a

    her boyfriend for two years -- about as long as she has been with him. i know
    this because the woman he has been cheating with is someone i know. last week,

    my parents immigrated here from a foreign country 20 years ago. although they
    speak some basic english, they have yet to become even remotely fluent in the
    language. as a result, they are always asking me to do everything for them --
    pay their bills, file their taxes, go with them to doctors'' appointments, translate
    for delivery people and take my mom on errands because she doesn''t drive. i am
    irritated. when will they learn english? i am the child, not the parent. i feel
    like i have been a mini-adult for many years as their personal chauffeur, secretary,
    interpreter, etc. i don''t mind doing occasional favors for them, but enough is
    enough. what should i do? -- beyond frustrated in chicago'

    i am five months pregnant with my second child and engaged to a wonderful man,
    "tony." we get along well with my ex-husband with whom i share custody of my first
    child. but problems may arise when the baby is born. i had a night of sex with
    a friend who is of a different race. tony knows about it and the possibility that
    the baby will be mixed. he feels strongly that he will help me raise the child
    as his own. my family knows nothing about this, nor does my ex. how should i handle
    the possible backlash and confusion if this child is, indeed, the product of my
    one-night stand? -- scared in the south'

    my girlfriend, "donna," and i have been together for eight years. we have a great
    relationship, respect each other and never argue. she has a low-paying job, and
    i don''t ask much of her in regard to rent or other bills, but she does buy a
    few groceries now and then. i have always told donna that if she ever needs money,
    all she has to do is ask me and i''ll help with what i can. my dilemma is that
    she "borrowed" about $50 in change i had been saving in a coffee can and didn''t
    tell me. when i asked her about it, she said she''d put it back. that was more
    than a month ago. am i being petty? i''d hate for this to become an issue between
    us. should i say something again, or just wait to see what donna does? -- shortchanged

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    "surfing in petersburg, ill." (june 17) raised good points about men who use online
    dating services. however, many of the things she pointed out could also be said
    of women who put their ads on the sites. the pickings are just as slim on our
    side of the fence. my hints to the "fairer sex": (1) don''t overdo your makeup
    and hair in your photos. while some makeup can enhance a lady''s look, we aren''t
    seeking someone who looks ready to go trick-or-treating or perform as a clown
    in the circus. (2) decent men don''t want to see all of your physical attributes
    on these sites. dress appropriately for your age and don''t allow the "girls"
    to burst out of your low neckline. (3) don''t start your first conversation with,
    "what do you do and how much money do you make?" intelligent men will realize
    that you are not as concerned with finding a quality guy as you are with looking
    for a fat wallet. (4) you don''t have to speak perfectly, but the teen lingo and
    texting abbreviations are a real turn-off. (5) don''t constantly complain about
    your ex. it provides insight as to why he opted to break off your relationship
    or file for divorce. -- dan in ohio'

    for women who post photos of their pets, it''s great that you love them, but i''m

    i lost my sister in a brutal murder several years ago. i was too emotionally upset
    to view her body or go to the trial. as a result of not having been physically
    connected to her passing, i have lacked closure all these years. i believe i am
    finally ready to face the reality and deal with it now. as part of the process
    of moving on, i would like to say goodbye to her at the last place i remember
    her living, which is the house she spent so much time and effort on and where
    she was murdered. the house sold shortly after it was listed. i can''t conceive
    of imposing on the new owners with my own "issues," so i do not intend to knock
    on the door and explain who i am. i am wondering, however, about the appropriateness
    of leaving a basket of my sister''s favorite flowers on the front porch in her
    memory. i feel like i need to leave something for her. if this would be all right
    to do, would a note to the effect of wishing the house and its owners a new beginning
    be the thing to do, or not including a note at all? i''m at a loss. -- lost in
