  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i often have thought about cooking food and taking it to neighbors when they experience
    a death in the family or a new baby, etc. i know when my parents passed away,
    kind relatives and neighbors brought us so much food we didn''t know what to do
    with it all. but it was greatly appreciated and helped us more than they could
    ever know. my problem is i tend to overthink this and then not follow through.
    (what if they don''t eat meat? what if they''re on special diets? what if they
    already have a lot of food or are allergic to something?) how can i offer something
    useful without knowing their eating habits? i have considered giving a restaurant
    gift card, but that doesn''t seem as personal. it seems years ago people never
    put so much thought into making a dish and taking it to the neighbors. can you
    give me some insight? -- wants to help in michigan'

    all children are beautiful to their parents. my three children are of mixed race
    and get a lot of attention because of it. the boys are aloof about random compliments
    they receive from strangers. however, i''m worried about the pressure it may put
    on my daughter to be "pretty." i care more about my daughter''s character than
    her looks, but i''m concerned that if i say that to these people, it will come
    off as rude. also, i don''t want her to think i don''t think she''s pretty. how
    can i respond in a way that isn''t rude to well-intentioned strangers, but at

    isn''t the rule of etiquette that when a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient?
    my mother sends gifts to our infant daughter. she is the first grandbaby, and
    my mother is a doting grandparent. my question is what should happen when my child
    outgrows the items -- clothing, shoes, toys, etc. my mother expects me to put
    them all in a storage bin and return them to her. there have been times when i
    have packed up things to give to friends who have younger daughters than ours,
    or taken them to a resale shop. my mother then becomes upset that i''m not returning
    the items to her. she is saving them for my sister, who isn''t even pregnant yet.
    while i have no issue with saving some things for a potential niece, my friends
    need these things now, and i feel strange essentially being obligated to return
    them. is my mom out of line? it''s off-putting to receive a gift that comes with

    him. we established that we both liked each other months ago, but we''re still

    because our furniture is custom, the process can take up to an hour. some associates
    have stayed as late as 8 p.m. to work with a customer who walks in without an
    appointment. when is it appropriate to let the customer know we are closing and
    they should come back at another time for their consultation? we try to work with

    i''m writing about the letter you printed from "excited in maryland" (aug. 16),
    whose wife makes snide comments about his impending retirement. that milestone
    is the biggest, scariest life change people make -- a time marker like no other.
    with many people, our identity is tied to our careers. in my case, i enjoyed a
    long, successful career as a social worker, counselor, teacher and mother. i wasn''t
    the primary breadwinner and was able to work less than full time. when i retired
    seven years ago, my day was my own, with little accountability to my husband.
    i had quiet when i wanted it, music of my own choosing, ate when and what i wanted
    -- and complete privacy all day, every day. my husband, one of the nicest men
    i''ve ever known, retired two years ago, and i still haven''t come to terms with
    the fact that he''s home all the time. he doesn''t ask me to do anything differently,
    but he''s here, which means my definition of privacy has changed. i realize how
    lucky i am to have him, our long marriage, our health, our kids and financial
    stability. i just need a predictable block of time i can depend on to have the
    house all to myself. that letter writer''s wife may be worried about the huge
    change that is coming. my husband has enough interests, hobbies and projects that
    he''s always busy, but we are different people. he can get lost in his project
    while i''m "on alert" for any interruption, real or imagined. a couple of my friends
    have decided to postpone retirement because they don''t want to be home all day
    with their husbands. they are both mental health therapists, but they can''t talk
    with their husbands about it. if they can''t, then who can? this seems to be the
    most major life challenge yet, but i can''t find anyone who''s willing to discuss
    it. is there anyone out there to honestly help us negotiate this phase? -- liz

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my granddaughter, "becca," just turned 6. one of her favorite things to do is
    role-play, which includes the prince (me) kissing her, sometimes at the end of
    a wedding ceremony. becca also likes to sit on my lap. my wife thinks i shouldn''t
    allow her to sit there and that the interaction isn''t appropriate. she says i
    may be mistaken for some kind of predator. it hurts me and becca when i tell her
    we must find some other playtime scenario. i think it''s harmless. who''s right
    here? my wife or me? is there an age a granddaughter reaches when this kind of
    interaction becomes taboo? what about giving her a goodbye kiss when she departs?

    i''m a mostly happily married wife and mother. i love tattoos. when i was younger,
    i was engaged to my soul mate. his name is tattooed on my wrists in honor of the
    love we shared. unfortunately, he was killed in a car accident. several years
    later, i met and married my husband, "brett." when we fight he brings up the tattoos.
    he says they''re "disrespectful" of him and i should get rid of them. it upsets

    i''d like to know if there''s any way to stop my mother-in-law from inviting herself
    to every birthday party and graduation our children have. they are pre-teen and
    teenagers now. she has done this for years, and it often doesn''t end well. because
    they are older, they prefer to hang out with their friends, do sleepovers, etc.
    because she insists on staying the night, it''s hard to have room for sleepovers.
    she complains if she has to sleep on the couch, and she also has a fit if she''s
    not getting enough attention from the kids because they''d rather be with their
    friends and not her the whole time. i have tried explaining that she should come
    the weekend before or after, but she shows up on the birthday anyway. her complaints

    a year ago, i ended a turbulent five-year relationship with my boyfriend, "alex,"

    our daughter, "meghan," spent months in the hospital before she was healthy enough
    to come home, and alex''s family visited only a few times. i have tried to resolve
    the issues with alex''s family so our daughter can have a relationship with them,

    birthday or christmas, but they spend no time with her. they have other grandchildren
    in other states that his mother drives hours to see, but she won''t drive five
    minutes to see my daughter. i''d like to start rejecting the gifts they send meghan
    with a note explaining why. i find it disturbing that they''ll spend money on

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    would you like to know how my mom reduced the stress of thanksgiving on our family?
    my siblings all live locally, so holidays became more and more complicated as
    they tried to plan around both sides of the family and start family traditions
    of their own with their kids. mom solved the problem by moving our thanksgiving
    celebration to the sunday before. that way we had saturday to prepare, didn''t
    have kids asking all morning when we were going to eat and didn''t have to compete
    with a football game. mom put the turkey in the oven on sunday morning before
    we went to church, and an hour after we got home it was ready to eat. my folks
    and single siblings let people know they were available on thanksgiving day and
    were invited to the homes of other family or friends. as mom grew older, the gathering
    became a potluck and other relatives were invited, including the in-laws who were
    not available on thursday. -- carrying on the tradition'

    nick began the transition, i have seen him three times. last week when i was visiting,
    i accidentally called nick by the wrong pronoun, "she" instead of "he" a couple
    of times. i was either immediately corrected or ignored until i realized i had
    used the wrong word. it hurt my feelings. after i got home i sent nick a text
    to apologize and explain that it would take time for me to get used to saying
    "nick" and referring to him as a he. i told them their correcting me bothered
    me. all weekend i could tell they were irritated with me, and i felt it was uncalled

    in a recliner in the den. the 2-year-old usually sleeps with her. sometimes he
    sleeps in a crib in our room. i sleep by myself in a king-size bed. there is no

    my 10-year-old daughter and i enjoy hosting sleepovers for her friends from school.
    over the last few years, her circle of friends has increased, as have the dietary
    needs of said friends. it went from simple meals like macaroni and cheese, pizza
    or hamburgers to parents requesting gluten-free cookies, soy milk, almond milk,
    and other demands that drive me crazy. i''m willing to accommodate to a point,
    providing vegetarian options and no nuts, but for parents to demand that i spend
    (what seems like) hundreds of dollars on food my family and i never eat is insane.
    the last time this happened, i asked the parent -- nicely -- to provide a small
    container that i could store in my fridge for the girl to use for her soy milk.
    the woman became irate, called me thoughtless and wouldn''t let her daughter come!
    i don''t know what i did wrong, but apparently i made some faux pas because the
    same thing happened with a different girl who wanted gluten-free everything. abby,
    what should i do or say in these situations? i usually provide snacks and such
    that fit most diets, but a lot of times the main course contains gluten, dairy,
    etc., and i don''t want to go broke buying select types of food for one kid. --

    this doesn''t bother me, although many of my close friends joke with me about
    being a "50-year-old virgin." my problem is, four years ago i lost my job. i have
    a few investments and a small inheritance that, when combined, give me an income
    of $60,000 a year. so i don''t need more money. although i did look for another
    job for two years, i haven''t tried for the past two. i tell my friends i''ve
    decided to retire. they keep telling me i need to find a job because i need something
    to keep me busy. i remind them that i have enough money for everything i need.
    friends have started telling me i may have a "problem" and should think about
    counseling. i see no need for it, but have decided to get an outside opinion.
    so, abby, should i see a counselor about my lack of interest in finding a new
    job? -- out of work in texas'

    my dear friend "iris" is having her annual halloween party. each year i wear a
    costume i pull together without spending extra money. this year i''ll be dressing
    as a cowgirl, and i have arranged to borrow a few items for the costume. as a
    rule, i keep my costume a surprise and don''t ask others what they''re going to
    wear. by chance, iris and i ran errands together and she wanted to pick up her
    husband''s costume while we were out. she chose a cowboy costume. i considered
    changing my costume, but then i started wondering why i should, when i had already
    made arrangements. before iris paid for the costume, i told her about mine. she
    put her husband''s costume back and said she''d select something else later. there
    was no argument, but i wonder if i was obligated to tell her. would it have been
    bad if i had just gone ahead and shown up as a cowgirl without saying anything?

    i have been with my husband, "elliot," for six years, married for two. we''re
    financially stable and have great, supportive families. one of our biggest issues
    is that elliot needs to be emotionally coddled, and i give in to it. it''s taxing
    to be the strong one all the time, and the result is i don''t feel as attracted
    to him. he complains that i''m "not fun" anymore or that i''m a "prude." now that
    i''m pregnant, things have gotten worse. i expected to be treated like a pregnant
    goddess, but elliot feels no emotional attachment to our baby and is afraid of
    becoming a father. i find it hard to deal with because we planned this pregnancy.
    we have been fighting a lot lately, and while he was out, i read his journal.
    it stated that he knows he doesn''t love his wife anymore. since that day i have
    been a wreck, but i have been unable to talk to him about it. every morning he
    tells me he loves me. now i ask him, "are you sure?" to which he replies, "of
    course!" is he lying? should i confront him about the journal entry even though

    my daughter''s elementary school has many fundraisers each year where the children
    are asked to sell things like takeout pizza coupons and cheap wrapping paper to
    raise money for schoolwide events. i''m happy to support the school, but do not
    want her to participate in the selling. she''s too little to go door-to-door or
    make phone calls on her own, so i end up doing it for her. i am very uncomfortable
    when individuals ask me to buy things. i don''t want to put that kind of pressure
    on other people. also, some of the items for sale are unhealthy or not things
    we''d use, so it seems wrong to ask others to buy them. instead of selling, where
    they only get a small portion of the funds, i''d rather donate directly to the
    school. however, i''m not sure how to do that without making our family stand

    ask the teacher or pta member how much our share is and then write a check? i''m

    our family dog recently passed away after a year-long decline. i had grown up
    with him. he had reached the point where he needed daily care for his body, even
    though his mind was 100 percent there. near the end, things got very bad. i got
    only about four hours of broken sleep a night caring for him, and no one in the
    family would help me. during part of his daily care routine, he had a second accident
    all over the freshly cleaned floor. i lost it and hit him. he''s gone now, and
    i can barely live with myself. when i think about it, i get nauseated and dry-heave.
    i literally hate myself. in my book, exhaustion doesn''t give anyone the right

    my son "pete" is a felon from an incident that cost him six years in a federal
    penitentiary. he has one more year left on parole. he married a professional "psychic"
    he met online who we believe has borderline personality disorder. there have been
    several instances of serious physical abuse toward my son. he is constantly trying
    to adapt to her ever-changing moods to reduce these conflicts, to no avail. yesterday
    she smashed a coffee pot into pete''s face, causing a 3-inch gash. then she took
    his guitar and smashed in the windows of his truck. when she''s not violent, she
    threatens to kill herself. she recently moved here from the u.k. and must maintain
    a living situation with her husband for at least a year to establish citizenship.
    pete wants to stick it out for the sake of his wife''s daughter. i think my son
    should call the police and make a report, but he is afraid of how she would and
    will retaliate. she knows his background and could accuse him of anything, if
    it comes down to a "he said/she said" situation. i''m not sure what to do, abby.

    i have a very close cousin (and friend) who is in a toxic relationship with a

    i have been married for eight years, and my husband is a wonderful spouse when
    it comes to almost everything. my complaint may seem shallow, but please hear
    me out. a couple of years back, he started buying me potted plants rather than
    cut flowers because "you get more for your money." he buys me plants three or
    four times a year, and after receiving the third one i asked him to please go
    back to cut flowers. i neither like house plants nor do i want something i must
    find a place for in our yard. despite this, he continues to buy me potted plants
    every time. each time he says he "forgot" i don''t want them. i don''t want to
    seem ungrateful, but i am really frustrated. today i received my 10th one. i suppose
    i seem like a jerk, but i really don''t understand why he keeps buying me the
    one thing i asked him not to buy. your thoughts? -- kathy in washington'

    i was at my brother-in-law''s house with my husband and our 4-year-old daughter.
    we were playing our weekly video game, and when my brother-in-law won a round,
    he shouted a racial epithet. i asked him not to use it in front of my little girl
    because if she repeats it at school, she could be suspended, and we don''t use
    that kind of language in our family. now he claims i "disrespected him" and i
    should apologize to him because it was his house and he can say what he wants.

    is a candle lighting and spoken remembrance of those loved ones we have lost.

    i was best friends with "joanne" after we met in middle school. she comes from
    a conservative christian family and has three successful siblings. this has made
    her quirky, media-driven pursuits and city life a disappointment to her family.
    when we were teens and she learned that i was a straight ally for gay rights,
    she came out to me as a lesbian, but for years only i and a few close friends
    knew. once she was an adult and her family found out, they practically disowned
    her and made their disapproval and "shame" very clear. unfortunately, due to some
    family problems of my own, i moved away, and we communicated only periodically
    for the last couple of years until recently. i was shocked when she informed me
    that she is going to become a nun. abby, i have no problem with her faith (i attend
    an lgbt-friendly church), but i''m afraid joanne is doing it for all the wrong
    reasons. for the 15 years i have known her, she has been an open-minded, culture-loving
    social butterfly, and she doesn''t seem to have changed much personality-wise.
    naturally, her family is thrilled with her decision because it means she will
    never date another woman or be a part of "that lifestyle." i know joanne is an
    adult and these choices are hers to make, but i''m afraid she is being guilted
    into a life she will ultimately regret. how do i express my concerns to her without
    being offensive? -- kathy in new york'

    as chairman of the american institute of cpas'' tax executive committee, may i
    offer some clarification to you and your readers about your answer in your july
    13 column titled, "couple deep in tax hole need help in climbing out"? in fact,
    three groups of tax preparers have unlimited practice rights under department
    of the treasury regulations to represent their clients on any matters before the
    irs -- certified public accountants, attorneys and enrolled agents. none are more
    qualified than cpas. cpas are licensed by state regulators and must meet minimum
    education requirements to sit for their national licensing exam and then fulfill
    ongoing continuing education requirements, as well as abide by a code of professional
    ethics. attorneys have a generally similar system. enrolled agents are often former
    irs employees who are licensed by the irs after passing an exam. enrolled agents
    are competent and respected tax professionals, but the fact they are licensed
    by the irs does not mean they are better qualified or superior in serving clients
    than are cpas or attorneys. irs.gov has a page explaining the different types
    of tax return preparers and their qualifications, which may be helpful to your
    readers. -- troy k. lewis, cpa'

    before claiming it as his own. i immediately posted a free "found dog" ad online

    a 72-year-old woman who lives alone. she discovered her back door open one day
    and her dog missing. i put my co-worker in touch with the lady and said i''d leave
    it to him to do what he felt was best. after confirming the dog was indeed hers,

    until recently. "angie" is a sweetheart with a good sense of humor. when i''m

    recently, my husband was asked to be the best man at his friend''s wedding. the
    happy couple did not have the financial means to hire a photographer, so i was
    asked to take pictures of the ceremony and reception. i''m not a professional
    photographer, and the bride knows that. i gladly photographed the nuptials on
    the couple''s big day. of course, i charged them nothing for doing it. i am now
    on the receiving end of insulting comments regarding the photos i took. when the
    bride rudely voiced her displeasure, i was taken aback. i did nothing less than
    my very best to accommodate her, and i have received nothing but ingratitude and
    disrespect for my efforts. i believe in keeping commitments i have made. i intend
    to complete the edits of the original photos and create a wedding album as i promised.
    however, how do i tactfully address the situation with the bride if she "reminds"
    me again of my lack of professional photography skills? -- sad newbie photographer'

    we had a falling out. she was going through a tough time and lashed out at me.
    when i tried to have a conversation with her to tell her i didn''t like how she
    was treating me, she told me to "have a nice life." shortly after that, my youngest
    sister struck up a friendship with her and insisted that my parents invite her

    our family dinner, but mother said it would be rude to not invite her. i no longer
    join my family for holiday dinners. is it wrong of me to not want my family to
    be so friendly with someone who was unkind to me? it seems odd to me that my former

    i am 21 and on my second marriage. my husband of two years is every girl''s dream
    man -- the kindest, gentlest, most patient guy. he loves me for everything, including
    my flaws. i honestly believe he is the only one who could ever handle me. so tell
    me, why am i cheating on him? i never thought i could find myself in this situation.
    i have a lot happening in my life, but there is no excuse for why i am straying
    from such an amazing husband. i love him, but when i get a text, i hope so badly
    that it''s from the other man, and when it''s from my husband i feel disappointment.

    don''t know what to do. i can''t tell my husband -- it would ruin his life. i''d
    rather just leave him without giving any reason than tell him the truth. i want

    a younger woman, and they are starting a family through in vitro fertilization.

    plans to conceive, i was devastated. after a few months, mom and i were able to
    reconnect and talk about it. i''m happy they''re happy, but i''m still uncomfortable
    with the situation. when the children are born, i am unsure how i will be known.

    he will no longer be the youngest. but at my age, as a business owner and in a
    serious relationship, i prefer to consider brian my sibling, not the twins. i
    will love the babies because they are connected to me, but i''m leaning toward

    grandson are unrealistic. since his birth three weeks ago, i have seen him only
    once -- at the hospital. she has taken him on two outings: one where there were
    10 people and another where there were more than 100. (my grandson has not yet
    received any of his childhood vaccinations.) my daughter now says that when i
    visit, i must change into freshly washed clothes before entering her house. she''s
    afraid that the secondhand smoke will harm him. i''m not unintelligent. i have
    bought disinfectants to spray on myself, as well as breath strips. i also wash
    my hands, arms and face before i hold him. am i unrealistic in thinking she''s
    asking too much, or should i say something to her and let her know how much she
    has hurt me? -- crying day and night'

    throughout my three grandchildren''s lives, i have picked them up from school,
    and attended school functions, games and activities in which they have participated.
    their parents work, and i was helping out. i have given them money for camps,
    clothes for all changes of season, and anything they especially needed or wanted.
    i baby-sat after school and on weekends while my daughter-in-law, "kathy," went
    to "memory book classes" and special scrapbooking lessons. i''m always at her
    beck and call. i do anything i am asked, even if i must rearrange my own schedule.
    the oldest grandchild graduated this year, and kathy had photos out and memory
    books displayed for everyone to see. as i glanced through, i noticed there were
    no pictures of me with the kids nor any from our side of the family. my son (their
    father) was barely in any of them, either. there were plenty of photos with kathy,
    her mom and her siblings. although kathy has a nice camera and has snapped pictures
    of us, none made it into the memory books. i am truly hurt. when the children
    look back in years to come, it will be as if we were never in their lives. they
    will see only one side of their family tree. they have other cousins, aunts and
    uncles they will not remember. am i wrong to feel hurt that we were left out of

    i am the 24/7 caregiver for my husband, "earl." we were both widowed when we married
    nine years ago. his daughter, "mindy," hasn''t talked to her father for six years
    -- hasn''t called, emailed or even sent a birthday card. if he tried calling her,
    she wouldn''t pick up. recently, earl had a serious health problem resulting in
    a colostomy bag. i take care of everything. when he called to tell mindy, her
    husband answered the phone and said she wasn''t home. when my husband told him
    about his health, the son-in-law said ok -- nothing more. then earl invited the
    whole family to come here. again, the response was, "i don''t know." after earl
    hung up, i said, "i think it''s time mindy came here to take care of you." (six
    years ago she told my husband, "dad, if you die first, i''ll get that woman out
    of the house in three days!") abby, must i wait for this to happen or should i
    just pack my stuff and move out, leaving a vulnerable 88-year-old man alone? mindy
    will put him in a nursing home and sell the house to pay off her credit card debt
    -- some of it, because the house isn''t worth much money. earl says, "don''t leave
    me, i need you!" well, what about me? where is my life and my security? i''m getting

    i''m frustrated about how to connect with my young adult son''s 18-year-old girlfriend.
    he told me she has a bad relationship with her divorced parents, so he''s hoping
    we can bond. a problem that comes up frequently is, she''s so anxious to show
    me how skilled and knowledgeable she is, she misses any tips and techniques i
    try to subtly teach her. they live together in another state, so our weekend visits
    at each other''s homes seem to amplify the problem. i''ll give you an example:
    when i removed ice cubes from an ice tray, i ran water over the bottom briefly
    before twisting the tray. she laughed like i was clueless and said, "you don''t
    have to do that, just twist the tray!" i replied that the water helped release
    the cubes more cleanly "because of the physics of the warmer water." she teared
    up, left the room and told my son (who repeated it to me) that i was being critical
    of her. i have expressed appreciation for her, and my son has reassured her of
    my intentions, but i''m getting tired of tiptoeing around her issues. how can
    i help her understand that she can learn from me without it meaning that i think
    any less of her? -- on eggshells in montana'

    had approached her at the gym and said he was single, so they went on a date.
    after our wedding he stopped seeing her, but continued contacting her. she figured
    something was up, and found pictures of me and my husband on facebook. when she
    told him she knew he was married, he stopped calling and texting. she said she
    knew him for only a week and didn''t have sex with him. when i confronted him,

    like "concerned''s" husband, i, too, am labeled as high risk for stds based on

    what does that mean? were they married then? if not, is he labeled high risk due

    i have been dating my boyfriend, "derek," for four years. after a night of emotion-filled
    discussion, he asked me to marry him. i said yes, but it has always been a difficult
    idea for me to wrap my head around. i''m turning 21 and although that may be old
    enough for some people to get married and have kids, it scares the heck out of
    me. i love derek and i want to marry him one day. he assured me we could stay
    "engaged" for a few years, but it still makes me uneasy. we don''t have a ring
    yet, and we agreed we wouldn''t tell our families until we get one. it doesn''t
    feel real because there''s no ring and no one knows -- could that be why i''m
    so nervous? i need a second opinion and some advice on whether to wait to tell
    anyone or tell people now. -- cold feet'

    i''m a single mother of two wonderful daughters. i have a fantastic boyfriend,
    "roy," who i met when i was pregnant with my second. we have been together for
    six months and i love him very much. unfortunately, he has become mildly controlling
    and critical. roy has no children of his own, and he doesn''t seem to realize
    what goes into working, raising children and running a household. recently, he
    gave me a promise ring, which i accepted. he''s great with the girls and he makes
    me happy. my father, however, says that the controlling behavior will only get
    worse down the road. i think it''s because roy was laid off from work and is having
    a hard time finding a job. i''m sure once he''s working he''ll be less focused

    i recently phoned one of my mother''s best friends, "edna," to wish her a happy
    birthday. it was her 101st. when i asked her about her family, she spent some
    time sobbing over the recent news that her eldest son has cancer. my first thought
    -- and that of several others -- was, why was she told?! edna is frail and in
    poor health. she has seen her share of tragedies and losses in her long life,
    and i think she should have been spared this devastating news. hearing her sob
    on her birthday broke my heart. however, a couple of my friends disagreed with

    hit a rough patch in that journey and divorced, but we didn''t stop going to church.
    it''s crazy, i know. after we divorced, i knew i messed up and deep down i knew
    i loved him. so, now that we have remarried, it seems like he''s taking the role
    of christian husband back to biblical times. this means he is the head of the
    house (which i get), but to the point where i am almost like a fixture. i would
    say i''m here for my looks, but i am overweight. i would say it''s for the sex,
    but it isn''t happening morning, noon and night, if you know what i mean. i would
    say it is the money, but now, after his last raise, he makes more than i do. he
    cooks most of the time because he gets home before me. the house is always clean,
    and we share the household bills and expenses. so, i''m kinda lost and confused.
    do i have a purpose here? or am i only here to help pay the bills? -- starting

    may i comment on the letter from "open-minded in pennsylvania" (3/6), the adoptive
    mother of a biracial child who asked for a witty comeback for strangers'' comments/questions?
    this is a rare teaching moment! if a parent reacts with the slightest hint of
    displeasure, the child will think the parent is displeased with her/him. we adopted
    a daughter of a different race 29 years ago. when i received comments/questions
    from acquaintances and strangers, my face would light up, and i''d respond, "oh,
    we adopted her! she is filipino! we are so blessed to have her in our lives!"
    usually, the person would smile and say something positive. the rare times someone
    didn''t, we would hurry on with a wave and a smile, and i would hug her close.
    our daughter has grown up proud of her ethnic background and knowing she''s special.
    she is now married and the proud mother of two biracial children. -- judy in texas'

    me to come and look at something on his computer. i responded, "sir?" his cousin
    immediately started poking fun at it, and the rest of his family joined in. to
    me, "sir" is a gesture of respect to my husband. his family seemed to interpret
    it to mean i think i''m less than an equal in our relationship. this is definitely
    not the case. alex and i both make sure to show respect and appreciation to each

    i am 22. i met my boyfriend, "jordan," in college. we live together with a roommate.
    throughout our relationship, there have been times when jordan was inconsiderate

    be out "late." then he ends up staying out all night without letting me know he''s
    not coming home. he has done this quite a few times. his excuse is that i am supposed
    to call to hound him, and ask where he is and when he''s coming home. he''s often
    not respectful of my time and comes home hours after he says he will. most of
    the time he''s out with friends i know, but i am losing trust and feel less important.

    when i ask him please not to tell people about it, he says, "why not? you have

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    my in-laws are fabulous. they love me and think the world of our 2-year-old daughter,
    "hayley." they do anything to support us. recently, they asked to take hayley
    overnight and drive a number of places with her. my concern is the driving part.
    my father-in-law doesn''t believe in car seats. on a few occasions he has asked
    me to just hop in the car with hayley without a car seat. i refused. another time,
    they had a circa-1980 car seat and asked to take hayley with them to church. when
    i went to put her in the seat, the buckles wouldn''t work. when i reached over
    to the other side, the seat fell over. it wasn''t even strapped in! now for my
    biggest fear: my mother-in-law is a notorious distracted driver -- she applies
    makeup, eats food, talks on the phone and texts. i am not comfortable with her
    taking hayley in the car with her. how do i approach this with them? i don''t
    want to harm our relationship, and i''d like them to spend time with their grandchild
    independently. but i can''t put my daughter in a dangerous situation. any thoughts
    would be appreciated. -- fearful mom in san antonio'

    my husband is very affectionate. he loves to cuddle, snuggle and sweet-talk morning,

    don''t get me wrong -- he''s a good husband, and i get a quick hug and kiss goodbye
    when i leave for work in the mornings and he holds my hand when we walk. but when
    we go to bed at night, he turns his back to me, reaches behind him, pats me on

    i''m a high school student, but it''s not easy for me. studying is hard at home
    because i just want to goof off after a long day at school. my grades are ok,
    but i''m worried that if this continues they will slip. then there''s my eating
    habits and fitness. my school lunch period starts late in the day, so it''s hard
    to stay satisfied from breakfast. when i get home, i''m still hungry and eat whatever''s
    around, not usually healthy. and sitting all day at school doesn''t help my fitness.
    recently, i decided to have only a cup of water or soda until dinner, but i''m
    not sure that''s healthy. exercising at home doesn''t happen because i''m either
    goofing off or doing homework. finally, there''s my sleep habits. i go to bed
    at 8 or 9, but i have to wake up at 5 the next morning. how can i have good grades,

    i represented my daughter "stacy" and her husband as their real estate agent.
    when any of my children purchase a home, i waive my commission. my daughter knew
    i had been trying to finance a trip to south america for my husband so he could
    complete his "bucket list." she gave me a cruise on one of the most expensive
    cruise lines and airfare to south america as a gift for helping with their home
    purchase. after my husband reviewed the itinerary, he said it wasn''t the trip
    he had in mind and wanted to know if my daughter could change it. i was embarrassed
    to ask her after receiving such a gracious gift. he became indignant and said
    if she really wanted to give him something he wanted, she wouldn''t mind changing
    the trip. i told stacy i couldn''t accept her gift because it was too much money.
    my husband is now angry with me because he feels i am the person at fault for
    the loss of the trip. is my husband right that we should request a gift exchange
    from the giver, or was i justified for not accepting it in light of the fact that
    it was too much money? -- just wants peace'

    during wwii, while i was overseas in the navy, i received a "dear john" letter.
    it was devastating, especially because i was so far away and unable to immediately
    respond. do you think it is appropriate for a person to send such a letter while
    the person is far away, especially while in the service, or should the person
    wait until the service member returns home and say it''s over face-to-face? after
    all these years, i have heard many pros and cons about this question. i can think
    of no one else with such a wealth of knowledge in this area to ask but you. after

    i recently found out my grandmother has been diagnosed with lung cancer and has
    elected not to treat it. the doctors give her a year at the most. my dilemma is
    whether to extend just one more olive branch. she has never been a "warm and fuzzy"
    type of grandmother. she was cold and distant when i was in my teens and 20s,
    and downright mean when i was in my 30s. if i try to talk to her at family functions,
    she turns away and begins a conversation with someone else, not even acknowledging
    that i''m standing there. last year at a family reunion, she took several photos
    with my mom and sister, and when it was suggested i join them in the photo, she
    walked away before one could be snapped. i''m not the only family member or grandchild
    she behaves this way toward. none of us knows why. do i try one more time, suspecting
    the diagnosis hasn''t softened her heart and that i''ll again end up with hurt
    feelings? or do i assume that nothing i do now will change who she is and that
    i will have no positive, happy memories of her? -- invisible in kansas'

    ever since i was young, which was not that long ago, i have known my parents''
    marriage wasn''t a healthy one. but only recently has it begun to affect me emotionally.
    it isn''t that i blame myself, but that i''m afraid of how my own romantic endeavors
    will fare. recently, i was told about my mother''s infidelity. i was always curious
    and suspected that one or both of them had affairs. but now more than before,
    i worry about finding love. love is something we all seek, and i believe we all
    need, but i don''t see myself as able to handle that kind of heartbreak. i understand
    why mom did it -- that''s part of what hurts me. i''m angry that they would masquerade
    a failure "for me," that failure being their "relationship." i think my anger
    is valid. my family has screwed me up emotionally and it started long before i

    swimsuit. i looked up and a woman i didn''t know was about to take a photo of
    two other women. i was in the background. fortunately, i was able to leap out
    of the way, and the only part of me that might have been photographed was my backside.
