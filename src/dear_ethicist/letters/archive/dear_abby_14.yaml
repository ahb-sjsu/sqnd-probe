    i have just read the article from mr. and mrs. ellington mills, of hot springs,
    ark.,regarding the background music on tv programs that causes the dialogue to
    be drowned out. i''m also perturbed by this same annoyance, but have found a solution.
    may i suggest that they run, not walk, to their tv store and purchase a new television
    set? i was not aware that approximately three years ago, manufacturers were required
    to put closed captioning on tv sets to assist the hearing impaired. not only does
    this help the hearing impaired, but it also helps the viewer who does not have
    a hearing problem keep up with the dialogue. it''s fabulous! it also helps when
    the phone rings and the tv must be put on mute, because the closed captioning
    is still on screen. while i''m on my soapbox, may i please praise the producers
    of tv programs and advertisers who use closed captioning. i have made a point
    to purchase items that are advertised that way. my wish is that the older films
    have closed captioning added. it would be appreciated by the millions who use
    the service. -- wanda a. foster, fort smith, ark.'

    every year after graduation, thousands of young adults begin new jobs and move
    into homes of their own. although this is an exciting time for them, it also can
    be a difficult one as they struggle to furnish their new living quarters. most
    are reduced to begging from relatives, "making do" with castoffs, or doing without.
    since people marry later now, bridal showers often are given for older persons
    who have good jobs and who already have acquired everything they need. some couples
    even purchase and furnish homes and live together for months or years before they
    say "i do." young, never-employed brides who migrate straight from parents to
    husbands (the ones for whom bridal showers were designed) are rare today. isn''t
    it time to add a new twist to the old tradition and give "starter" showers for
    single men and women who are setting up housekeeping for the first time? "starting
    over" showers would benefit people who have lost everything in disasters, as well
    as people who have recently divorced. what do you think, abby? -- marilyn swartz,

    two years after my divorce, i met "jake," a divorced man near my age (50-plus).
    after several dates, he suggested that we sleep together. he promised not to sleep
    with any other woman, but wants to continue dating because he doesn''t want to
    be accountable to anyone. jake told me that one of his former girlfriends ("melanie")
    has been a bright spot in his life, and he plans to continue seeing her. he takes
    her dancing, to the movies, to parties -- and he travels with her. two weeks ago,
    jake invited me to accompany him to a party at melanie''s home. i accepted and
    went, but now i wish i hadn''t. he stayed by melanie''s side most of the evening.
    they were holding hands and looking into one another''s eyes, oblivious to all
    who were present. i was very uncomfortable, but i didn''t want to make a scene.
    later, jake told me that he loved melanie, but was not "in love" with her -- whatever
    that means. it doesn''t seem to matter that i was upset knowing that he is seeing
    melanie and other women, too. in fact, he said that when he told her i was jealous,

    i was offended by your response to "nameless, of course," who was upset that her
    former brother-in-law''s new wife had "corrected" her when she introduced them
    as "my brother-in-law and his wife, joann," by injecting, "he was your brother-in-law."
    you were way off base to label the new wife as a "petty, insecure woman." i think
    that label better applies to the former sister-in-law. as the wife of a former
    widower, i know you were correct when you stated that marriage is more than the
    joining of two individuals; it is also the joining of families. but abby, if joining
    families is a goal, why would you condone this obvious exclusion of the current
    wife? if "wayne" is her "brother-in-law" and "joann" is "his wife," apparently
    he is still considered a part of the family, but she (the newcomer) is not! she
    felt she was treated as an intruder, hence her strong public corrections. no one
    likes to be on the outside looking in, particularly when her spouse is on the
    inside while she stands out in the cold. i have watched some of my husband''s
    former in-laws struggle with this. those who seem to have the greatest difficulty
    are the ones who have not accepted the death of my husband''s first wife. my husband
    reacts to this by seeing as little as possible of his former in-laws, who continue
    to live in the past and cannot accept his new life -- or me. my mother-in-law
    handles these situations in the classiest, warmest way i''ve ever seen. at 79
    years young, she has dealt with a lot of "comings and goings." in her eyes, everyone
    is an in-law. her brother died at age 39, and his widow is now on her third husband.
    mom always introduces them as "my sister-in-law and brother-in-law," and we refer
    to them as "aunt and uncle." now that''s a beautiful welcome into the family.
    ours is a large extended family with many in-laws, and our family events are truly
    special because everyone feels included. "nameless" should take the hint, back
    off, and accept joann as the newest member of the family. that way, she would
    gain a sister-in-law, and her "former" brother-in-law would have the family support
    he and his new wife need in order to succeed in their new life together. -- am

  subject: Issue of Assisted Suicide Raises Concerns Among the Disabled
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    this is in response to your column regarding physician aid-in-dying. legalized
    assisted suicide is seen by many as death with dignity -- an end to suffering
    for terminally ill people who have rationally thought through their options and
    have made a very personal choice. history supports the fact that society does
    not value equally the lives of people with disabilities and those without. during
    the formative years of the effort to legalize assisted suicide, members of the
    disabled community voiced philosophical concerns about the dangers to people with
    disabilities. dr. kevorkian has clearly demonstrated he isn''t concerned with
    whether or not the conditions of his "patients" are terminal. he was recently
    acquitted of aiding the suicide of a 30-year-old man who had recently become a
    quadriplegic. did anyone make a concerted effort to counsel the man for depression,
    to look closely at the reasons he thought his life wasn''t worth living? maybe
    he needed peer counseling to address the fears most people have about being disabled,
    fears about not having adequate support, resources and opportunities necessary
    to achieve a quality life. the disabled community has legitimate concerns. while
    recent court decisions have upheld assisted suicide only for competent, terminally
    ill adults, judge stephen reinhardt, when he wrote for the majority in the decision
    of the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, also said that death is more humane
    than continuing to live in "a childlike state of helplessness." needing assistance
    using the toilet, eating and bathing do not connote helplessness, nor preclude
    having a quality life unless you don''t have access to the help you need. needing
    help is a far cry from being terminally ill. when an able-bodied person attempts
    suicide, his or her choice is considered irrational. when a disabled person attempts
    suicide, the act is more readily judged "sane." after all, if you''re not physically
    functional, how could life be worth living? the dangers of assisted suicide to
    the disabled community are enormous as long as doctors, judges and juries continue
    to cast doubt on the worth of people with disabilities. -- mary ann jones, acting
    executive director, westside center for independent living inc.'

    after a recent family gathering, several of us decided to visit the grave of a
    recently departed loved one. as we gathered our coats, a 3-year-old in the group
    asked where we were going. she was told, "to visit aunt lola." "where?" she asked.
    the answer was, "heaven." when we arrived at the cemetery, a relative pointed
    to the grave and told the child, "this is heaven, and this is where aunt lola
    lives." the child became noticeably upset and could not understand why her favorite
    aunt was living underground. then she was told to blow kisses to the grave and

    knew what the other relatives had told her daughter about having gone to "heaven"
    to visit aunt lola. the mother said that was what she wanted her daughter told,
    and she was telling her the same thing! abby, i have taken several child psychology
    classes and have read a great deal on the topic. i''ve always been under the impression
    that children should never be told that a deceased person has "gone to heaven"
    because the child will then believe that heaven is a place they can visit, and
    that the deceased person may be coming back. when i explained this to my relatives,
    they said i was being ridiculous because she was only 3 and would not remember
    any of this. abby, i think she will remember. these relatives are well-educated,
    not ignorant. what is your opinion? -- ridiculed relative in richmond, va.'

    illness of three years duration. we were completely faithful and devoted to each
    other throughout our marriage. i have been asked out by several men whom i refused
    because i thought it was too soon after my husband''s death. (also, i had no interest
    in these men.) i now find myself attracted to a widower who belongs to a group
    i belong to. if he asks me out, what is the respectable amount of time to wait
    before i accept a date? (i am feeling guilty just thinking about it.) i would

    i''m a recovering alcoholic who loves to entertain. the letter from the woman
    in tucson who abstains from coffee, tea and alcohol for religious reasons struck
    a chord with me. like her, i''m comfortable dining out with people who order drinks,
    but shopping for liquor or keeping it around the house would present too great
    a temptation. i''ve found a couple of solutions. one is to invite people for brunch
    instead of dinner. when offered an assortment of herb teas or fruit juices, no
    one clamors for a bloody mary. another is to let guests bring whatever they want
    to drink. here in the midwest, no one accepts a dinner invitation without asking,
    "what can i bring?" i reply, "if you''d like wine or beer, bring it along." then
    i make sure they take home the leftovers. in the winter, i''ve found that hot
    cider or hot chocolate is always welcomed; freshly squeezed lemonade draws raves
    in the summer. if friends can''t enjoy a few hours with you without drinking,
    they need to take a long, hard look at their own alcohol use. i know -- i''ve
    been there! i didn''t think i could have a social life in sobriety, but i was
    wrong. now i enjoy the parties i give much more, and i don''t have to face the

    i am a semiprofessional photographer. i charge for some of my work, but most of
    it is done for fun. recently i attended the wedding reception of some close friends,
    and i shot four rolls of film (about 100 photos) at the event. i had the film
    processed and printed, and i printed labels for the backs of the pictures giving
    the date and names of those in the photos. i put them in a wedding album and gave
    it to the bride and groom as a wedding gift. a friend of theirs invited me to
    her wedding reception. it was unspoken, but understood, that i would take pictures
    there. i paid for four rolls of film. however, since the bride works for a photo
    lab, i thought she could get the film processed and printed free (or at a discount),
    so i simply gave her the rolls of film. she had assumed that i would pay for processing
    the film, and now she''s upset with me. i think she was expecting too much for
    nothing and should have been happy to pay for her own developing costs. am i wrong?

    the drop of a hat. 2. i''ll work with you to create the best possible relationship,
    including a great sex life. 3. i''ll take the kids away once in a while so you

    i am 23 years old and my boyfriend is 26. we are currently living in different
    states due to my job commitment and are maintaining our relationship via long-distance.
    the other night "clyde" called and, in the course of our conversation, mentioned
    that his ex-girlfriend had been in town and that she had called him. she asked
    him out to a movie, he accepted; they went out that evening. end of story. he
    said he was telling me about this innocent date because he didn''t want there
    to be any secrets between us. i believe that was truly his motivation for telling
    me, but i still think he should have let the incident go unmentioned. he is being
    painfully honest, and the pain is all mine. if i had a platonic date with a male
    friend, i would not mention it to clyde because i think he would worry unnecessarily.
    am i off base here or is there a limit to how much unsolicited info should be
    shared? -- t.l.c. in los angeles'

    if you give a birthday gift to a friend, isn''t it proper for the friend to remember
    you with a gift on your birthday? i thought that was how it worked. i always try
    to give my friends gifts for their birthdays. however, my birthday was a week
    ago and not one of the six good friends to whom i gave gifts gave me one. one
    gave me a card, another made cupcakes to share with everyone at lunch, and another
    friend decorated my locker. (i''m a high school student.) the other three did
    nothing. perhaps this is just my opinion, but i don''t consider a card a gift.
    to me a gift is something material that someone has put some effort into making
    or buying -- not something that was put together at the last minute. the cupcakes
    and decorated locker were very nice and i appreciated them, but after having given
    them real gifts for their birthdays, i was disappointed not to receive any. i''m
    sure it wasn''t a matter of money for any of them. i don''t intend to say anything
    to them about it, but when their birthdays come around again, should i still give
    them gifts, or should i just wish them happy birthday with a card? i love to give
    gifts, but i find it offensive when people don''t treat me the same way i treat
    them. -- disappointed birthday girl'

    i''m a 20-year-old independent young woman with problems up to my eyeballs. i
    am eight months pregnant with a child i do not want and cannot provide for. i

    believe that the baby is his, and i have made arrangements for adoption. i''m
    not emotionally or financially able to take care of a child. i can barely make

    i am very troubled. when i married my second husband, "fred," he told me he was
    a virgin, and passed himself off as caring toward women. then, after our marriage,
    he mentioned that he used to frequent strip joints. i was upset about it because
    i''m a feminist, and i feel that visiting strip joints is disrespectful to women.
    two days before i went into labor to deliver our son, fred told me that out of
    the five women he had slept with, he ranked me about third. after all, i''m 10
    years older than fred, and i''ll never be as physically attractive as a prostitute.
    then he said that emotionally he was more attracted to his high school sweetheart.
    abby, this is my second marriage and my third child. my chances of finding romance
    again are getting slimmer and slimmer. i''m not ugly; i''m tall, slender and fairly
    attractive. i can''t understand why someone who claims to love me would tell me
    that i rank lower than a prostitute. i was crushed. it made me feel very undesirable.
    i told fred if he wanted a younger woman, i''d leave and take the baby so he could
    start over again. he said no, he wanted me. i find it degrading to live with a
    man who has been with prostitutes. he could have given me a disease. am i the
    only woman who finds men who frequent prostitutes revolting? i can''t see myself
    spending the rest of my life with a man like fred. however, he''s going to college

    our family was invited to my brother-in-law''s wedding. the invitation said "adults
    only" and noted that a baby sitter would be provided at the house. nice try, but
    no go. look at it from my side: i''m to drive to a strange state, a strange city,
    a strange house, leave my 2-year-old with a stranger, and then off for six hours
    and have fun? fat chance! i''d worry and so would my child. furthermore, a kid
    is not a pork chop or a dog; you can''t freeze it or tie it up in the back yard.
    our options were: i stay with my child and my wife attends the wedding and reception
    alone, or we disobey the rules and bring our kid, or we don''t go. period. however
    we do it, the hosts are not going to be pleased, but that''s life. we attended
    the wedding as a family. i brought books and toys, parked in a corner of the reception
    hall, took my kid to wrestle on the lawn and explore the country club. then i
    read to him. afterward, i apologized to the hosts, who were very gracious. but
    what disturbs me is how brides lose track of what their wedding is all about.
    because they''re spending $25,000, they plan a major hollywood production or a
    disneyland extravaganza. they want to direct and make everything perfect. it''s
    not going to happen. a wedding is nothing but a fancy party, a celebration bringing
    families and friends together. uncle albert is just as likely to get drunk and
    paw the women, or cousin bruce to start a fight, or jeannie to flirt with the
    groom as my kid is to spill his punch. you might as well note on the invitation:
    "no drunks, punks, flirts or smokers." if a bride wants a flawless affair, she
    should hire a producer, choreographer, and actors to stand in as family, and then
    mail videos to "invited guests." five years from now, when these brides have their
    own toddlers, they''ll receive an invitation to a wedding with a p.s.: "no kids
    allowed." then they will understand that every hurt comes home. -- a family man

    i recently took a vacation trip to hawaii with a friend. the vacation itself was
    fine, except for the airplane flight. upon taking our seats, we noticed a young
    woman with long hair seated directly in front of us. she immediately started running
    her fingers through her hair and flipping it over the seat. then she leaned her
    chair back and continued to toss her hair over the back of the seat. in fact,
    she didn''t even lean forward for the meal. she was not asleep or reading. this
    went on for the entire five-hour flight! we asked her to please lean forward so
    we could get by to go to the bathroom. when she moved, she made a snide remark
    and gave us a look that could kill. the seat was immediately returned to the completely
    leaned-back position -- hair hanging down and all. hey, you''re trapped on a plane,

    because of our religious beliefs, my husband and i do not drink coffee, tea or

    i respectfully disagree with howard childress, whose letter appeared in a recent

    merely reflections of society and do not really influence the viewers. if he were
    right, advertising agencies across the nation would be out of business. through
    those ad agencies, u.s. advertisers are spending billions (that''s with a "b")
    per year to influence viewers to buy their products and services. they know how
    much television influences viewers; they have tested it many times! abby, imagine
    a dialogue between a concerned viewer and a tv executive. it might go something
    like this: concerned viewer: mr. television executive, your shows have too much
    sex, violence and bad language in them. they''re a bad influence on our young
    viewers. tv executive: our shows just reflect society; we don''t really influence
    viewers. they will do what they want, no matter what we put no tv. viewer: fine,
    mr. executive. i want to buy a minute of advertising on one of your prime-time
    shows. how much will that cost? executive: we can let you have a minute of prime-time
    advertising for just $100,000. viewer: what? $100,000! why so much? executive:
    because we reach so many households and so many potential buyers of your products
    and services. we know we have great influence with our advertising; we''ve tested
    it. viewer: wait a minute. are you telling me that sex, violence and bad language
    don''t influence your viewers, but your advertising influences your viewers so
    much that you are going to charge me $100,000 per minute for it? executive: yes.

    regarding the letter from howard childress, who said the media only reflect the
    trends of society rather than set them: you, sans qualification, replied that
    there was truth in his observation. we have ample evidence that the media do,
    in fact, affect how people behave. would mr. childress suggest that commercials
    are merely a reflection of people''s buying habits? aren''t they actually deciding
    our buying habits? mr. childress used stories from the bible as substantiating
    evidence. let''s look at the evidence that is better documented and more reliable.
    children are murdering children. short of the original sin, children are innocent
    until taught to do bad things. they don''t instinctively throw baby brothers out
    of 15-story buildings. they learn to devalue life from watching lives bring snuffed
    out. where do they see people taking lives? tv and movies. i wouldn''t say from
    books because most people don''t read many books. i remember studying a case in
    psychology class where a small village, similar to the one mr. childress described,
    was without tv. cables were run into the village. sociologists, realizing the
    opportunity to study tv''s effect, surveyed the villagers. two years after the
    installation, they resurveyed, finding that aggression and the propensity for
    violence had increased disturbingly. while i agree, the media do reflect social
    mores, they undoubtedly influence those mores greatly. we must hold producers
    and advertisers responsible for this influence; otherwise, we will likely become
    prisoners in our own homes. -- jeff paul, minneapolis'

    our 29-year-old son married a beautiful girl about six years ago. we noticed before

    anything, but we tried to set an example by voicing appreciation when they --
    or anyone else -- did something nice for us.) now, however, our son seems to have
    acquired the same behavior, and it''s very disturbing because he was raised to
    be courteous and appreciative. when either one receives a gift, they look at it,
    may say something like, "oh, where did you get this?" or more often than not,
    say nothing, and they just put it aside. abby, we don''t give strange or odd gifts.

    my husband and i have been married 23 years. he''s 44 and i''m 43. we have a mortgage,
    several bills, no happiness, no kids. we have one dog whom he treats and talks
    to like a child, which embarrasses me. our marriage is a sham. we do what''s necessary
    to make it look good when we''re out, but we''re both miserable. we have nothing
    in common. we tolerate each other. needless to say, i no longer love him. he''s
    had several affairs. i confronted him about some of them; however, i said nothing
    to him about others. i left him once. he promised if i would come back, he would
    never have another affair, and he bought me a car and took me on a cruise. the
    next time i caught him, i left and threatened to get a divorce if he didn''t buy
    me a house. we were living with his parents, whom i dislike, and all my friends
    owned homes. he bought a house, and i came back. big mistake. our sex life is
    awful. when he can perform, i can''t stand him touching me. the only way i can
    get through it is to fantasize about other men. i have also had affairs. he knows,
    and i don''t care. we take separate vacations every year, and i go away as often
    as i can. i almost always have a fling while i''m away. my husband is arrogant,
    egotistical and not very well liked. the wall that separates us is getting higher.
    i want out of this sham of a marriage, but he won''t consider divorce. to him,
    it''s a "failing" -- he uses the excuse that people never get on their feet after
    divorce. i suspect he''d rather go on acting than face the fact that he''s not
    confident that he can make it alone. we could split everything down the middle,
    and he can even have the damn dog. abby, i just can''t picture us growing old
    together. i don''t want to grow old with him. twenty-three years is enough --
    too much. i don''t want a scene. what should i do? -- wants out in westminster,

    parachute infantry during the battle of the bulge? we were fighting in difficult
    terrain and weather when the christmas mail arrived. short of transportation to
    get it to the 14 companies, we sent the following message: "we have mail and rations,
    but can send only one of them today. which shall it be?" every unit replied, "send
    the mail!" -- howard p. melvin, regt. sgt. major, wwii readers: to send mail to

    i''m 39, and have been divorced for two years after a 14-year childless marriage
    of misery. i live alone in a tiny trailer two doors up from my father''s house.
    i own and manage a 200-acre farm, which is all that''s left after a tedious five-year
    divorce settlement. my finances are horrendous, but i''ve managed without borrowing
    from my dad or any other family member. my mother died when i was 14; i did all
    of the housework and helped with the younger siblings. i followed in my father''s
    footsteps and majored in agriculture in college. we have always gotten along and
    i''ve always enjoyed spending time with dad. so why does my father continue to
    allow my ex-husband to live rent-free in his house ever since our separation and
    all through the long divorce? abby, i''m within shouting distance and eating roadkill
    to stay financially viable. my ex went overseas for a while, but predictably,
    he lost his job and now he''s right back at dad''s place -- even though he has
    family in another part of the state. i just can''t understand my father''s behavior.

    today i''m reading about how you differentiate between the terms "having sex"
    and "making love." you must get tired of people picking apart what you write,
    but i think i have a good point in suggesting an alternative. i agree that "having
    sex" is demeaning and not above what the other animals do out of instinct; but
    why do we have to create affection as the term "making love" suggests? shouldn''t
    the love already be there and the sexual interaction be the ultimate expression
    of that love? perhaps the term "sharing love" better expresses what we hope that
    individuals of all ages are experiencing, ideally, in the marriage relationship.
    thanks for your consideration of this suggestion. i don''t read your column every

    you printed a letter from judie songer of rogersville, mo., about junk mail. her
    letter prompts me to write. ms. songer stated that "americans receive almost 2
    million tons of junk mail daily!" this information apparently was obtained through
    ms. songer''s research for a class speech. abby, 2 million tons equal 4 billion
    pounds. if we assume the population of the united states to be 250 million, that
    equates to 16 pounds of junk mail for each man, woman and child in the country.

    the volume of junk mail is annoying and represents unreasonable waste. this letter
    is not a criticism of ms. songer, but when one refers to information sources,
    too frequently our discernment is in the "off" position. does this really matter?
    yes, i think so. as americans, we are called upon daily to make decisions that
    affect every aspect of our lives. for example: please note that this is a presidential

    even drugs. yesterday, three kids were suspended because of their use of drugs.
    earlier this year, someone brought a pocketknife on my bus. i''m only in seventh
    grade, and i still have my whole high school to go through. one of my best friends
    even told me she wanted to get high just to see what it is like. (she also threatened
    one of my other friends she doesn''t like -- not because of me, though.) i feel
    so defenseless. what can i do to protect myself? please publish this in your column
    so others in my situation will know what to do. thank you so much. -- scared in

    regarding "hurting and hoping, fort worth, texas," whose son mysteriously disappeared
    five years ago, leaving his family to wonder if he was dead or alive: i had the
    same experience. my son was staying at my sister''s home when he went out one
    evening and never returned. at first we assumed it was a temporary disappearance,
    but as time went on, we realized it was for real. for five years, i heard not
    one word, and i visualized everything from prison to death. the anxiety of not
    knowing is indescribable. finally around the fifth year, i gave up and said to
    my lord, "i am turning it over to you"; then i put it out of my mind. in september
    of the fifth year, i received a letter, and the thrill of recognizing his handwriting
    on an envelope made my heart want to jump right out of my chest! his letter said
    that he was coming home and would be at the airport at a certain time on a specific
    day. of course i was there to meet him, and i have never questioned him as to
    where he had been or the reason for his silence. i felt that since the lord had
    answered my prayers, who was i to question him? he is now a respectable young
    man, holding a good job and sending me letters of appreciation constantly. so
    to "hurt and hoping," don''t give up. keep praying. -- faithful from fresno'

    i am a full-time mother of two precious children -- a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old
    -- and i absolutely love my job. although there is no material compensation, the
    rewards are very sweet. however, it has become clear to me that there is not much
    respect for those of us who choose to stay home and put our careers on hold. i
    can''t tell you how many times i''ve been asked, "so when are you going back to
    work?" these people do not seem to understand that i work 24 hours a day, seven
    days a week. it''s not all fun and games; there''s a lot of hard work involved
    in raising two children. this job is not meant for everyone, but i resent the
    lack of respect i am shown. i respect those who choose to work outside the home
    and feel that i deserve the same. perhaps those who think this job is easy and
    trivial should try it for a few weeks. spending a few days in my house would definitely
    change their outlook. i have decided that we full-time mothers need a new title.
    i started telling people that i am an "investment broker" -- i specialize in futures.
    it has raised more than a few eyebrows and i no longer hear the rude comments.

    i read your column and find it entertaining and often educational. but i think

    her brain, the other lady mentioned something about her brother. figuring it might
    give her a clue to the lady''s identity, the woman asked, "your dear brother --
    what is he doing these days?" "he''s still president of the united states," she
    replied. (she was calvin coolidge''s sister.) well, abby, that''s a cute story,

    in high school. his father and i have been divorced since lewis was 2 years old,
    and he has lived with his father, who is principal of a large high school, for
    several years. lewis is intelligent, but in spite of that, he struggles to maintain
    grades high enough to keep himself eligible to play sports. i could accept that,
    since his father was a late bloomer, but i have trouble with his lying. lewis
    constantly cons his dad, me, his teachers and his friends. since i live 2 1/2
    hours away from my son, i cannot be a daily influence. we talk frequently on the
    phone; however, we don''t see each other often. i used to enjoy our telephone

    breaking my heart. of course, lewis denies telling lies. i want to help him, but
    i don''t know how. abby, this seems to be a family trait. his father, his grandmother
    and his aunt are liars, but they won''t admit it -- they just keep on lying. what

    i seldom miss your column in our local newspaper. our family often discusses and

    so many of your readers. it was only after the death of my granddaughter that
    i saw the letter you printed from the 25-year-old woman thanking you for saving
    her life by printing the warning signs of an abusive partner. after seeing your
    column and recognizing that her boyfriend fit every warning you mentioned, she
    left him and started a new life. how i wish our beautiful 19-year-old granddaughter
    had seen that list. she had been living with a young man for four months. although
    her family didn''t approve of him and had tried to dissuade her from living with
    him, they made an effort to accept him and welcome him into the family so they
    wouldn''t lose their daughter. after a particularly nasty quarrel, my granddaughter
    separated from the young man and returned to her family. a week after she left
    him, he brutally murdered her. although she had been close to her parents (and
    all the family), she had never once confided to anyone the abusive relationship
    she was in. her parents are devastated. their lives have changed forever. our
    family would like to be able to help other young women in these circumstances,

    i am now joining the ranks of those who have read your column for years, but have
    never written until now. as a 65-year-old woman, i was appalled with the piece
    you printed on the glories of youth. according to you, everything that is positive
    is equated with being young: vigor, self-confidence, hope, courage and beauty.
    but everything negative is equated with being old, such as fear, pessimism, cynicism
    and hopelessness. abby, have you any idea how ageist this is? it makes being old
    abhorrent and depressing. when i proudly tell people that i am 65, they say, "oh,
    you don''t look that old," as though they were paying me a compliment. in reality,
    it is an insult. what is a 65-year-old woman supposed to look like? i am no longer
    young and have no desire to pass as "young." at my age, i am more creative, have
    more self-confidence, hope and spirituality than at any other time in my life.
    abby, we have learned a lot about racism and sexism; let us now open our minds
    to ageism. we need to proclaim "old" as something positive. in closing, let me
    share a quote i saw on a button where there were many senior citizens. "youth

    this is the first time i''ve ever written to you, but i have been reading "dear
    abby" since i was a teen-ager and i trust your advice. i was married to "harold"
    for 15 years. we had three children together and divorced four years ago for several
    reasons. the main reason was that he was unfaithful to me. i was hurt, bitter
    and angry because i had always been faithful to him. i never dreamed i would end
    up divorced, having to raise three children alone. now, after four years, he has
    had a relationship fall apart, and so have i. we have both reached the same conclusion.
    it is very hard to find a partner who is completely accepting of someone else''s
    children. it makes life extremely complicated to be with someone who does not
    accept the full "package." we are presently considering the possibility of dating
    and possibly reuniting our family. it makes a lot of sense for many reasons. abby,

    my husband and i appreciated your column on what not to say to an infertile couple.
    we are a professional couple in our late 30s, and infertility has been a part
    of our lives for almost 10 years now. we''ve been to six fertility specialists
    and have endured many months of high-tech procedures. we have decided now to detour
    from the medical route because of the cost and spent emotions. it''s more devastating
    not to be pregnant after spending several hundreds of dollars. our current doctor
    cannot detect a medical problem with either one of us. we have tried to adopt
    a few times, but it didn''t work out. the most difficult part of infertility is
    the deafening silence. most of our friends and relatives have had children with
    no difficulty; consequently, they can''t relate to infertility. we no longer attend
    family reunions because it''s too stressful. relatives seem concerned only with
    how many children one has, and since we have none, we have nothing to talk about.
    we have endured many insensitive comments over the years from intelligent, well-educated
    people. abby, i''d like to add a few more things to your list of "the 10 worst
    things to say to an infertile couple": 1. "are you barren? or is your husband
    shooting blanks?" 2. "when god closes a door, he opens a window." 3. "your husband
    should try wearing boxer shorts." 4. "try standing on your head for several minutes
    after lovemaking. they say gravity is the key to conceiving." sign me ... inconceivable

    my brother recently passed away, leaving his widow financially comfortable. she
    didn''t have many friends, so i tried to spend as much time with her as possible.
    we planned a trip together, and in order to get to the airport for an early morning
    departure, i invited her to spend the night at my house. i gave her my bedroom
    and slept on the couch in another room so she could have her privacy. after the
    trip was over, i discovered that she had broken my favorite crystal figurine,
    without mentioning it to me. also, an overnight bag was missing from my closet.
    in the past, she has been known to remove photos from our family albums. also,
    she was once fired from her job for stealing, but we all believed that she had
    been unjustly accused. (now we have our doubts.) i fear that confronting her will
    cause a rift in our families, as i am quite certain that her children and grandchildren

    i have read your column for many years and enjoy it. the services you offer to
    the military, such as operation dear abby, are great. however, i''m writing you
    now because of a disturbing letter i read in your column from kent d. myrick of
    phoenix, regarding peace corps benefits. i sympathize with mr. myrick and all
    peace corps volunteers regarding their lack of recognition for a valuable contribution
    to all peoples. my problem is with his characterization of military members as
    "my peers who are trained to go to other nations and subjugate or kill their inhabitants."
    i''m a sergeant first class in the u.s. army and have served my country proudly
    for 18 years. i had thought that this kind of prejudice against the military was
    dead. i would like mr. myrick to take a moment of his time to research some of
    the missions that our country''s military forces have been involved in during
    recent years -- operations such as those that have taken place in somalia, rwanda,
    and those currently taking place in the former yugoslavia. all were operations
    designed to help countries get back on their feet and, in many cases, to allow
    the inhabitants to enjoy the freedom that we as americans enjoy. this is 1996,
    and some of the utmost concerns of today''s military are peacekeeping and peace
    enforcement missions. we are currently deployed around the globe providing support
    to people in need through many different programs. do we love the people of other
    lands? see the tears streaming down the face of a 21-year-old specialist as he
    holds a child in ethiopia who has just died of malnutrition. you will find his
    tears are not for himself, but they are the pain of knowing that this tragedy
    never should have happened. it''s unfair to judge the military and peace corps
    workers as peers. it is through the hard work and diligence of our country''s
    armed forces that we are able to have an organization such as the peace corps.
    i assure you that while members of the military are trained to fight in the defense
    of our country, we have many other valuable skills as well. thank you for allowing

    think about it -- if you eliminate junk mail, how many people will be out of work?

    lumberjacks and factory workers to produce products sold by mail, and copywriters,
    photographers, truckers, computer operators, and on and on. entire businesses

    i would appreciate your advice on a problem that has been a nightmare for me.
    my husband is in prison. he will be serving time for the next 10 to 15 years for
    a crime he did not commit. my biggest problem has been how to deal with our two
    children, who are 6 and 8. they have been very close to their father, and for
    the past year, they have sort of "accepted" his absence because i told them he''s
    away on a business trip and will be home soon. they talk to him on the phone once
    a week. i am now considering going back to my country with the kids where i''ll
    be closer to my family and friends. should i tell my kids that their dad can''t
    come with us because he can''t leave his business? or should i tell them the truth?
    i fear they will be unable to handle the truth at their ages. they think prison
    is a place for "bad" people, and i''m afraid it will kill them to find out that''s
    where their dad is. also, what will they say to their classmates if others ask
    them, "where is your father?" my instinct is to hold off until my kids are old
    enough to handle the situation. but if i wait, will they resent me for not telling
    them sooner? if i lie to our kids, i couldn''t bring them with me to visit their
    father. i love my husband very much and have to deal with this pain, too. but

    i am 44 and have been divorced for two years. i recently met a very attractive

    is money -- it would break him. i went to bed with him on our first date, and
    it was wonderful for both of us. after that we saw each other almost every night
    for two months. then he said we were getting "too close," and suggested that we
    end our relationship and just be "friends." i explained that i was in love with
    him and couldn''t be his "friend." i know he has feelings for me, but he''s too
    stubborn to admit it. i have not been with any other men since i met him. i''ve
    called him a few times, and can tell by his voice that he still cares for me.

    my husband and i had our first child, a boy, last fall. we were both very happy
    because the baby is healthy and we had wanted a family since our marriage four
    years ago. we enjoyed shopping for baby clothes and furniture. my husband, "chris,"
    was gentle and supportive throughout my pregnancy, and was at my side during labor
    and delivery. by choice, i took four months off work and only returned part time
    until the baby is older. shortly after the baby was born, i noticed that chris
    was moody and constantly on edge, but i let it pass. when it became medically
    possible to resume our sex life, he did not seem eager. (we have always had an
    active love life.) chris refuses to feed or diaper our child, but often complains
    that the baby "smells bad." he finds fault with my housekeeping and cooking. he
    sits in front of the television barely speaking, or "goes out with the boys" after
    work, which is very out of character. he calls me "tubby" and says i should get
    in shape, which has almost brought me to tears. abby, i gained only 13 pounds
    during the pregnancy, most of which i left at the hospital. i am 5 feet 6 inches
    and weigh 118 pounds, less than i weighed at our wedding. when i confronted chris,
    he said he is sorry, but he no longer finds me appealing or attractive because
    i am now a mother! i am hurt and shocked beyond words. i do not know what to do.
    i do not want my son to grow up with divorced parents, and despite all this, i
    still love chris. yet he has become a complete stranger. i cannot reach him. what
    can i do to save my marriage? (please, no state or town.) -- diana x'

    on the subject of giving baby showers for unwed mothers: a few years ago, the
    women''s organization board of my church decided to give a baby shower for the
    young woman who baby-sat in the nursery during sunday services. (i''ll call her
    "tracy.") she was unmarried, pregnant and teetering very close to going on welfare,
    with little support from her family or the father-to-be. putting aside the morality
    of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, we and all the young mothers of the children tracy
    watched on sunday reached out to another human being in need. i believe this is
    what good christians are supposed to do in such a situation. tracy had a baby
    boy, and not a tongue clucked nor was an eyebrow raised when tracy and her infant
    son played mary and baby jesus in our live nativity scene in our christmas pageant.
    i believe it''s possible to reach out to someone in need -- in this instance,
    an unwed mother -- without condoning the situation, don''t you? -- martha fox,

    presence. she puts me down constantly, criticizing how late i serve my children
    dinner (i walk in the door at 5:30 and we eat no later than 6:30), how they "seem
    to get sick more often than most kids," and how her friends'' children take their
    mothers shopping, to plays, to view christmas lights, etc. abby, i''ve had it!

    a large home, working full time, serving as chauffeur to my sons, and trying to
    nurture a successful marriage. our relationship is about as dysfunctional and

    i''m an avid reader and respect your opinion, which prompts me to write this letter.
    i am 31, and for three years i have been dating "tom," who is 11 years older than

    recently we''ve been discussing marriage. tom has two daughters from a previous
    marriage. "angie," the 21-year-old, does not live with him. "michelle" is 18,

    michelle''s functions together, and i praise her when she excels in something,
    but after three years, she has not warmed up to me. i don''t mind her cool treatment,
    because she is always respectful and courteous. if tom and i marry, i would prefer
    that michelle not address me by my first name. what is the appropriate way for
    children to address their stepparent? (by the way, angie is very fond of me and
    we get along great.) tom and i have agreed to abide by whatever you suggest. --

    an iou has no legal value whatsoever! think about it. all it states is that one
    party owes another party money, and it does not involve any promise to pay it
    back by a certain date, etc. there is nothing sadder than having a couple of old,
    retired people come into my office with a handwritten iou on a piece of paper.
    the last couple had given their son $30,000 and wanted me to collect it for them.
    abby, first, parents should not lend their children money unless they can afford
    to lose it. second, they should at least have a promissory note secured by a mortgage,
    etc. and you should stress that this can be wiped out by bankruptcy! please correct

    i lived with my stepmother from the time i was 11 until i was an adult, and believe

    charles dropped out of school, stays out all night, has girlfriends spend the
    night, and his bedroom is so filthy the door must remain closed because of the
    smell. he works full time, and i feel that if he''s not going to school, then
    he should pay rent and do his share around the house. that was the rule when i
    was growing up, and it worked. part of my problem is that i can''t get his father

    regarding "enraged in bremerton, wash.," who has been inspired to political activism
    by the closing of a government-sponsored food shelter in her state: why does she
    assume that it''s the government''s responsibility to feed the hungry? where in
    the constitution does it say that? rather, it is our duty as neighbors and citizens
    to help those less fortunate than ourselves. she wanted to know what she could
    do to influence the government about the injustice of the closure. while voting
    responsibly and educating herself on the issues is always a good idea, rolling
    up her sleeves and pitching in to solve the problem herself is an even better
    idea. how about getting on the telephone to private businesses and local community
    members and asking for their financial support to keep it open? she could also
    make calls to area grocery stores, wholesalers, restaurants, etc., and ask them
    to regularly donate their surpluses and good-but-unsellable food to the food bank.
    she could ask local media to announce a food drive to help fill the shelves as
    well, and ask for volunteers to run it. many food banks across the country are
    run in precisely this manner -- all organized and staffed by volunteers. when
    we volunteer our own time, it brings us closer to the problem, and we become more
    invested in solving it, rather than sloughing off responsibility to the government.
    best of all, it''s done with donated time and food that would have gone to waste,
    rather than spending our precious tax dollars. -- eileen coale, annapolis, md.'

    i never thought i''d be writing to you, but a family problem has gotten out of
    hand and i need the help of an objective party. my older brother, "victor," who
    is 28, attempted suicide two years ago after a messy breakup with his wife, with
    whom he was still in love. he now regrets the act and realizes that they married
    too young (at 21). since suicide is a crime in our religion, my parents and my
    younger sister, "sarah" (who is still in college), refuse to speak to victor.
    in a few months, i plan to marry a wonderful man. we had planned to include both
    victor and sarah in the wedding party. however, each has said he/she will not
    attend if the other does. my parents predict that my marriage will end as victor''s
    did if i allow him to come. victor says our parents will disown me, too, sooner
    or later, so it may as well be sooner. my husband-to-be just rolls his eyes. whom

    my wife and i arrived around 5 o''clock. we thought we''d see many of our old

    to find only 10 other guests. they served hot cider and non-alcoholic punch --

    couldn''t remember the name of someone she ran into on the street one day. as
    she racked her brain, the other lady finally mentioned something about her brother.
    "oh, yes ... your dear brother ... what is he doing these days?" she asked, figuring
    this might give her a clue to the lady''s identity. "oh, he''s still the president

    the letter from jose fidelino interested me. my wife was born in laos. her mother
    came from china and her father from vietnam. she also lived in thailand for several
    years, so she speaks many languages. since we now live in long beach, calif.,
    we''re 20 minutes from chinatown, 20 minutes from little saigon and five minutes
    from little india. we have two children, and when we are all together, we get
    lots of stares. when my wife takes the children without me, she is asked lots
    of questions from strangers wanting to know where she got them (as if she had
    stolen them), but she takes it as a compliment and moves on. as for people asking,
    "where are you from?" i hear that often, but i do not take it as an insult. in
    the case of asians, they are asking, "may i talk to you?" it is simply a sign
    that they are interested in you and are groping for a starting point. i have started
    many conversations with, "where are you from?" and i found out that the best cakes

    i actually had the chutzpah to write my own ten commandments. but it wasn''t as
    though i was stealing from strangers -- i steal only from the best! one of my
    ancestors was privileged to have received them on mount sinai from the lord himself.
    at least that''s what the good book says. i originally wrote two sets of commandments:
    one for men and one for women. then i received a letter from mandy stillman, a
    lawyer and early feminist from milwaukee, demanding equal rights for women and
    insisting that there be only one set of commandments. she was right, of course.
    so how''s this for a gender bender? the ten commandments of love -- put your spouse
    before your mother, your father, your son and your daughter. your mate is your
    lifelong companion. -- do not abuse your body with excessive food, tobacco, drink,
    or any foreign substance that goes into your arm or up your nose. -- remember
    that cleanliness is a virtue. -- permit neither your business nor your hobby to
    make you a stranger to your children. the most precious gift a parent can give
    is time. -- willingly share all of your worldly goods with your mate. -- do not
    forget to say, "i love you." even though your love may be constant, your spouse
    needs to hear those cherished words often. -- remember that the approval of your
    spouse is worth far more than the adoring glances of a hundred strangers, so be
    true and forsake all others. -- keep your home in good repair, because out of
    it come the joys of old age (not to mention its resale value). -- forgive with
    grace, because who among us does not need to be forgiven? -- honor the lord your
    god every day of your life, and your children will grow up and bless you. today,
    be a sweetheart. call someone you love and say, "i love you." (make two or three
    calls; who says you can''t love more than one person -- in different ways, of
    course.) go through your closets and give all those clothes you''ve been saving
    until you lose 10 pounds to your favorite charity. call someone who''s lonely
    and say, "i''m thinking of you." or, better yet, say, "i''ll be over tomorrow
    to take you to lunch ... or to run some errands for you ... or to give you a ride."
    visit a sick friend. say a prayer. donate some blood. adopt a pet. will your eyes,
    your kidneys and all your usable organs to someone who can use them after you''re
    gone. forgive an enemy. hug your teen-ager. write a fan letter. listen to a bore.
    pay your doctor. tell your parents you think they''re wonderful. spay your dog.
    neuter your cat. quit smoking. drive carefully. if you''re walking, watch where
    you''re going. and don''t wait until next year to be a sweetheart again. -- love,

    i''ve read your column for years and you are usually "right on," but in a recent
    column you goofed royally. a teen-aged girl was invited to a baby shower by the
    mother of one of her young friends. the girl''s grandmother advised her not to

    your advice, and you advised her to go to the shower because the baby needed gifts

    to consider here than whether or not the baby needed things. a baby shower is
    a party celebrating the future arrival of a baby. in attending such a party, the
    guests are honoring the mother and celebrating the coming event. in my opinion,
    an unwed teen-aged mother hasn''t anything to celebrate. how does one earn the
    privilege to be a parent? 1. complete your education. 2. work for several years
    to save some money. 3. get married at a reasonable time -- not in your teens.
    4. wait at least a year before getting pregnant to be sure the marriage will last.
    our society has supported unwed mothers for two or three decades. now look at
    the epidemic we have. i don''t suggest shunning these girls, but my attitude is:
    "this is a problem you created; now you and your family will have to handle it."
    as a schoolteacher, i see babies born to girls who are neither emotionally nor
    financially able to handle motherhood. through the years, when i''ve been invited
    to baby showers for unwed mothers, i politely decline. i''ve never felt guilt
    and the people about whom i really care have respected me for declining. if one
    of my grandchildren ever became an unwed parent, i would never put my friends
    on the spot by inviting them to a baby shower. and if their friends gave one,
    i would send a gift but would not attend. -- michigan mom'

    my son (i''ll call him ned) just turned 40. recently a 19-year-old boy came forward
    and announced that he was ned''s son. when ned told me, i invited the young man
    to my home for dinner so we could meet. ned seems eager to accept this boy as
    his son, even though the boy''s mother has had three other sons by three different
    men. the boy looks nothing like anyone in our family (not that this is necessary),
    but i''d like to have some tests done before i change my will to include a grandchild
    that may or may not be mine. where do we go, and what do we need as proof of blood

    i should want proof before leaving an inheritance to a person who has never made
    contact (nor has his mother) before now? -- strictly confidential'

    recently i left a pot of rice on the stove too long. by the time i remembered
    it, the pot was smoking. last week, a friend of mine accidentally started a grease
    fire in her kitchen. i heard many tragic news reports over the holidays about
    christmas trees causing fires and heartbreak in what should have been a joyful
    season. abby, i''d like to pass on a suggestion that was made to me after my close
    call with the rice: every home should have at least one fire extinguisher. the
    new ones are inexpensive and come with easy-to-follow instructions. learn how
    to use it as soon as you get it home, then put it in plain sight. if you buy only
    one, the kitchen is the best place to keep it. i have decided to purchase fire
    extinguishers as gifts for the weddings, housewarmings and graduations i know
    i''ll be invited to this year. what better way to say, "i care about you"? thanks,

    this concerns all those letters in response to "hurt mother-in-law," whose daughter-in-law

    "mom." she didn''t ask me to, so i came right out and asked my in-laws if i could
    call them "mom" and "dad." they said it was ok with them, but every time i did,
    they looked uncomfortable, so i quit calling them mom and dad and started calling
    them by their first names. well, i could see they weren''t pleased with that either,
    so i just gave up and avoided calling them anything. they are very undemonstrative
    and never hug or kiss each other in public. they kiss above their grandchildren''s
    heads when they greet them. this is foreign to me because i grew up in a very
    affectionate family. however, my husband didn''t, although he shows me lots of

    my mother is 59. my father was 74 when he died last year. they had been married
    for 40 years. when they met, my mother was 19, and father was a 34-year-old widower
    with a 4-year-old son i''ll call max. when dad died, mom went to a grief counselor
    who told her to "go for it." nine months later, mom moved max into her bedroom!
    max is my half-brother, but technically he is not a blood relative to my mother.
    i thought it showed terrible judgment on her part when she had him move in with
    her, and most of my relatives agreed. after all, max had been my mother''s stepson

    about one-quarter of my guest list was made up of single, unattached adults who

    recently you recommended toastmasters international for adults who are shy and
    afraid to speak in public. have you never heard of international training in communication?
    we were founded as a women-only club 51 years ago under the name of international
    toastmistresses clubs. at that time, toastmasters was for men only. both clubs
    were later forced to become co-ed. when that happened, the women flocked to join
    the men, although both clubs offered the same benefits. sensing that men would
    not care to be called "mistresses," in 1985, we changed our name to international
    training in communication, retaining the initials itc. i have been a member of
    itc for more than 25 years. it has worked wonders for me because i can now stand
    up and speak when necessary without shaking knees. we learn far more than speechmaking.
    we gain overall self-improvement skills. the benefits are too numerous to recite.
    to locate an itc club in your area, call the chamber of commerce. our clubs are
    located in every free country in the world! please mention us, along with toastmasters.

    i am a retired executive of a nationally known insurance company. i was with it
    for 31 years. i''m now 62. my wife died two years ago, and after her death i sold
    my house, returned to my hometown, bought a condo, joined aarp and settled in
    to being a "golden-ager." every morning i have breakfast at my favorite restaurant
    and read the newspaper while i eat. i''m very anti-smoking, and the restaurant
    has a section for nonsmokers. a few months ago, a nice-looking woman began coming
    into the restaurant about the same time (mid-morning) as i did. she''d sit in
    the smoking section, have a couple of cigarettes, several cups of coffee and read
    the newspaper. she appears to be about my age, well-dressed and very attractive.
    i have never spoken to her. i don''t even know her name. one morning we were the
    only two customers in the place, and a waitress, while pouring my refill, said,
    "why don''t you go over there and speak to that lady and get acquainted? she lost
    her husband last year, and she''s a very nice person." i replied, "thank you,

    i''m one of the many people who are highly allergic to perfumes. we seem to be
    an expanding circle, because i know nine other people with the same affliction.
    i avoid crowds, do my shopping in the early morning hours, and try to sit away
    from others at funerals and weddings. one exposure leaves my nose congested and
    my lungs filled with fluid. i cough for days. why do people insist on drenching
    themselves in perfume? i was taught that restraint is important: a tiny drop on
    the wrist or neck is sufficient. no one is supposed to bathe in the stuff. i recently
    attended a funeral, sitting well to the back and off to the side with my nonscented
    friends. halfway through the service, the door opened and a wave of perfume wafted
    across the church. i was ill the remainder of the day. some advertisers place
    perfume samples in magazines, scenting the entire mail system. if this were my
    kingdom, perfume offenders would be relegated to isolated sections in public,
    and perfume bottles would require a warning label: "this product may be hazardous
    to the health of others." those who use perfume should have an honest friend check

    the letter from "good neighbor, ventura, calif.," prompts this letter. who elected
    her to be the neighborhood cop? my wife and i own a condo in florida. the majority
    of the owners use their condos only for short vacations and rent them out the
    rest of the year. the complex is beautiful, but the busybodies there drive us
    nuts. these full-timers, who occupy only 10 percent of the units, think the complex
    is their private domain. the year-rounders are overly concerned about tenants
    who have unapproved sunshades on their balcony or who fail to get permission to
    fly the american flag from their sunporches on the fourth of july. they complain
    to security about children playing on the lawns (which are not off- limits) and
    don''t understand that people in the swimming pool like to laugh, splash and have
    a good time. these crabs and cranks have driven away repeat renters. they dominate
    homeowner board meetings and almost always get their way. all the owners in our
    complex are supposed to be equal, but it seems that some are more equal than others.
    "good neighbor''s" mother was right. she is a busybody, and you should have told
    her to mind her own business. people like her make us wish we had invested somewhere

    the long island woman who was devastated because her jewish daughter indicated
    she may become catholic should take comfort that catholics are free to do whatever
    jesus did. jesus of nazareth was a jew who regularly went to synagogue and often
    led the services. he strictly observed the commandments and celebrated all the
    jewish holidays. any catholic may go to temple, join the hanukkah festivities,
    host or attend a seder, etc. in so doing, the catholic is not "being jewish."
    catholics have not traditionally celebrated the jewish holidays because for centuries
    jews and catholics saw one another as adversaries. today jews and catholics realize
    that they share the heritage of the hebrew scriptures and that they can best resist
    the rapid disappearance of all religion from public life by working in harmony.
    it is catholic to celebrate the miracle of the temple lamp, and much more so to
    celebrate the time when jews were saved by the body and blood of a lamb, a foreshadow
    of the lamb whose body and blood redeemed us all. when this woman''s granddaughter
    asks her mother, "why are we going to grandma''s for passover if we''re not jewish?"
    the answer should be: "god calls us to honor our father and our mother; they celebrate
    passover and we honor them by being with them on important occasions. also, because
    we are celebrating the passover as jesus did each year of his incarnate life.
    finally, because jesus instituted the sacrament of holy communion at his last
    passover seder." -- marty barrack, burke, va.'

    this letter is in response to the jewish mother who was devastated by the prospect
    of her daughter''s conversion to christianity, and therefore her granddaughter''s
    religious upbringing. i''m a christian and would love to be able to say i''m jewish
    -- but i can''t. jewish history is christian history. that''s what the old testament
    is. i feel a kinship with jews because we worship the same god and study the same
    people: david, isaiah, moses, noah, daniel, etc. this is my heritage as well.
    i would love to celebrate the jewish holidays because i believe they are important.
    we should remember that god spared the firstborn of israel when the angel of death
    passed over the homes whose doors were marked with the blood of the lamb. this
    young granddaughter will be blessed to have the opportunity to learn her full

    there seems to be a common misconception that because a mother, father or child
    is a "step," the significance of that relationship is diluted. let me assure you
    that neither blood ties nor time determines the depth and strength of a relationship.
    the case of susan smith comes to mind. those were her flesh-and-blood children
    whose seat belts she strapped before pushing that car into the lake! one of the
    coldest, albeit most innocent, shocks i got was when a co-worker asked me after
    i returned from the funeral of my second father, "was he your real father or just
    your stepfather?" just? that made him sound positively throwaway! my mother received
    a staggering outpouring of love and caring. she lost a husband, and i lost a father
    -- not a stepfather. i hope this letter will cause people to think with their
    hearts and not their dictionaries. i am signing my name, but if you use this,
    i respectfully request anonymity. thank you. -- grieving daughter'

  body: 'dear readers: my new year''s column has become an annual tradition. these
    new year''s resolutions are based on the original credo of al-anon. i am using
    its theme with some variations of my own: just for today, i will live through
    this day only, and not set far-reaching goals to try to overcome all my problems
    at once. i know i can do something for 24 hours that would overwhelm me if i thought
    i had to keep it up for a lifetime. just for today, i will be happy. abraham lincoln
    said, "most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be." he was
    right. i will not dwell on thoughts that depress me. i will chase them out of
    my mind and replace them with happy thoughts. just for today, i will adjust myself
    to what is. i will face reality. i will correct those things that i can correct
    and accept those that i cannot. just for today, i will improve my mind. i will
    not be a mental loafer. i will force myself to read something that requires effort,
    thought and concentration. just for today, i will do something positive to improve
    my health. if i''m a smoker, i''ll make an honest effort to quit. if i''m overweight,
    i''ll eat nothing i know to be fattening. and i will force myself to exercise
    -- even if it''s only walking around the block or using the stairs instead of
    the elevator. just for today, i''ll do something i''ve been putting off for a
    long time. i''ll finally write that letter, make that phone call, clean that closet
    or straighten out those dresser drawers. just for today, before i speak i will
    ask myself, "is it true? is it kind?" and, if the answer to either of those questions
    is negative, i won''t say it. just for today, i will make a conscious effort to
    be agreeable. i will look as good as i can, dress becomingly, talk softly, act
    courteously, and not interrupt when someone else is talking. just for today, i''ll
    not try to improve anybody except myself. we know so much more about nutrition
    and how exercise and sensible living can extend life and make it more enjoyable,
    so just for today, i''ll take good care of my body so i can celebrate many more
    happy new years. just for today, i will have a program. i may not follow it exactly,
    but i will have it, thereby saving myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.
    just for today, i will gather the courage to do what is right and take the responsibility
    for my own actions. to one and all: a happy, healthy new year! -- love, abby p.s.

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have been retired from teaching for many years, and would like to share a lesson
    i learned that stands out in my memory like no other: i was young and teaching
    math at the junior high school level. we had worked hard on a new concept all
    week, and the students were very stressed. they were frowning, frustrated and
    carping at each other and me. wanting to stop the crankiness before it got out
    of hand, i asked the students to take out two sheets of paper, and list the names
    of the other students in the room, leaving a space between each name. then i told
    them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates,
    and write it down. it took the remainder of the class period to finish the assignment.
    when the students handed me the papers and left, they seemed more relaxed. that
    weekend, i wrote the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper and listed
    what the students had said about that individual. on monday, i gave each student
    his or her list. before long, everyone was smiling. "really?" i heard one whisper.
    "i never knew that meant anything to anyone." "i didn''t know anyone liked me
    that much!" the assignment was never mentioned again, but it didn''t matter, because
    the exercise had accomplished its purpose. the students felt better about themselves
    and each other. years later, i was asked to attend the funeral of one of those
    students, a promising young man even when i taught him in junior high school.
    i was deeply saddened by his untimely death in vietnam. the church was packed
    with "mark''s" friends, many of whom had been his classmates and students of mine.
    after the funeral, i and many of mark''s former classmates were invited to his
    parents'' house. they approached me and said, "we want to show you something.
    mark was carrying this when he was killed." his father pulled something from a
    wallet. it was the list of all the good things mark''s classmates had said about
    him. "thank you so much for doing that," mark''s mother said. "as you can see,
    mark treasured it." a group of mark''s classmates overheard the exchange. one
    smiled sheepishly and said, "i still have my list. it''s in my top desk drawer
    at home." another said, "i have mine, too. it''s in my diary." "i put mine in
    our wedding album," said a third. "i bet we all saved them," said a fourth. "i
    carry mine with me at all times. i think we all saved our lists!" that''s when
    i finally sat down and cried. the lesson my former students taught me that day
    became a standard in every class i taught for the rest of my teaching career.

    while i love my parents very much and thank god for them daily, having aging parents
    was hard on me emotionally. i remember praying to god when i was only 4 years

    advice to the couple considering having children: if you are in good health and
    are well prepared to be around for the next 40 to 50 years, by all means have
    children. just keep in mind that they''ll be counting on you to be around, so
    take care of your health. another suggestion: if you''re hesitant about having
    children, why not share your love and life by adopting older children who need

    but trust me, the age difference will show up before long. have you ever taken
    care of an infant long enough to discover how exhausting infant care can be? will
    you have the stamina to stay up all night with a sick child and still go to work
    in the morning? when you''re in your 60s and your child is a teen-ager, will you
    snap back after being up all night wondering where that child is? or worse, because
    you do know -- thanks to a cop who called to say your kid has been arrested? don''t

    i am a single father with primary custody of my 11-year-old daughter, "nadine."
    she and i are very close. she lives with her mother on weekends. however, since
    her mother works out of state, on some weekends she doesn''t make it home to be
    with nadine. abby, i have a rule that my daughter cannot have her girlfriends
    spend the night at our home. it''s because i''m afraid of being accused of misconduct
    with her friends. i would never behave inappropriately, but today, men must be
    careful that there is no possibility of suspicion. i would not feel comfortable
    with nadine spending the night at the home of a friend who lived alone with her
    father, and i think most parents probably would feel the same way. am i cheating
    my daughter by not allowing her friends to sleep over? am i wrong to protect myself
    from the possibility of accusations? or am i being paranoid? -- ''overly cautious''

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    until two years ago, i thought i had a marriage as good as it gets after the honeymoon.
    we had some problems, but a marriage without some problems doesn''t exist. the
    real problems began when my wife''s son (i''ll call him paul) came to dinner --
    and stayed. he is 40. i am 75, and getting older by the minute. this "boy" was
    coming off a failed relationship and needed a place to crash. his mother invited
    him to stay with us without consulting me. that was her first mistake. i didn''t
    object. that was my first mistake. abby, i am not heartless. i figured paul would
    stay maybe a month or two. a year went by while he "looked for work." (he rarely
    left the house.) our home is small, with only one bathroom. the two bedrooms are
    only 10 feet apart. you can bet i was annoyed, but i thought the arrangement was
    temporary. i naively believed he would leave when he found a job. paul has had
    a job that pays well for more than a year now, but he can''t seem to find a house
    or apartment he likes better than our home. my wife has said nothing to him to
    indicate she is unhappy with this state of affairs, but i told him he has to get
    on with his life, and let us get on with ours. he agrees, but doesn''t move. short
    of forcibly ejecting paul, i''m at a loss what to do except leave. i have roots
    here and a ton of emotional and material baggage, and hate the idea of pulling
    up stakes at this time in my life. but the possibility becomes more probable every
    day. needless to say, my wife and i are not on good terms now, and "frankly, i
    don''t give a damn, scarlett." abby, what''s a guy to do about a stepson who has

    to visit her. ordinarily she is so sweet and lovable that i consider her a sister,

    for days to keep the people i know from seeing the bruises. i am ashamed to tell
    anyone. he keeps saying he is sorry and promises it won''t happen again ... but
    it does. we have two children. we would have had three, but larry kicked me in
    the stomach when i was four months pregnant and i had a miscarriage. maybe it
    was a blessing because our children have a terrible life. they''re scared to death

    i am 10 years old and in fifth grade. all my life i have been chosen last. that''s
    my problem. p.e. is my least favorite class in school, not because i don''t like
    sports -- i enjoy them. but it is so humiliating always being chosen last. i dread
    going to school on days when i know we will have p.e. why can''t physical education
    teachers use a different system? p.e. teachers must have never had to experience
    what i have each day in p.e. i will go into the class again tomorrow to be chosen
    last. why don''t they just hang a sign on me that says, "reject. last one to pick
    gets me." i''m sure there are other kids who feel the same way. there is one in
    every p.e. class. it really hurts. my mom says not to let it bother me. she says
    she was always chosen last, too. i think she says that just to make me feel better.
    please don''t say, "practice the sport and you''ll be great at it and everyone
    will want you on their team." it doesn''t work that way. i''m kind of quiet, and
    even if you''re not bad at the sport, once you''ve been chosen last you will be
    last next week, the week after, and next year, too. i really, really, really hope
    you print this. i can''t bear to think i have to go to p.e. tomorrow. what can

  body: 'dear readers: today is thanksgiving day, so here''s my traditional thanksgiving
    column. take a few minutes to think about what you have to be thankful for. how''s
    your health? not so good? well, thank god you''ve lived this long. a lot of people
    haven''t. you''re hurting? thousands -- maybe millions -- are hurting more. (have
    you ever visited a veterans hospital? or a rehabilitation clinic for crippled
    children?) if you awakened this morning and were able to hear the birds sing,
    use your vocal cords to utter human sounds, walk to the breakfast table on two
    good legs and read the newspaper with two good eyes, praise the lord! a lot of
    people couldn''t. how''s your pocketbook? thin? well, most of the world is a lot
    poorer. no pensions. no welfare. no food stamps. no social security. in fact,
    one-third of the people in the world will go to bed hungry tonight. are you lonely?
    the way to have a friend is to be one. if nobody calls you, call someone. go out
    of your way to do something nice for somebody. it''s a sure cure for the blues.
    are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our system has been saved
    by such concern -- concern for fair play under the law. your country may not be
    a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds. freedom rings! look and listen.
    you can still worship at the church of your choice, cast a secret ballot, and
    even criticize your government without fearing a knock on the head or a knock
    on the door at midnight. and if you want to live under a different system, you
    are free to go. there are no walls or fences -- nothing to keep you here. as a
    final thought, i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer; perhaps you will want to use
    it at your table today: o, heavenly father, we thank thee for food and remember
    the hungry. we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless. we thank thee
    for freedom and remember the enslaved. may these remembrances stir us to service.
    that thy gifts to us may be used for others. amen. have a wonderful thanksgiving,
    and may god bless you and yours. -- love, abby an afterthought: want an instant
    high? the surest cure for the post-holiday blues is to do something nice for someone.
    why not call someone who lives alone and invite him (or her) over for dinner?
    better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that you get
    home." (many older people don''t drive, and those who do don''t like to go out
    alone after dark.) try it. and let me know the results. p.s. special greetings
    to those of you in the military who wrote from remote corners of the world to
    tell me that you are using my thanksgiving prayer on this thanksgiving day.'

    would never permit him to bother the neighbors. however, when i go out with my

    he had talked to a married woman in our complex about going fishing with him.

    i have ever met. we have a special, non-sexual relationship. she seems to be happily
    married and i can never hope to be with her other than at work, where we spend
    many hours together with little to do except talk to each other, entertain each
    other and -- well -- flirt. i know she enjoys my attentions, but i also know that
    sooner or later she''ll tire of this and crash me hard. i have been divorced for
    three years, and i doubt that any other woman would be willing to take on a divorced
    man who has weekend visitation with his daughters. i am attractive and intelligent,
    but very lonely, and my co-worker fills a big void. without her friendship, i''d
    have little sunshine in my life. how can i control my feelings and not be in love
    with another man''s wife? how can i keep my job, interact with a beautiful co-worker
    and keep my heart in check without hurting her or getting hurt? please answer
    soon. i can''t afford counseling. -- in love with a princess p.s. if any women

    i have a friend who believes himself to be quite intelligent. at every opportunity,
    he finishes sentences for anyone trying to speak. it seems as though he wants
    everyone to know that he has it "all figured out" ahead of time. it is annoying
    to have a great story ruined as he kicks in with the punch line (or a version
    of it) before the storyteller can finish. if someone says, "oh, you''ve heard
    it before," he will respond with, "oh, no," and laugh, covering his face with
    his hands, feigning embarrassment for his "blunder." (in most instances, i believe
    he has heard the story before.) isn''t this behavior rude? it is annoying to be
    constantly interrupted, or to have a good story ruined. how should i handle this?

    i have just returned from the dentist and i''m upset. the assistant who was working
    with him today has long hair -- well below shoulder-length. it was not pulled
    back or confined at all, which meant that whenever she leaned over, it was hanging
    right above my open mouth. she pushed it back behind her ears quite often. i may
    be terribly old-fashioned, but i consider this to be very unsanitary. i am a retired
    nurse. i was taught that even clean hair is to be considered "contaminated" and
    should never be touched while working with a patient unless you immediately scrub
    your hands. hair should be pulled back securely from the face whenever you are
    in a patient treatment or preparation area. i kept thinking about all the loose
    hairs that were being dropped on the counters, instruments and patients, and it
    made me sick. am i being too persnickety? could you please check with your dental
    experts and tell me if a dental assistant wearing long hair loose is acceptable?

    your advice to "good old dad," the father whose daughters bypassed him and talked
    only to their mother, was exactly right. i would like to add my own experience:
    i am the oldest daughter of eight children. when any of us called home and my
    dad answered the phone, he would barely say, "hello, how are you?" before passing
    the phone to my mother. when we visited, he''d sit and watch the ballgame while
    we talked with mom and filled her in on all our news. if we became too loud, he''d
    comment on our "yakking," just like "good old dad." although we loved him, we
    were never able to have a meaningful conversation with our father. then about
    10 years ago, my mother convinced dad -- against his better judgment -- to take
    a course in self-awareness. i received a phone call from him shortly after he
    completed the course, and we actually talked for about 10 minutes! he asked me
    questions, listened to my answers and spoke about himself. when i hung up the
    phone, tears were streaming down my face. my husband couldn''t believe it was
    my father i had been talking to. after that, dad made it a point to call all of
    his children and ask how they were doing. he also spent a little time with us
    when we visited. we grew much closer and discovered we really enjoyed each other''s
    company. dad passed away a few years ago, and i am so grateful to him for reaching
    out so we could have some time together before it was too late. abby, please tell
    "good old dad" that his daughters are dying to be close to him. he should call
    them at home or take them to lunch and build a relationship with them outside
    the mother-daughter loop. it may be a little awkward at first, but it will be
    well worth it. -- karen clark, holland, pa.'

    with my father. my father is a racist. he''s filled with hatred for blacks, jews,
    asians, even native americans (despite the fact that his own grandfather was a
    native american). somehow, i managed to grow up to be a very different person.
    to me, human diversity is a wonderful thing and a cause for celebration. my father''s
    use of offensive terms to refer to ethnic minorities has made being seen in public
    with him a humiliating experience. i have asked him repeatedly to refrain from
    using ethnic slurs in my presence, but he refuses to acknowledge that there is
    anything wrong with such terms. i get nervous when we go shopping or out to eat
    together, because he uses these words in public. it''s so embarrassing that i''m
    afraid to have friends into our home because of something he might say in front
    of them. i know my father will probably never overcome his hateful attitudes.
    i love him and want him to be part of my life, but i can no longer tolerate his
    racism. it is not only offensive to me, i''m afraid others will assume that i
    share his views, since most people''s values are shaped by the values of their

    help! my husband ("carl") and i have been married for 18 months. i have a 4-year-old
    son from a previous marriage and an infant daughter from this marriage. before
    i met carl, he had a one-night stand that resulted in a child (a little girl i''ll
    call sally). he and the mother of the child agreed a long time ago that sally
    would be legally adopted by the mother''s new husband (but carl hasn''t signed
    the papers yet). carl made the decision to have nothing to do with his daughter.
    i totally support him in that decision. carl and i have a loving and strong relationship.
    the problem is my mother-in-law. at our wedding reception, carl''s mother brought
    along pictures of sally and showed them to members of my family. somehow, the
    photographs got propped up against our wedding toast glasses next to our wedding
    cake. my husband confronted his mother. she turned it around and tried to make
    him feel guilty for ignoring the child. to this day she has never apologized for
    it. my mother-in-law showed pictures of sally to my son and told him she was his
    sister. she has asked me to visit the child and not tell my husband. she also
    has called me a "twit" (and worse), and told me that my husband was her son, and
    he loves her more than he loves me. carl and i have asked her not to see sally,
    but she insists she doesn''t need our permission to see her family. i am upset
    and very hurt by her attitude and actions. as a family, what should we do? --

    in reply to the advice you gave to "feeling unloved in st. cloud, minn.," whose
    husband wouldn''t touch her unless he had a drink first -- i''d like to share
    the other perspective: while she likes to tie quitting drinking to her husband''s
    reluctance to show his feelings, she is only partially correct. one of the greatest
    fears people have is rejection. rejection by the one you love is even worse. she
    should know that -- she feels it! imagine what it is like for her husband, who
    awakened several times in the night to find his wife out of the bed -- and in
    another bedroom. talk about rejection! the reason he doesn''t come to her bed
    for sex is he doesn''t want more rejection. only when he takes a drink does the
    fear subside. if she wants sex, why doesn''t she go to his bed? i''ve never yet
    seen a man refuse a woman''s advances. she should be glad he hasn''t moved out.
    most men would nowadays. someday when she''s a widow, she can look back at all
    the nights she didn''t hear and feel him in bed next to her. i know. i''m a "minnesota
    twin" to this guy. -- minnesota twin in beaver creek'

    i''ve got a big problem. it started when my friend "raymondo" got a divorce and
    left for new york with his new wife and his daughter last spring. we kept in touch
    with them for a while, and raymondo kept saying he didn''t like living up north
    and he wanted to return. finally he left his new wife and returned with his daughter.
    however, he had no place to live because he has no family here in the united states,
    and his former wife''s family wanted no part of him. we told raymondo he could
    stay with us until he found a job and earned enough money to rent an apartment.

    yesterday i went into a store that was having a sale. while i was there, i saw
    some tables that had decorative items for 50 percent off. i found two things i
    wanted. the sale amounted to less than $20, so i paid cash for them. before the
    salesman gave me my purchase, he demanded my name, address and telephone number.
    abby, this was a cash sale. he held my purchases until i reluctantly gave him
    my name and address. (i steadfastly refused to give him my telephone number, since
    it is unlisted.) this isn''t the first time i''ve had this happen with a cash

    children to an evening story-time and browsing through magazines and tapes after
    the program. mom or dad can drop by the library after work, and in a few minutes

    your letter to "sleepless, but not in seattle," struck a familiar note with me.
    my natural sleep rhythm also makes me a night owl. i have been like this as far
    back as i can remember, going to bed after midnight and waking up around 10 a.m.
    i was always teased about it, and my mother used to stand at the bottom of the
    stairs and sing, "lazy mary, will you get up?" now that i''m an adult, i get the
    same attitude from my husband. he''s snoozing in his recliner by 8 p.m. (nobody
    says he''s lazy), and i''m wide awake for four more hours. i even wear a nightshirt
    that says, "perky morning people should be shot!" i don''t know why "sleepless"
    should be considered to have a "condition" that can be relieved. she''s fine.
    she should find a job on the second shift and work from 3 p.m. to midnight, or

    "kate," my girlfriend of two years, and i recently had an argument that has left
    me questioning our entire relationship. i owned a 30-year-old classic car in mint
    condition that i purchased new at the factory. i took meticulous care of it and
    drove it only rarely. one day, kate drove my car out of her garage and broke a
    taillight and dented the side. she told me she would contact her insurance carrier
    and pay the $850 that i had received as a damage estimate. she later discovered
    her insurance didn''t cover the accident, and suggested i pay for it with my own
    accident coverage. i didn''t have that kind of insurance on the car, and told
    her that since she caused the damage, she should pay for it. she refused to pay,
    saying she couldn''t afford it, and a car shouldn''t come between two people who
    love each other. i finally paid for the repair myself, but was so soured over
    the issue that i sold the car. she now claims that since i sold the car, it''s
    really over with, and i should just forget the whole incident. whenever we discuss
    this issue, i become incensed at her irresponsibility and immaturity, and i have
    begun to wonder if this lack of character would manifest itself in other areas

    i am a single mother with a 15-year-old son i''ll call "johnny." i make a decent
    but modest living, and live in a simple home in keeping with my means. i try to
    set a good example for my son. my dilemma concerns my brother and his family.
    my brother and his wife were very helpful when johnny was small, keeping him when
    i had to work overtime. their son, "lyle," is the same age as johnny. in return,
    i''d take lyle to the park or on little trips with us so his parents could have
    time alone. when the boys were about 7, lyle started saying he didn''t like being
    at my house because it wasn''t clean enough for him. over the next five years,
    he''d make nasty comments to johnny, saying we were "white trash" -- but they
    had to be nice to us because we were family. he once said, "my parents said i
    should feel sorry for you." he put johnny down for just about everything, from
    the way he tied his shoes to the way he dressed. lyle often took advantage, and
    even stole money from him. i always invited lyle to johnny''s birthday parties,
    but johnny was invited to only one of lyle''s. at that party, none of the other
    mothers would talk to me. i overheard one say, "that''s the sister. i hear she''s
    kind of trashy." i know that the source of my nephew''s comments is his parents.
    we see each other occasionally at holiday time at our father''s house. my brother
    and his wife are friendly to my face, and i have no idea why they''d put us down
    in front of lyle. after the last incident with my nephew, i decided i''d had enough.
    we live three miles apart, but i haven''t called them in three years -- and they
    haven''t called me, either. abby, you often say that families should settle their
    differences. but that''s not always possible. these family members obviously don''t

    we are writing to let you know of the far-reaching effects of your operation dear

    wrote holiday cards as a class project. we sent hundreds of cards to the addresses
    listed in your column. as responses to their letters began to arrive, the daily
    question became, "is there any mail from the military?" servicemen and women from
    all over the globe wrote wonderful notes and letters to the students. some included
    pictures, patches and money from foreign countries where they were stationed.
    the activity also turned into geography lessons as students located on maps various
    home bases, current stations and stops in between. connections with weekly current
    events lessons made news come alive. the cards were greatly appreciated by the
    military people who received them, which is the obvious intent of operation dear
    abby. in addition, students had the experience of expressing their concern for
    others as well as patriotic pride. combining those benefits with the extra bonus
    of various classroom activities made this an invaluable activity we plan to repeat
    in the future. we are looking forward to the next operation dear abby. thank you

    my daughter, "lucy," and her girlfriend, "madelyn," are both 14. madelyn recently
    met a boy on the internet and began having regular "conversations" with him. her
    parents became concerned and forbade her to continue. i just found out that madelyn
    is now writing to the boy and using our address for him to answer her, so that
    her parents will not know. i told lucy this "boy" could easily be a child molester
    who preys on innocent young girls. at 14, they have no life experience, and madelyn
    believes everything she reads in his letters. i also found out that she has given
    him her real name and address, her phone number and our phone number over the
    internet. i am very concerned because all of us are working parents, and our daughters,
    both freshmen in high school, are home alone every day after school. my husband
    thinks i am worrying needlessly and should mind my own business. abby, my warning
    signals are flashing. should i tell madelyn''s parents? -- grace in tampa, fla.'

    "happy to be ron''s girl" boasted that she had good looks and brains and was happy
    to serve her man a good meal and show her love by doing his laundry. that''s fine

    four years ago, i met a man who fulfilled all my hopes and needs for a lifetime
    companion. we married a year later and have been happy in a new home and community.
    he''s 48 and i am 40. we''ve discussed starting a family. i have no children,
    but he has a 24-year-old son. we are both in excellent health and have discussed
    it with my ob-gyn, who sees us as capable of having a normal child. we are financially
    sound and would make loving parents. my dilemma lies with the negative comments
    we are getting from our families. my mother says we''d be selfish to have children
    at such an advanced age. his mother says there would be only heartache for our
    children because we will be "elderly" by the time they reach 20. my husband says
    the decision is ours, and we should be influenced only by what''s in our hearts
    -- not what others say. i have read about older couples who started families and
    had no regrets. i would like to hear from the children of older couples, children
    who were in high school when their parents were 60 and 70 years old. do the children
    have any regrets? i don''t want our children to feel cheated because we are older,
    or because we might not be able to do things with them that younger parents could
    do. if you would print this, it would help us make our decision to have a family

    you recently reprinted the test for alcoholism. some time back, when i found myself
    involved with a man i suspected had a drinking problem, i reviewed the test that
    i had seen in your column. since the answers to only three questions were yes
    (you stated that a "yes" answer to four of them pointed to alcoholism), i felt
    comfortable marrying him. however, in the past year, research has been done regarding
    binge drinking vs. full-blown alcoholism. the study found equal problems among
    both groups. i think your danger-signal list should be updated to reflect the
    following: -- do you have family members with addictive behavior, i.e., gambling,
    drugs, drinking? -- if you have minor children, have they frequently seen you
    drunk? -- if you have adult children, do you get drunk with them? -- are you able
    to drink more than most other people before getting drunk because you are "used
    to it"? -- when you reminisce about the "good times," are they almost exclusively
    drinking stories? -- do you seek recreational activities that revolve around drinking?
    -- when you are in a group, are you ever the only one drinking? -- do you frequently
    drink so much you are unable to perform sexually? -- have you been told that you
    become obnoxious when you''ve been drinking? -- do you drink and drive? abby,

    "frustrated 16-year-old in norfolk" implied she was denied an education because
    she left school and now has a baby. was this child enrolled in a public high school?
    did you call norfolk public schools to find out our policies on admitting teen
    mothers or dropouts? if you had, you would have known pregnant teens may attend
    their regular classes up to their due date, or attend a special school for pregnant
    girls where they receive intensive parenting education as well as their academic
    courses. once they have the baby, they return to their home school. we encourage
    dropouts to return to school -- either at their home school to pick up where they
    left off, or in a variety of alternative programs and sites. one program, the
    norfolk preparatory school, allows students to attend classes at night and earn
    credits at an accelerated pace so they can catch up with their peers. this program
    has helped many students earn their high school degree and prepare for further
    training either at a vocational school or a college. abby, are you certain the
    girl was truly denied admittance? my guess is she and her parents have not even
    been to school to enroll. if she did go and was denied enrollment, it was because
    of disciplinary action for fighting, possession of weapons or drugs, but certainly
    not for dropping out to have a baby. i am proud to be an 11-year veteran teacher
    in norfolk public schools. i have taught many students who have children at home,
    or teens who are returning to school after dropping out. we work hard to educate
    all segments of our urban population. we have excellent academic and vocational
    programs in place with an active, caring faculty to encourage our students to
    succeed. please be sure you correct the false negative impression this girl made

    24 hours later the detective called back with the news that he had my ring. no
    one to whom i have told this story has ever heard of the pawn shop squad, so a
    friend suggested i tell you about it. i''m assuming other cities have the same
    setup. a lot of jewelry is stolen in nursing homes. i''m just realizing much of
    it could be recovered if people knew enough to call this squad. the aide who was

    for 15 years, my marriage and family were fairly normal. then we moved back to
    be near my in-laws and help while my father-in-law was ill. two years ago, he
    died. and i have now lost my husband (i''ll call him jack) -- to his mother! he
    has become mama''s little boy again. my mother-in-law is an energetic, bright
    and creative woman. even when we lived far away, she tried to run his life, and
    that of our family. now that we live nearby, she completely runs and ruins everything.
    she buys the attention of our children with things that we can''t afford and really
    prefer they not have. she has time to cook elaborate meals, take the kids on trips,
    etc. she criticizes my cooking, my housekeeping, the way we discipline the children
    -- everything. and my husband, though he can manage a corporation, has never been
    able to stand up to his mother. almost every night she has something "new" to
    show one of the children. every night she has some little chore for jack to do.
    on weekends, she has already made plans for herself, my husband and the children.
    she makes it abundantly clear that i am not welcome to participate. i have suggested
    counseling for us, or at least talking to our pastor. since his mother doesn''t
    like our pastor, that got shot down. if i were to leave jack, it would be my fault,
    of course. abby, what does one do when the "other woman" is a man''s mother? --

    i am a 19-year-old girl and my best friend, cliff, is 21. we have been best friends
    for about three years and even tried dating, but it never worked for us. we agreed
    a long time ago that if we didn''t get married, we''d be in each other''s weddings.
    well, cliff is getting married next spring and has asked me to be his "best man."
    i accepted. he was originally going to have a male friend for his best man, and
    i was going to serve cake or take care of the guest book. but cliff decided he
    wants me to have the honor. my problem is that my mother doesn''t approve. she
    and my dad were married in 1967 and still believe in the traditional way of doing
    things. i called several bridal shops and was told that i won''t be the first
    woman to be a "best man." cliff''s fiance, his mother and the rest of the wedding
    party are all for it. cliff adores my parents. he calls them "mamma" and "dad."
    he values their opinion as much as i do, but we both want me to be his best man.

    is a journal in which she has written her feelings and experiences -- in shockingly
    vulgar language. according to the diary, she has had many sexual encounters with
    three boys. when i revealed what i had read to her father, he was devastated.
    we have had talks with stacy about sex, but apparently to no avail. we fear that
    if we confront her, she''ll stop spending weekends with us. her father and i know
    that her mother must be told what''s going on, but stacy is sure to feel betrayed

    natural efforts. i know he loves me and i do not expect him to prove it by putting
    the pillow under my feet as i put them up. any woman who aspires to shirking domestic
    duties she should be proud to accomplish can be summed up in one word: lazy. it
    is not a matter of women "serving" or men needing "survival skills." relationships
    are about wanting to take care of your partner and making each day easier for
    him. relationships are meant to be about "us." too many partners in relationships
    these days ask the question, "what can you do for me?" as opposed to, "how can
    i help you?" there is something wrong with this lack of selflessness, and quite
    possibly people have forgotten the definition of "true love." if two people really
    care for each other, there should be no thought of tit-for-tat. acts performed
    from the heart all equal out in the end. -- happy to be ron''s girl, 1997'

    "i''ll bet you don''t remember me, do you?" i dread hearing that question, and
    i''m sure other schoolteachers do, too. after 34 years (so far) in the classroom,
    i simply can''t remember the names of all my former students. answering "no" diminishes
    the initial joy we both should feel in recalling that relationship. this deflating

    or trivial conversation. when i sit down to read, i read in minute-and-a-half
    blocks of time because i know she will interrupt me. even when she isn''t in the

    my husband and i had different reactions to a couple we know. i''ll call them
    "jack and jill." my husband considers jack to be one of his best friends, so he
    asked him to be his best man in our wedding. shortly after we announced our engagement,
    my parents threw a party for us, inviting only family and those in our wedding
    party. it was such a special event that my husband''s parents flew across the
    country to be there. much to my husband''s dismay, jack and jill never showed
    up. when we saw them a few days later, they explained that they had made other
    plans. a few months before the wedding, my sister planned a bridal shower for
    me. jill was invited. she never came. i saw her that evening and she said that
    she forgot. this really hurt my feelings. about a month before the wedding, a
    couple of the groomsmen called me to find out about the bachelor party. i called
    jack, and he said he had not made any plans yet. it got closer to the wedding
    (a week away) and a groomsman, one of my bridesmaids and i were working frantically
    to give my husband a bachelor party. we asked jack to take care of the transportation
    deposit. the night before the bachelor party, the bus driver called my bridesmaid
    and told her that he never received his deposit (which had been given to jack).
    we then had to track jack down and get the deposit to the bus company. luckily,
    the party went well. the same evening, we had my bachelorette party. jill never
    showed up. the rehearsal evening finally came. jack and jill showed up at the
    church 30 minutes late, with no explanation. luckily, my husband asked jack to
    come to our house to get ready for the wedding so he would be there on time. last
    week we got our wedding album back. we decided to have a barbecue and invite everyone
    in the wedding party. jack and jill accepted. two hours after the barbecue started,
    they called to say they weren''t coming. my dilemma: i do not want to make any
    more plans with this couple because they make no effort to see us. my husband
    thinks i am being mean when i tell him not to invite them to any of our functions.

    i was baffled by your response to "stressed out in whitehall, pa.," who wrote
    to you concerning a piano that her sister had given her seven years before and
    now wanted returned. you practically ignored the piano issue, which was the point
    of the woman''s letter, advising her to return it -- and then went on to give
    her an abundance of information about the chronic fatigue syndrome she mentioned
    she was suffering from. although i''m sure "stressed out" appreciated your concern
    for her health, she wrote to you about the piano. why should she, immediately
    upon her sister''s request, return a piano that was given to her and that she
    had kept for seven years? you excused the sister''s rude actions by stating that
    she may have been unaware of "stressed out''s" illness. regardless of her health,

    in the past three or four months, i have heard that a new addiction is about to
    be exposed in our society: sexual addiction. just a few months ago on abc''s television
    news magazine "20/20," they devoted an entire segment to this subject. i have
    been suspicious of my husband for years, but because of his ongoing difficulties
    with marijuana, alcohol, nitrous oxide, cocaine, and prescription diet and pain
    medications, i thought maybe the interest in sexually explicit magazines, movies,
    etc., just went with the territory. after the last go-around with chemical problems,
    he threw out all the pornography. i was relieved; then i recently discovered more
    hidden magazines. they are not the kind one picks up at the corner convenience
    store. from what i''ve been able to ascertain, my sexual appetite is normal, but
    his seems insatiable. when we''ve been on vacation, relaxing and paying undivided
    attention to one another (no kids or interruptions), we can make love three or
    four times a day. and if i don''t want to do it again a fifth time, according
    to him i have a problem! often when he comes up to me to kiss me, he will grab

    may i add my story to your acts of kindness? two years ago, a friend who now lives
    in israel came to visit me with her family. i had known her from my hometown back
    in orleans, france. one evening, while i was surrounded by my grown children and
    my husband, she told me a story that i had never heard. she said my father (leon
    levenson), now deceased, had saved the lives of her entire family -- seven people
    -- during world war ii by helping them hide their jewish identity in order to
    avoid being killed by the invading nazis. after hearing this story, i realized
    that my father, who was short in stature, had been a giant among men and was truly
    one of those "unsung heroes" who never tell their stories. i thank god for the
    opportunity to have known such a person in my lifetime. -- betie newton, glendale,

    i was upset when i read the letter from "sally b." about bra straps. however,
    when i read the comments from other readers, i was furious! i am a 50-year-old
    woman who wears a 34dd bra. last year, i consulted a surgeon about breast reduction,
    but was told he wouldn''t be able to take off enough for my insurance to pay for
    it. he told me he would have to take off 5 ounces in order for them to pay for
    it -- and he could only remove 4 ounces without making me look bottom-heavy. they
    go by the average woman''s height, which is 5 feet, 4 inches. i am only 5 feet
    tall, so until i can grow more chest, i''m out of luck. during the hot summer
    months, wearing a bra is uncomfortable to say the least. i envy women who don''t
    have to. the bras made to wear with tank tops have elastic straps. they don''t
    work. someone my size looks like a cow. sure, having one made would do the trick,
    but a $50 bra is not in my budget. if i had that kind of money, i''d have the
    surgery. wasn''t it said somewhere, "judge not lest ye be judged"? i''d be more
    than happy to let one of these flat-chested shrews walk a mile on a hot day with

    i am 17 years old and live with my grandmother because my mother and i don''t
    get along. my problem started two years ago when my father passed away. after
    only six months, my mother started dating "allen." i thought it was too soon.
    mom is very pretty. i know she can''t live alone forever, but i don''t think she
    had to grab the first man who came along. i wasn''t sure how allen would treat
    us, so i thought it would be better for me to move away. now that i have met him
    and see the way he treats both my mother and my brother, i have no problem with
    him. every time i go visit them i have a great time. but now they are talking
    about getting married. i''m not sure of the date, but i think it''s getting close.
    after my father died, mom said she would remain a "smith" (not our real last name)
    for the rest of her life. now she''s talking about marrying and changing her name!
    i don''t see why they have to get married. i think it will change their relationship
    for the worse. i told her that when they do get married, i won''t be there. maybe
    i shouldn''t be that way, but that''s the way i feel. what should i do? should
    i accept the fact that they may get married and be happy, or what? i''m confused.

    that he let me change things around the house a little. his response: "what for?
    everything is in its place. besides, we''re moving anyway." what shall i do? he
    does not see things the way i do because he is not hurting emotionally. i have

    if i need to get a job, i should try to get one right now. one other thing: he
    thinks money is everything. but i have proven to him that money is not everything
    to me by signing a prenuptial agreement wherein i get nothing. however, he always

    and if he continues living a healthy lifestyle, he could live a fairly normal

    was said about it. we have socialized with them throughout the year and really

    to time. my husband and i began wearing nightclothes when our first child was
    nearing 2 because we were both raised to believe that exposing oneself to children
    was harmful. yet i keep wondering if it is so harmful, why is this family so well-adjusted?

    i am a single woman who has been dating a very nice man for the past year. he
    is a perfect gentleman, intelligent, kind, comfortably retired and has many friends.
    this relationship could lead to marriage. we enjoy each other''s company and like
    to do the same things. the only thing holding me back is his language. he uses
    terms like "dis, dat and dem" for "this, that and them." this may seem childish,
    but i just can''t accept the way he speaks. sometimes i am embarrassed when we
    are with friends. should i tell him how i feel? he is such a nice person, but
    i think i will probably quit seeing him because of the language problem. sign

    i am very worried about my 32-year-old son. i''ll call him "rob." he is the oldest
    of three sons, all of whom still live at home. my two younger sons are doing well.
    however, rob is very shy and solitary. he was fired from each of the three jobs
    he has held (as a computer programmer) -- ostensibly for being slow. he was advised
    by one of his supervisors to get into toastmasters. he never did. he lost his
    most recent job almost a year and a half ago. he now seems to be in a rut and
    has made no effort to find employment. his only social contact apparently is a
    weekly bike ride with his bike club. i work, so i am out of the house five days
    a week. he has continued to pay room and board, as he had considerable savings.
    however, those savings are now drying up, and i cannot and will not pay his car
    insurance bill when it''s due. i keep urging him to get his resume up-to-date
    and start looking for work. he doesn''t even glance at the help-wanted ads. his
    brothers have both expressed the opinion that he needs therapy -- but doesn''t
    he have to want to get help for himself? two months ago i set a time limit of
    six weeks in which he had to be "actively seeking employment" or move in with
    his father. he did nothing except work on his resume a minimal amount. he justifies
    his lack of action by saying that he just keeps procrastinating. i did not enforce
    the penalty and make him move out. i have a feeling he''ll wait until he''s almost
    broke and this may spur him into action. but then i worry that he may get fired
    all over again and his confidence will suffer even more. i feel i should do something
    for him, but i''m not sure what. any suggestions you could offer would be tremendously
    appreciated. -- worried mother, north hollywood, calif.'

    after reading your column on first cousins marrying, i thought i''d better let
    you know the downside: when it doesn''t work out. i was also involved with a "kissing
    cousin" many years ago, and there are consequences one doesn''t think of until
    it''s too late. to start with, you fight to get the other family members to accept
    that you''re involved with each other. then, when it goes sour and you can''t
    stand to be around each other, who do you turn to? from experience i can tell
    you: no one! you suffer in silence because everyone told you it would not work
    out and you wouldn''t listen. i can tell you, it''s easier to break off a relationship
    with an outsider than with a relative. it''s 100 times harder when it''s family.
    you cause divisions and pain when you get together, and it''s worse when you split.
    there''s more pain than you could ever imagine for both those involved and the
    families. you are expected to attend family functions and pretend it never happened,
    to be polite and try to be civil to each other even though you''re dying inside
    and, wish as you may, you can never go back to "before." please advise anyone
    contemplating a relationship with a relative. think long and hard before you leap.

    my best friend, "heather," has two children -- a boy and a girl. the oldest, "mark,"
    is 4, and he is a problem. mark has never been disciplined and makes me very uncomfortable
    when i visit with my friend. he always gets into my purse, no matter where i put
    it. if i put it up high, he will climb to get it. his mother sits back and does
    nothing. on more than one occasion when i spoke up and told him not to look in
    my purse, mark kicked me, and it''s not unusual for him to call me names. his
    mother never opens her mouth when he does this. recently, heather told mark to
    go take his nap, but he kept coming out of his room again and again. finally,
    heather told him that if he didn''t stay in his room and go to sleep, he could
    not go to the market with her later. he paid no attention to her -- and you guessed
    it, he was allowed to go shopping with his mother anyway. this child wears the
    pants in this family. abby, i fear that mark will grow up with no respect for
    his parents or anyone else. he is already a bully and a bad influence on his younger
    sister, but i could never tell his parents it''s their fault mark does not behave.

    does. i feel terrible that i don''t want this child in my home, but it''s like

    i think you missed the boat with "not everyone''s mom." in today''s world, it
    does take a village to raise a child, and if "not everyone''s mom" doesn''t feel
    up to it, she should opt out. rather than bronzing a plaque of rules for parents,
    "mom" should deal directly with the children. 1. don''t want kids for hours on
    end or as dinner/holiday guests? send ''em home! children are not psychic. most
    aren''t sensitive enough to get subtle hints like, "time to wash up and set the
    table." 2. encourage them to help you garden. there is nothing like a sense of
    ownership to foster pride. 3. take time to teach. there''s nothing wrong with
    house rules like, "at our house we don''t call names," or, "here we use ''please''
    and ''thank you.''" set limits for acceptable behavior. it may take many repetitions
    to get results. be patient, but firm. i have given up my lawn and most of my garden
    for now. the few short years of childhood are worth more than a few blades of

    i own a very busy neighborhood retail newsstand/convenience store. we serve a
    few hundred customers a day -- more men than women, for some reason. while our
    male customers generally dig into their pockets for bills or coins when paying,
    women usually bring out their wallets and open them to get cash. this is a dangerous
    practice. when women open their wallets and reveal credit cards and the driver''s
    license in the window pocket, i get a good look at personal information -- as
    do customers standing beside or behind them. it may take only a few seconds to
    get money out of the wallet, but it takes me less time to read their names and
    addresses. it may seem like a reasonable place to keep your license in order to
    find it quickly should an officer ask for it, but most officers ask that the license
    be removed from the wallet anyway. i have made my family and friends aware of
    the danger, and have moved my wife''s license to a safer location in her wallet.
    i am reluctant to point out this danger to my customers because they may feel
    "funny" about my noticing. however, i worry that someone who is unstable or dangerous
    may obtain names and addresses -- and then who knows what will happen? i propose

    baby, and that i won''t sign the birth certificate unless our son has a name we

    which he is being given only aspirin, and is receiving no treatment at all for
    the cancer. i have talked to the warden and the medical staff at the prison, to
    no avail. "i know my father broke the law. but he is now completely immobile,
    his weight is down to 105 pounds, and he spends his days wracked with pain. i
    realize there is no excuse for breaking the law, but i don''t think a first-time
    offender should pay with his life the way my father is. "i have spent hundreds
    of dollars on phone calls, faxes and letters, but haven''t found anyone who will
    help. my father doesn''t have long to live. i want him near so i can give him
    the love and care he deserves until his time is up and he has gone on to a better
    place. what can i do?" abby, i was shocked when you phoned me after you received
    my letter. you suggested i speak to judy greenspan, director of the catholic charities
    of the east bay hiv/aids in prison project in oakland, calif. your call was the
    first ray of hope i had received. with ms. greenspan''s painstaking effort, my
    father was finally released from prison. he was so ill by then that he had to
    be placed immediately in the hospital. i was by his side when he passed away one
    week later. his last moments were peaceful. thank you from the bottom of my heart.
    because of you and ms. greenspan, my father didn''t have to die alone. his last
    days were spent in relative comfort, surrounded by loving family. -- c.s. in tulare,

    i am a sophomore in college. last summer i met a wonderful young man. he gave
    me his phone number, and a week later, we went on our first date. when he asked
    me out for a second date, i accepted. in the months that followed, he became the
    love of my life. we fell in love and i became part of his family. we found everything
    we had been looking for in each other. he was the first to mention marriage and
    having a family -- he even talked about where he''d like us to live. he promised
    nothing would ever come between us. after all these promises, he just informed
    me that his career is his no. 1 priority now, and he doesn''t have time for me.
    his change of heart came about abruptly, and i don''t know why. i am devastated.

    i think you were way off base in your response to "conservative mom." she asked
    if she should talk with her 19-year-old college-age daughter about a receipt for
    the hotel room she had found bearing the names of her daughter and her daughter''s
    boyfriend. you told the mother that her daughter is an adult who has a right to
    make her own decisions. i wonder if this "adult" is paying her way through college.
    is she fully on her own, having cut the umbilical cord to her parents'' purse
    strings? is she so wise and worldly at 19 that she knows everything there is to
    know about dating and sex? the hotel receipt could have provided an opportunity
    for the mother to bring up the subject of dating and sex and to perhaps share
    her own dating experiences with her daughter. my wife and i are both 31, and she
    has a 19-year-old sister in college. when we learned that she had been sleeping
    over at her boyfriend''s, we made it clear that we thought it was a bad idea because
    others in her dorm would assume they were having sex, even though she said "nothing"
    was happening. should we have kept silent until she became pregnant because she''s
    an "adult"? i only thought i was wise and worldly at 19. parents need to set examples,
    abby. to think that a 19-year-old is an adult in every sense of the word is ridiculous.
    everyone can use some guidance once in a while, especially in this day and age
    when promiscuity seems to be widely accepted. to say that "conservative mom" has
    no business in her daughter''s personal affairs and should not offer advice is

    my problem isn''t the embarrassment of someone seeing me in the nude; it goes

    have been just inches away from my window, as you rarely see the vertical blinds.
    the video covers my whole morning routine, from going to the bathroom, brushing
    my teeth, shaving and 15 minutes in the shower. this was far from a video that
    was shot from a distance. there were close-ups that filled the television screen.

    i have been married for 27 years. two years ago, my husband was laid off from
    his job after 31 years. i had always saved our money, and lived with an eye toward
    the future. we had taken out loans occasionally at my husband''s credit union.
    each time he got a raise, i''d put some of it away for that "rainy day." one saturday
    when the mail arrived, there was a letter in it from the credit union saying my
    husband was two payments behind on a loan. when he returned from playing golf,
    i told him i''d seen the dun and it was a mistake; it had to be his brother''s.
    (his brother also worked for the same company.) i said if that''s the way they
    did business, i''d meet him on monday and we''d withdraw all our money and put
    it into another bank. the following monday, on my way to work, we met at the place
    the company had set up for outplaced employees. my husband seemed nervous and
    said we needed to talk. he then informed me that the $75,000 to $80,000 that was
    supposed to be in the account was gone. he had spent the money. i had been able
    to deal with his losing his job and my going to work full time, but this was too
    much. i exploded. i asked him what he''d done with the money. he said he spent
    it on the family. well, abby, i know what kind of lifestyle we have lived, and
    we have nothing to show for that amount of money. we went to counseling. i thought
    i was losing my mind. i loved this man, had his two children, and have never been

    to know was what he had done with the money. my husband insisted he didn''t know
    what he had spent the money on. things went from bad to worse. then i found girlie

    i agree with "sally b." who finds exposed bra straps absolutely disgusting and

    you can walk into virtually any department store (even discount stores) and find
    bras of all shapes, styles and colors designed to function invisibly under almost
    any type of garment on the market. many bras have convertible straps so they can
    be worn x-back, halter-style, one strap or strapless. they make bustiers to be
    worn under backless dresses, and when all else fails, they have ones like giant
    lace band-aids so one doesn''t "jiggle." so the only excuse for exposed bras straps
    is plain laziness. i''d like to add my pet peeve: white bras showing plainly through
    thin blouses. don''t these women know flesh tones exist? i hate seeing professional
    women who wear beautiful white blouses ruining the effect because their undergarments

    i have been married for three years and love my husband dearly; however, i''m
    very close to leaving him. why? because i feel invisible. i''m a good wife and
    do everything within my power to make him happy, but when he comes home from work,
    he greets me with a "hi" -- then he greets our three dogs with petting and words
    of love. this infuriates me! it''s so painful i have to leave the room. as of
    three months ago, my husband decided he sleeps better without me, so we''ve been
    sleeping apart. i know he works hard at his job, and it''s important for him to
    get a good night''s sleep, but that''s no excuse for his behavior toward me. our
    sex life has practically come to a halt. i expressed my feelings to him, only
    to be ignored. when i get affectionate with him, he pushes me away saying, "not
    now, honey, i''m too tired." abby, i don''t claim to be the perfect wife, but
    the house is always immaculate and the laundry is never piled up. i make hot meals
    daily and our pets are well-groomed and cared for. i am not drop-dead gorgeous,
    but i get my share of looks and remarks. i will not seek what i need from other
    men, but i won''t spend the rest of my life in a marriage that consists of domestic
    duties and nothing more. my husband never misses your column. hopefully, he''ll
    see my letter, realize how hurt i am, and change his ways. sign me ... desperate

    law enforcement officers and their actions have been and always will be targets
    for criticism, skepticism and controversy. two of the most newsworthy topics involving
    law officers are the use of physical force and deadly force on criminals. it is
    easy for the general public or the media to second-guess what was right or wrong.
    they have hours or days to do it -- while an officer has only seconds. the stakes
    are high on the street. hesitation or a wrong decision may very well cost an officer
    his/her life. this brings me to a recent letter you published: "wayne in santa
    rosa, calif." said he thinks cops should carry tranquilizer guns instead of firearms.
    well, wayne, in our "wild kingdom," the animals -- a.k.a. car-jackers, armed robbers
    and drug dealers -- carry guns. real guns. and they do not hesitate to use them
    on innocent people, as well as on cops. the animals you see on "wild kingdom"
    are potentially dangerous because they are instinctively trying to protect their
    lives or the lives of their offspring. the "animals" we deal with are predators
    -- preying on innocent, honest citizens, and they are dangerous because they choose
    to be. abby, it''s obvious that wayne is ignorant of how violent these people
    can be, and how quickly a situation can turn on an officer in any given situation.
    i can only suggest that he get a job in law enforcement, because i''m sure his
    outlook on tranquilizer guns would change. law enforcement can always use good
    advice on how to improve. most of us and our bosses welcome good advice. but tranquilizer
    guns? i''m 30 years old, have been a cop for eight years, and i thought i''d heard
    it all. -- cpl. donald palliser, st. tammany parish sheriff''s office, covington,

    i recently had major surgery. after the operation, my surgeon advised me that

    all have a similar problem. here is my dilemma: when i was in college, i foolishly
    had an affair with an older man and became pregnant. i couldn''t support a child

    my 3-year-old son recently threw a tantrum in a large department store. i had

    re the judge and ph.d. who were planning their wedding and wanted to know how
    they should be properly announced at the ceremony: in my opinion, your advice
    was off the mark. in this day and age of women keeping their own names and having
    their own titles, announcing them as "mr. and mrs. hisfirstname hislastname" is
    inappropriate. this portion of the ceremony is about the new status of the couple
    and their "new names." while it''s true that the wedding is "about the two of
    you becoming husband and wife, not judge and doctor," it is also true that becoming
    husband and wife is not about the wife''s being called mrs. hisfirstname hislastname
    anymore. or even about the titles of "mr." or "mrs." where those are not applicable.
    how about omitting this outdated "announcement" of new names and identities altogether?
    is there any reason the presentation cannot be along the lines of, "let''s welcome
    john and sally, husband and wife," or eliminated entirely? -- florida lawyer'

    "sir," said the sheriff, "that is a full-stop sign." "son," said the farmer, "i''ve

    bit of difference between ''stop'' and ''slow down.''" "well, sir," said the sheriff,
    "i''m going to show you the difference." he hauled out his nightstick and began

    be better off without him. he''s not in the best of health and has no one to look
    after him, and i wonder if my conscience would bother me if i broke up with him.

    in 1985, i met a woman i grew to care for very much. she and her 9-year-old son
    from a previous marriage moved into my home. within weeks, without prior discussion
    with me, she became pregnant and quit her job. for the next four years i supported
    her, our child and her older son, even though she was collecting child support
    from her former husband. after counseling and considerable agony, it became obvious
    that this woman was a user and incapable of a healthy relationship. she moved
    out in 1989, and we worked out a joint-custody arrangement for our 3-year-old
    son "josh." i was required to pay her $600 a month in child support. a year later
    she disclosed that she had been addicted to drugs the entire time we were together.
    while i supported her son, she had spent his support check on drugs. during the
    last seven years, she started, but never completed, several drug rehabilitation
    programs, and she has frequently uprooted the children as she moved from relationship
    to relationship and place to place. all the while, i''ve been paying child support
    and giving her thousands of dollars besides. one recent afternoon, she came by
    my office to pick up the child-support check and mentioned she''d moved in with
    another boyfriend and was living rent-free. she was proud that josh finally had
    a room of his own, but mentioned that he was sleeping on the floor because he
    didn''t have a bed. i said, "wait a minute ... you''ve been collecting child support
    for seven years, living rent-free for the past several months, and josh is sleeping
    on the floor? you haven''t bought him something as basic as a bed?" she replied,
    "i needed that money to square myself away." then she added, "and you know what?
    i can spend that money on anything i want and legally there''s nothing you can
    do about it!" josh confirmed this on the way home from school later that day,
    but defended his mom and said, "it''s ok, dad. i have a (borrowed) sleeping bag."
    it broke my heart. (josh now has a bed.) abby, while a lot of attention is focused

    i work in a domestic violence/sexual assault center in pennsylvania. after reading
    the letter from "sick and tired of voluntary victims in oregon," may i offer some
    facts? women who are in abusive relationships are not "stupid." abuse is sinister
    and can sneak into a relationship. getting out is difficult because many women
    have strong emotional attachments to their partners, and don''t want to acknowledge
    that they are being abused. abusers are highly manipulative. they may repeatedly
    promise never to do it again, threaten suicide if the woman leaves, threaten to
    harm the kids if she leaves, or not allow her to hold a job so she cannot save
    money to escape. they also may deny her access to transportation. sometimes the
    abuse begins when the woman becomes pregnant. many women in abusive relationships
    have no choice about whether to use birth control, especially if the man controls
    the finances and doesn''t allow her enough money to purchase birth control. also,
    women in abusive relationships may not have the option to say no to sex. as for
    the women who manage to leave -- a few statistics: studies in philadelphia and
    chicago reveal that almost one-fourth of women killed by male partners were separated
    or divorced and 28.6 percent of the women were attempting to leave the relationship.
    according to the pennsylvania coalition against domestic violence, 75 percent
    of domestic violence homicides occur after separation. also, women who call police
    may encounter responses such as, "be a better wife and he won''t have to hit you."
    abuse is about power and control -- keeping the woman from having freedom of choice.
    i suggest that "sick and tired" look into the issue. go to the library and check
    out the women''s studies section. it will provide current information about violence
    against women. better yet, call your local domestic violence shelter and volunteer.

    with all the support you provide to our servicemen and women through operation
    dear abby, perhaps you''d like to tell your readers that the uso is still alive
    and well. the united services organization, which is non-profit and receives no
    funding from the government, was founded in 1941 during world war ii. my 17-year-old
    twin daughters and i volunteer at the uso puget sound area military center at
    the seattle international airport. people say, "oh, is uso still around? we thought
    that was a world war ii thing." well, it is still around, because we still have
    men and women in uniform (most of the armed services today are volunteers), who
    have chosen to protect our country and "stand on the wall of freedom." my daughters
    and i feel honored to serve them, to show them the american people appreciate
    them and what they are doing for our country. even in peacetime, servicemen and
    women risk their lives daily. last february, three coast guardsmen lost their
    lives off the coast of washington while rescuing a sailboat in trouble. it really
    brought home the fact that servicemen and women today, whether in a peacekeeping
    situation like bosnia or routine jobs at military installations around the world,
    are "in the line of fire" constantly. uso stays open thanks to the efforts of
    volunteers who give of their time and money, and organizations who donate items
    and money to provide refreshments, a quiet place away from the airport terminals
    and -- many times -- information to help them to get to their next duty station.
    whether the person who walks through that center door is a 17-year veteran of
    the services or a new recruit fresh out of boot camp, these people need our respect
    and appreciation. as a proud volunteer at the uso, i ask your help in informing
    your readers that uso exists and needs their support. -- wendy flores, seattle'

    i have lived in an upstairs apartment for seven years. it is convenient to where
    both my spouse and i work. the rent is affordable, and we have a good relationship
    with our landlord. the problem? two years ago he rented the office directly downstairs
    to a woman who chain-smokes. he told her when she rented it that he had a no-smoking
    policy. (i don''t know if it was written into her lease or not.) she has ignored
    the no-smoking policy since day one. after four or five requests from me that
    she not smoke, she replied that i would "just have to open a window." abby, opening
    a window does nothing. our rugs and furniture stink. the clothes in our closet
    stink. our throats tickle, our eyes burn, and i hate to think of the long-term
    effects on the health of our 3-year-old daughter. after the "just open a window"
    comment, i went to our landlord. he told her in no uncertain terms that she was
    not to smoke in the building. she stopped briefly, then started again. back to
    the landlord i went. she stopped briefly once again, then started again. back
    to the landlord again. now, she simply denies that she''s smoking (there''s no
    doubt that she does), and i am tired of bothering our landlord. the building is
    very old and nothing short of demolition would keep the smell from drifting up
    here. the floors are hardwood. i love this place for its rustic charm, and have
    put a lot of work into making it a pleasant and comfortable home. abby, does she
    have the right to smoke? don''t i have the right to keep my home smoke-free? i
    am a happy person, but she''s making my life miserable. -- frustrated in st. pete''s

    "roger" and i have been married more than 40 years. i feel we have a good marriage.
    we have recently retired and moved to the city where roger grew up. there''s a
    lady here i''ll call "mitzi." roger dated mitzi all through high school and was
    engaged to her for at least three years after that. from what i can put together,
    they had a very intimate relationship. mitzi sent roger a "dear john" letter while
    he was in the military, which i assumed he probably deserved. (i was in no way
    involved.) mitzi has been married to the same man for more than 40 years. over
    the past four decades, we have attended the same social functions about six times.
    each time, she and roger always seem to visit at least 15 or 20 minutes, and while
    he''s talking to her he completely ignores me. in fact, he turns his back on me
    as though he''s ashamed of me. do you think there is any unfinished business between
    them? i would like to give him a surprise birthday party. because of the people
    i will be inviting, it will be necessary to also invite mitzi and her husband.

    you''re too hot, then so is your dog, who''s wearing a fur coat. and remember,

    i have been a sexually active male since puberty, but i never took protection
    seriously. then, two years ago, i learned that an older friend of mine had been
    diagnosed with hiv. his wife had it before they met. they are an average family,
    with the house, the kids, the dog, and church every sunday. just plain good people
    -- with hiv. that made me sit down and think hard. no more running around for
    me! i''m in my early 20s -- too young to die. i found a girlfriend who was not
    sexually active. she told me she had been intimate with only one person, and only
    one time. we dated steadily for a year and a half before we engaged in intercourse.
    it lasted only about 30 seconds before she said, "this isn''t right -- we should
    be married!" then she put her clothes back on. about a month later i noticed a
    bump on my penis, then two bumps, then three. i went to the clinic for medical
    treatment, and was tested for hiv and all the other sexually transmitted diseases,
    and was given treatment for genital warts. it was a very painful procedure where
    acid was applied to the affected area. over the course of a week the bumps fell
    off, leaving open, bleeding sores. i was told genital warts are a serious problem.
    it is a virus, meaning i will have to get treatments and watch for outbreaks until
    my dying day. for a woman, it is worse. it hides, unexposed, with no symptoms.

    i am responding to "fed up in huntsville, ala.," who said that after four years
    of marriage her 70-year-old husband wants only to eat, sleep and sit. abby, this
    woman is describing the typical symptoms of depression in the elderly, which often
    goes unnoticed. i have been witness to this in my own family. i tolerated similar
    behavior in my 73-year-old husband who had already had two heart attacks. one
    day he cried out in anguish, "why doesn''t god take me right now?" only then did
    i realize his "lazy" behavior was not voluntary. we saw a doctor the next day.
    my husband is now taking anti-depressants and is so thankful that he feels better.
    our active life has resumed, he is once again playing golf, and we are even doing
    some traveling! my only regret is that i did not recognize his problems sooner.
    i am ashamed to admit that i am a registered nurse. i hope my experience will
    help other senior citizens realize they may need help. -- an r.n. in florida'

    three years ago, my 58-year-old husband had a brief affair with his secretary.
    it was no secret; all the tongues in this little town were wagging a mile a minute.
    once, when i found a motel key in his coat pocket, he had the gall to tell me
    that he got tired of driving, so he checked into a motel to take a little nap.
    (three miles from home!) well, last year he had some surgery that left him impotent,
    and since then, i couldn''t ask for a more devoted husband. he sends me flowers,
    and phones if he knows he''s going to be half an hour late. he even takes me on

    i am deeply disturbed by something i see every day on the streets and roads. last
    week i was driving behind a couple in a sports vehicle. a boy who could not have
    been more than 3 years old was with them, standing in the back seat with his head
    halfway out the window. i am a mother and know what it''s like to have your child
    cry and tell you that you''re mean because you want the child strapped in a car
    seat. but believe me, i would much rather hear my child cry and be upset for a
    few minutes than to lie awake at night asking god to forgive me for causing his
    death by giving in because he didn''t want to be strapped in. i don''t understand
    how a parent can be so careless, but i see it all the time. i''m not sure what
    to do about it. should i try to catch up to them and tell them how dangerous it
    is? or should i call the police on my car phone? i would like to tell every parent
    in the world to tell the child who is resisting being buckled in, "no, you cannot
    ride without being buckled in -- i love you too much to endanger you!" abby, please
    print my letter. i can''t bear the thought of another little life being lost because
    someone failed to safeguard a child in his or her car. -- shannon m. barrett,

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i have two children of my own, but some days i feel as though i have 10 or 12.
    there are many children in the neighborhood where i live. the following is some
    information for my neighbors. i call it the common rules of parental etiquette:
    1. i am not the neighborhood baby sitter. sending your children to my house for
    several hours does not absolve you of the responsibility of checking on your children
    on a regular basis. 2. please do not allow your children to pick the flowers i
    took the time and money to plant. if your children come home with flowers plucked
    from someone else''s garden, explain to them the dishonesty of their act, even
    though it seems like a sweet thing for them to have done. and, by the way, since
    i''m the only one with certain varieties of flowers in my garden, pleading ignorance
    as to where they came from won''t work. also, breaking down my bushes and plants
    with balls and bats is not acceptable. 3. foisting your children off on me for
    several hours and then, later the same day, refusing to allow my child into your
    home to play because "my child already has a friend over" doesn''t work for me.
    it also sets the wrong example for your child. the message it gives is: "you can
    use anyone you want and not give anything in return." 4. memorial day, labor day
    and fourth of july mean picnics and parties for family and friends. if i''m having
    a party and your child wasn''t invited, please keep him home! last year, i spent
    the fourth with three stray children who were eating food and drinking beverages
    my friends brought for our picnic. 5. if your child asks to eat at my home or
    go somewhere with me, please have the courtesy to check with me to be sure an
    invitation was extended. yes, i heard your child yell across the street and ask
    if it was ok to eat at my house. and yes, i heard you say it was ok. however,
    i didn''t hear you ask me if i had invited her. well, guess what? i didn''t. my
    child didn''t either. so your child was sent home. 6. in my home, no one, child
    or adult, gets anything without a "please" and "thank you." that is, of course,
    common courtesy, but it doesn''t seem to be an important lesson in some homes.
    7. your children are welcome to play in my yard if everyone gets along, if there
    is no bad language or name-calling, and if you take a turn having them play in
    your yard. i have no grass in my yard now due to baseball games, and my flowerbeds
    are destroyed. and every child playing at my home has an excuse why they can''t
    play at their own house. 8. oh, yes -- don''t forget those slightly older children.
    parents, how about keeping an eye on them to make sure they aren''t bullying the
    younger kids? guess what, they are! they push them down, hit them, call them names
    and, by the way, their language is disgusting. so don''t get angry and call me
    when your child is sent home. you''ll get an earful you might not like. please
    don''t get me wrong, abby. i like children. i want my children to have friends
    over and enjoy themselves. and we have some wonderful neighbors for whom we''d
    do almost anything. i am, however, appalled at the lack of respect on the part
    of so many parents and children in our neighborhood. sorry this is so long, but
    i needed to address this issue since others have relayed the same kind of stories
    to me. oh, and by the way -- dog owners, just because i have a dog doesn''t mean
    it''s ok if yours soils my yard. but that''s another letter ... not everyone''s

    this is the first time i have ever sat down and written to you, although i often
    wonder what your thoughts would be on various matters. i have a good friend named
    "don." don''s wife, "susan," is the problem. every time we get together, she tries
    to impress people and acts superior. she does it in subtle ways, but my wife always
    ends up feeling somehow inadequate when the evening is over. susan talks a lot
    about money and has hinted to her parents about "early inheritance" many times.
    for the most part, she will associate only with people who are at least as well
    off as she is. and when she meets people who are wealthy, she sticks to them like
    glue. don and susan are having serious marital problems. i have seen her in action.
    she has a terrible temper and has been known to throw a phone or two. also, she''s
    the most shallow person i''ve ever met. how does someone get like this? my wife
    has told me that she can no longer stomach susan. i understand her objections
    to susan''s value system, but i fear if we refuse their invitations, don will
    be hurt. some of our other friends stopped seeing them years ago. i know don would
    be puzzled if i started inviting him alone. my wife thinks i should level with

    what is a guest supposed to do when entering another person''s car or home when
    the radio or television is playing so loud one can hardly talk or listen? i have
    found on many occasions upon entering the home of a friend or relative, the television
    is blaring. the host makes no effort to turn it down, even to welcome a visitor
    into the house. the tv has priority in so many cases. or when entering someone''s
    car, the radio is so loud, again one cannot carry on a conversation. i realize
    i am the "guest" in these instances, but aren''t there some rules of etiquette
    in this situation? at times like these, i feel the host would rather not talk
    with me even when i have been invited, and would prefer to listen to the radio
    or watch television. if this is true, why was i invited? i feel this practice
    is very rude. possibly the host has no idea that i''m not interested in visiting
    with the radio or television on. on only one occasion have i had the nerve to
    ask the host to turn down the volume. i felt very uncomfortable doing it, but
    my wish was granted. i did not feel i should have been put in that position. please

    yelling and calling him names over trivial things. she is a perfectionist, so
    anything not perfect is cause for a verbal assault. a recent example is a misplaced
    39-cent notepad. my son was called an idiot, stupid and an ass in her tirade.
    i feel this cannot be good for his emotional well-being, but i am unable to stop
    her. she becomes irate when i even suggest that she is less than a good mother.
    she does not do this in public, but i still think it is hurtful to my son''s self-esteem.
    she does the same sort of thing with me, but i''ve had counseling to deal with
    it. what can i do for my son? -- concerned dad in batavia, ill.'

    my fiance and i will be getting married in july, after an 18-month engagement.
    we have worked very hard on our wedding plans to make sure our special day is
    as perfect as possible. throughout our engagement, my future mother-in-law has
    been nothing but trouble. there have been many problems, but one has been especially
    upsetting. early on, my future mother-in-law talked about giving me a big family
    bridal shower. i thought this was fine. as the months went by, the shower date
    kept changing. now she says she wants to have a combination baby shower for her
    daughter, my future sister-in-law, and bridal shower for me, six days before our
    wedding. am i selfish because i want a separate bridal shower? i plan on getting
    married only once, and want everything to be "special." how can i explain to my
    future mother-in-law that i would rather not have a bridal shower at all than
    to share it with someone who should have a shower of her own also? -- hurt in

    recently here in the santa rosa area, a police officer shot and killed a man who
    was behaving in an irrational manner. he was advancing toward the officer with
    a wooden bar in his hand. a few weeks ago, a man was killed at a service station
    because he attacked a police officer with a screwdriver. abby, i think i have
    a way for the police to protect themselves without killing anybody if they feel
    threatened. i have always enjoyed "mutual of omaha''s wild kingdom." when they
    have shown episodes where they were checking on the health of a potentially dangerous
    creature such as an elephant, rhino, etc., they shot the creature with a tranquilizer
    before approaching it! it seems to me that having a tranquilizer gun in his hand
    instead of a .357-caliber magnum would give the police the means to gain control
    of an incident, and allow everyone to go home to their families without being
    in a coffin. why can''t the police use a tranquilizer gun in cases where they
    feel threatened? -- wayne in santa rosa, calif.'

    after reading the letter from "stuck in oklahoma," i felt compelled to write.
    "stuck" stated that her mother had died and her father''s second wife was difficult

    of someone who likes her: "stuck''s" father! the relationship with my two grown
    daughters was strained for years after i remarried. they slighted my wife, and
    indirectly me -- in many subtle ways. they would "forget" her birthday, and address
    special-occasion cards to me only, or behave rudely in her presence. any intervention
    by me was met with protestations of innocence on their part. after the loss of
    my second wife, i had a belated father/daughters talk and told them their behavior
    had been inexcusable. my second wife had never tried to replace my daughters''

    they aren''t interested, and we would tell them to have a nice evening. we don''t
    force anyone to talk to us. also, because the computer picks the phone numbers,
    we don''t know who we''re calling. we call a lot of businesses, but the majority
    of them don''t answer the phones correctly. they say "hello," with no indication
    that it is a business. then they get upset when we say we work for a research
    firm -- as though we''ve imposed upon them. if they would answer their phone with
    the name of their business, we would apologize and tell them we''ve reached the

    me, you cannot always tell by the name. i remember with amused embarrassment the
    first time an infant named jamie was brought to my office. at that time, jamie
    was a common name for a boy. i referred to the baby as "he," and mom quickly corrected
    me with, "she''s a girl." thank goodness mom didn''t hold my error against me.
    i have remained friends with the parents of this girl over the years. current

    two patients named robin -- one girl, one boy. if i''m told the name is "alex,"
    i still have to find out if it''s alexander, alexandra or alexis. and when mom
    says her baby''s name is "tony" (tony and toni sound the same), i don''t immediately

    baptist and therefore not sure of all catholic beliefs. i have queried many catholics
    and priests, and no one can give me a straight answer to this question. i called
    a local catholic church one day and posed this question: "when one of your parishioners
    makes a confession to you, you never reveal what was said in that confessional,
    do you?" the priest said, "absolutely not." i asked: "what would you do in this
    case? john jones is scheduled to die in the electric chair within a week for a
    murder he swears he never committed. the previous sunday, one of your parishioners
    says in his confession to you that he committed the murder. he gives you every
    detail, and you are convinced that he is the real murderer. would you turn him
    in to the police and violate the sanctity of the confessional, or would you not
    turn him in and let an innocent man go to the electric chair?" his answer was,
    "i would try to persuade my parishioner to confess to the police." i said: "supposing
    persuasion doesn''t work? in other words, your parishioner wants to get the murder
    off his conscience, but he doesn''t want to confess to the police and go to the
    chair." the priest said, "well, the best i can tell you is that i would use persuasion."
    then he hung up on me. my question is this, abby: what is the official position
    of the roman catholic church on this matter? does the church violate the sanctity
    of the confessional, or would it let an innocent man die for a murder he didn''t
    commit? you may use my name. -- john w. letzgus, palm bay, fla.'

    i am a 15-year-old virgin attending high school. lately there has been lot of
    controversy about handing out condoms in our school. as an educated teen-ager,
    i would like to tell all of the adults who are trying to terminate the distribution
    that they need to go outside their fantasy worlds and realize that many teen-agers
    are having unprotected sex because of the lack of availability of contraceptives
    and condoms. the risks of unprotected sex are no longer short-lived, but can have
    lifelong effects and, in some cases, can be terminal. it is ignorant to believe
    that if we tell people not to do something they will always listen. education
    is the key to awareness, but when education fails, some form of protection must
    be available. the comparison heard on the popular television series "beverly hills,

    many times i read letters in your column from people complaining about what some
    "insensitive" person said to them in the market, etc., about their adoption, their
    disability, hair, size, color, cars, or anything else noticeable. most recently,
    it was about the number of children (too many) a woman had. you know what that
    is called? making conversation. when people are standing next to each other in
    a long line, they often feel like reaching out to make a connection, like in the
    old days when people looked one another in the eye when they passed on the street.
    how are you supposed to start a conversation when you don''t know anything about
    the other person? you look for signs to latch onto. read any book about starting
    conversations, and you''ll find that''s how they get started. why not take the
    opportunity to welcome their reaching out, and if there is a real problem, gently
    correct them? most individuals do not start conversations with the intention of
    being rude or insulting. the reality is you do have more kids or longer hair,
    or are taller than average or whatever else it is they are "insulting" you about.
    their pointing it out is not what made it so. remember, you can catch more flies
    with honey than you can with vinegar. if you respond with something positive,
    and guide the conversation from there, "doing time" in line can become a few moments
    of pleasant connection with a fellow human being. who among us have lives so full

    we have been happily married for 17 years. i am 41 and and my wife is 36. we have
    three fine children, ages 12, 10 and 6. i do well financially. my wife never went
    to college and regretted it. i supported her effort in going back to school, so
    she enrolled. then her mother, who lives 400 miles away, became seriously ill
    with lung cancer. seven months ago, my wife quit school and went to stay with
    her mother. she is the only child in the family who was able to spend this kind
    of time with her mother. she keeps in touch and comes home when she can. it has
    been hard for her and hard for us. in recent weeks, her mother has improved enough
    to come here with my wife to visit. her mother also has home health care, so my
    wife could come home and proceed with her own life. however, she is having a hard
    time leaving her mother now. i would like to tell my wife that she has helped
    her mother as much as she can, but we also need her. my wife tells me she has
    been spending a lot of time going out to bars, dancing and partying with friends
    she has made in that town. she is very open with me and has told me some men are
    obviously attracted to her and have sent her flowers. she accepted the flowers
    and the attention, but said she would go no further. our sex life has not been
    very good in recent years, but she says she loves me and respects me more than
    anyone she has ever known. this barhopping bothers me because i love her very
    much and i''m afraid that something will happen sooner or later. she stays out
    until 2 a.m. and has never told these men she doesn''t want any further relationship,
    so it seems to me that she is leading them on. do you have any thoughts about
    her relationship with her mother? and what do you think about these nights out
    with her friends? -- frustrated in kentucky'

    last night my husband asked me if i had noticed that whenever we go out for dinner,
    the server never asks him what he would like to eat. instead, she turns to me
    and asks, "and what will he have?" abby, my husband has parkinson''s disease and
    his head now wobbles, his hands shake and he drags his foot a little, but there
    is nothing wrong with his mind. his hearing is excellent, he understands what
    people say, and he is not deaf, dumb or stupid. when i am asked, "and what will
    he have?" i always say, "i don''t know. why don''t you ask him?" abby, i''m constantly
    amazed at how stigmatized handicapped people are. my husband has a quick wit,
    a great sense of humor and is a kind, generous man. nobody is perfect. we all
    have some kind of disability. his hands may shake, but he can still put his arms
    around me, hold me and tell me how he loves me. i doubt this will do any good,
    but i just had to get it off my chest. just because a person has a physical disability
    doesn''t make him less a person. actually, he is more of a person because he''s
    had to cope with so many difficult things in life -- including stupid, insensitive
    people. thanks, abby. -- harriet r. in taunton, mass.'

    to help me work through this. i will start the process of finding one today. my

    bisexual activity if i just give him another chance. even if he could -- and that''s

    because prejudice and discrimination are so hurtful, i think we should do away

    prom? the poor, the frugal, the shy, the unpopular, the plain and the dateless
    are excluded. many parents cannot afford all that is involved in this rite of
    passage: formal wear, corsages, limousines. the kid who is saving his cash for
    college, the student who has no "significant other," is a reject on the eve of
    what should be a joyous camaraderie including all members of the senior class.
    instead, this occasion has too often turned into a boisterous bash with overnight
    parties, drugs, drunk driving and death. the above combination has made a farce
    of what was once a sensible, meaningful event. one father hired a horse-drawn
    carriage to transport his daughter to the prom! i''m ready for a lot of flak in

    who says what''s "right" when a woman wants to have a formal second wedding? my

    party started out to be six, including the bride and groom. it has now been reduced
    to four. we will all be dressed in gowns and tuxedos. this is the late ''90s,

    with a second formal wedding as long as it''s the first for the groom, and i agree.
    if it''s the bride''s first wedding and the groom''s second, no one would comment.
    but when it''s the bride''s second and the groom''s first, why must it be small
    and informal? shouldn''t it be up to the bride and groom, rather than anyone else?
    my sister''s wedding will be small, with a few friends and the immediate family,

    first dance, dollar dance, photographs, father-daughter dance, etc. what are your

    a panty girdle to help me look a little trimmer. i had been trying to lose 15
    or so pounds for almost a year without any success. my wife searched for a support
    garment designed for men and couldn''t find anything, so she finally purchased
    a long-leg panty girdle with a high waist. i was reluctant at first, but eventually
    tried it on. it made a remarkable difference, holding in my potbelly and smoothing
    my love handles. i now wear a panty girdle virtually every day and own several
    different brands. my wife is very helpful when i need to buy a new one. we both
    agree that it greatly improves my appearance. so why do i have to worry so much
    that someone will discover my secret? why is it ok for an overweight woman to
    wear something under her clothes to look trimmer, but for a man, it is weird?
    i am not gay, and neither am i a cross-dresser, but i do wear what is considered
    a woman''s undergarment. either the manufacturers should start marketing a man''s

    take them in the car when they go out, and make them languish in lonely backyards?

    in the midwest put a quarter in the parking meter of a total stranger. she was
    arrested for violating her town''s parking laws. a store owner on eastern long
    island put a sign in his window advertising the sale of pumpkins grown in his
    garden. he was arrested for violating some obscure zoning ordinance, and since
    his case has generated publicity, police and local officials have engaged in a
    campaign of harassment against him. a public-spirited chicago man who purchased
    an electric car to fight pollution is now engaged in a legal battle against the

    the letter in your column from "lady carpenter" inspired this letter. i do a little
    carpentry, too, but primarily i am an electrician. i have my own business and
    i, too, make frequent trips to hardware stores and lumberyards. i, too, bring
    my husband along to help carry and load. and yes, you guessed it, i''m also subjected
    to the ignorance of male clerks -- and sometimes female clerks, as well. my husband
    is wonderful. he either ignores the clerk who talks to him first, forcing the
    clerk to address me, or else he tells the person to talk to me because i''m the
    electrician and the buying customer. the only way i can get a clerk to look me
    in the eye instead of my husband is to go to the store alone. unfortunately, it
    takes longer to get waited on that way. i once had to track down the owner of
    a small local hardware store and ask if he was ever going to wait on me. he said
    he thought i had come in with the last man, who had just left. he apologized and
    then said he didn''t have anything in his store that would interest a woman. "how
    about if the woman is an electrician?" i asked. he said, "oh! what would you like?"
    i said, "nothing from you," and left. abby, we need to let more men know that
    there are plenty of women out here who are interested in so-called "men''s work,"
    and who are quite good at it, too. i''ve been "messing around" with wires since
    i was 10 -- more than 40 years now. please help us get the word out that women
    in the trades exist in greater numbers than most people realize. if you print
    this, please don''t use my name. let all those guys out there wonder which of
    the many thousands of us women who do "men''s work" wrote this. -- lady electrician'

    i just finished reading the letter from "hurting in cincinnati," and i think you
    missed the boat in your reply. nosy questions like "how much do you weigh?" don''t
    deserve answers. the flight attendant should simply flash her brightest smile
    and say, "wow! that''s really a personal question!" then change the subject entirely,
    i.e.: "would you like a magazine?" questions such as, "when are you due?" and
    "how much longer do you have before you go on maternity leave?" can be answered
    with humor by replying, "probably nine months after we decide to start a family!"
    with a smile and a chuckle. she can then ask the passenger, "do you have children?"
    and change the subject. as a woman who is overweight and has a sensitive nature,
    i have had to deal with my share of these questions. a smile and a sense of humor
    have helped me through most of them. "hurting in cincinnati" should remember that
    everyone has problems. some are just more visible than others. abby, people with
    a weight problem know they should see a physician. they know they should consider
    an exercise program and see a dietitian. but knowledge and action are two different
    things. ask any smoker, drug user, alcoholic or gambler. bribing us, shaming us,
    taunting us and humiliating us will not work. when we''re truly ready to seek

    three years ago, "donna," our youngest daughter, married "bill." we were not happy

    wedding and kept quiet. while they were dating, bill broke dates, was very late
    and sometimes didn''t show up at all. he hated all her friends, so eventually
    she gave them up -- even her longtime girlfriends. now he wants to have nothing
    to do with us. we live 1,000 miles away and feel lucky to get to see her twice
    a year (christmas and her birthday). we had a family reunion -- donna did not
    attend. bill''s family had a reunion -- they attended. i know donna should be
    more aggressive, but it is not her nature. should we stop calling, writing and
    sending her gifts? if we don''t stay in touch, it will be exactly what bill wants

    i have never written to you before, but i had to write immediately when i read
    your answer to "mourning in fresno," whose 25-year-old son had died. she wondered
    what to say when people asked her how many children she had, and you suggested
    she count only the living one. if "mourning" had lost her only child, would your
    answer have been the same? for her to say, "i have no children" would not only
    deny her son''s life, it would also deny what she had been for half of her life
    -- a mother to that child. a bereaved parent would feel guilty and disloyal failing
    to count the child who has died. "mourning" would probably feel better if she
    replied, "i raised two sons." then she could add a few remarks about her living
    son, steering the conversation in that direction. eventually, she will feel more
    comfortable talking about the son who has died. in the two years since our daughter''s
    death, the wonderful people at the compassionate friends have helped us to face
    this question and many others. i hope "mourning" can find a chapter of this support
    group in her area. -- sandee mcalpine, cincinnati'

    i am almost 18 years old and have been afflicted with stuttering most of my life.
    it hurts when i see people''s ignorance of stuttering reflected through discomfort
    or ridicule. those who are unfamiliar with stuttering often think it consists
    only of initial sound repetitions like "c-c-c-can you help me?" however, stuttering
    also consists of "blocks" such as getting stuck and becoming unable to utter a
    particular sound. this block can last varying amounts of time. a common misconception
    is that stuttering is associated with fear and anxiety. it''s true that these
    factors can increase stuttering, but it''s uncertain what actually causes it.
    believe it or not, many notable personalities have stuttered, including marilyn
    monroe, james earl jones, bo jackson, and even the great winston churchill. in
    1993, i discovered a group called the national stuttering project. it is one of
    the greatest things that have happened to me as a person who stutters. the group
    publishes monthly newsletters, has 79 local support groups in the united states,
    and holds a large convention every summer. if some of your readers stutter or
    know someone who does, or are simply interested in learning more about stuttering,
    they should write to the national stuttering project, 5100 e. la palma ave., suite

    may i add to your examples of acts of kindness? a short time later, a nurse from
    the hospital to which cindy had been transferred called to update me on her status.
    her injuries were severe; she was stable but critical and heading into surgery.
    breaking all the rules, the nurse told me that my nephews, jacob and travis, had
    died instantly in the crash. i had called ahead to houston to reserve a rental
    car. but when i arrived, they refused to rent me one because i didn''t have a
    current driver''s license. my purse had been stolen the week before, and i had
    not yet gone to get a replacement. all i had with me was an expired card i was
    using for picture id, but was told that was unacceptable. i was devastated. i
    was still two hours from the hospital where cindy was. i stood outside the rental
    office in the rain, ready to burst into tears, when two men who had been ahead
    of me in line at the counter approached and asked me why the agency wouldn''t
    rent me a car. i explained about my sister, her family, the stolen purse and the
    missing driver''s license. they listened sympathetically, then told me not to
    worry, they would get me there. they were john and june james, a father and son
    who live in houston. they took me to john''s home so i could call my family and
    let them know i was all right. then june drove me 120 miles (one way) to the hospital
    where my sister and surviving nephew were. i don''t know how i could have gotten
    to her side without their help. june''s sister rode along, talking with me and
    keeping me calm the whole trip. june drove 240 miles, round trip, for a stranger
    -- and i pray that god blesses them for their generous and caring natures. i don''t
    judge people by their color, but i know many ignorant people who do. thankfully,
    the james family doesn''t either, for you see, i am white and the jameses are
    black. they saw a person in desperate need, and i saw a loving family. my sister
    and nephew are still recovering from their injuries. her husband sustained minor
    injuries, but like cindy, he''s dealing with the grief of losing two sons. --

    i wonder if it would be too much to ask to have salespeople and other businesspeople

    who can''t see have the white-tipped canes, so why not something for those of
    us who have difficulty hearing? i have gone the route of hearing aids, but all
    they do is amplify the sound. they do nothing to clarify it. many large businesses
    like sears, j.c. penney, etc. employ young girls with accents who speak in very
    high-pitched tones that are impossible to hear, and they usually get angry if
    you ask them to repeat themselves. it''s just a thought, but if someone could
    think of a universal signal to let people know they have trouble hearing, a great

    when i saw the letter in your column from the woman who wrote to say that after
    13 years of abuse, she had finally decided she was going to leave her husband,
    i had to write. the woman''s decision prompted her to pen a poem she titled "love
    isn''t ..." after reading it, i was compelled to write my own "poem." i call it,
    "stupid is ..." stupid is ... -- staying married to a man who is physically and
    verbally abusive for 13 years! for heaven''s sake, get a clue! -- having a child
    with an abusive mate. it''s hard to believe there were no incidents of this nature
    prior to having a baby. -- raising a child in this hostile environment. statistics
    show that most abusers were either abused themselves or witnessed abuse during
    their own childhood. so, congratulations! you are now raising tomorrow''s crop
    of tormentors. -- any woman who doesn''t get the best possible education she can
    before she gets married or has children. a good education is your ticket to freedom!
    i''ve rarely heard a well-educated woman say, "i had to stay with this abusive
    man because i don''t have anywhere to go." -- any woman who would plan to have
    a baby with someone who hasn''t proven himself to be as committed to raising the
    child as she is. choosing to bring a child into the world simply because you "want
    a baby" is the height of selfishness. forget what you want. think of what is best
    for the child. -- anyone who would have a baby they cannot afford to care for.
    to people who complain that it''s impossible to raise a "family" on a minimum
    wage, i say, "if you are making only minimum wage, why are you starting a family?"
    work your way up the ladder. go back to school nights and weekends. many of us
    have done just that, and that is how we have gotten ahead. besides, job experience
    gives you something to fall back on if "mr. wonderful" turns out be less than
    you''d hoped for. you''ll know you are capable of taking care of yourself. abby,
    i''m sure i''ll be criticized for my opinion, but i am ... sick and tired of voluntary

    i am a mortgage broker, and it is my job to review people''s credit history. i
    am disturbed by the number of people who are mired in credit card debt. i just
    talked to a couple with four children who had more than $100,000 in credit card
    debt with an annual salary of $75,000. this is an extreme case. however, it is
    not uncommon for people to be caught up in the vicious cycle of paying for things
    on credit and being able to afford only the minimum monthly payments of these
    cards. i feel the credit card companies are to blame for all their gimmicks of
    "preapproved" junk mail, and the consumer is to blame for not being able to throw
    this mail away instead of signing up. credit cards encourage people to live beyond
    their means, creating financial stress in families. if people are in that situation,
    i encourage them to call the credit card company to close their account and cut
    up their cards, except one with a low interest rate or one that is due monthly.
    if there isn''t enough cash to pay for it -- don''t buy it! use the card for emergencies
    only. even though they may have to do without the new outfit or the larger television
    set, consumers will be happier without the stress that credit card debt can cause.
    are there support groups available for "credit junkies"? -- free and clear in
    florida'

    "loving daughter in lakeland, fla." wrote that her father had a college ring he
    never removed, but at his death she took the ring off to keep in his memory. she
    asked, "did we do the right thing?" your reply, "yes, without a doubt." you were
    wrong. my late wife never wanted her wedding ring removed. when she underwent
    serious surgery, she said, "don''t let them take the ring off." as death neared,
    she was concerned that the funeral directors might do so. when the time came to
    close the coffin, i leaned down for one last kiss, placed my hand over her cold
    one, touched the ring and said, "you got your wish. that ring never left your
    finger since i put it on, years ago." the body disintegrates after death, but
    gold is eternal. as long as our civilization survives, in that grave will be a
    circle of gold, memorializing a love that once existed. "loving daughter''s" father
    must have had a similar bond to his college. the ring should have remained with
    him throughout eternity. -- alone with memories'

    last christmas i was blessed with a visit from my daughter and her family. when
    it came time for them to leave, however, my granddaughter cried her heart out.
    we couldn''t get the tears to stop until i said, "let''s ask mom if you can spend
    part of the summer with me." my daughter agreed, but now i am faced with a problem.
    the trip entails two or three changes of airplanes. when i discussed my concern
    with a friend, she told me that her granddaughter had made a plane trip requiring
    two airplane changes each way. in order to ensure her safety, my friend gave the
    flight attendant $40 ($20 for each plane the child was taking). this was done
    for the return trip also. i was surprised that she had tipped the flight staff,
    but she assured me that this is what is done today. is tipping a requirement to
    guarantee the safety of a child flying alone, or do the airlines still provide
    personal attention for children without handing gratuities to the flight staff?

    i am an extremely pampered pet who was deeply offended by the letter written by
    "dogged out in south carolina," who wondered how to deal with people who treat
    their pets as members of the family. please remind her that pets are members of
    the family. according to the dictionary, a pet is "an animal kept for amusement
    or companionship," or "a person especially loved or indulged." i am sure i speak
    for all pets when i say that we prefer the second definition. perhaps "dogged
    out" should treat the animals she describes as she would other people. would she
    allow another person to lick her child''s face? absolutely not! would she permit
    a fellow human to push his nose into her dinner plate? i think not. i''m sure
    she would not hesitate to ask someone not to use a particular piece of furniture.
    so why should she not make her feelings known to us? tell us what you want, lady
    -- while we are incredibly intelligent, we''re not psychic. my family is wonderful.
    i have a busy social calendar, plenty of good food, a warm bed (i sleep with the
    family, under the covers with my head on a pillow, thank you very much), and lots
    of love and affection. in return, i show them unconditional love and devotion.
    i provide them with comfort in times of need, keep them amused (they really seem
    to enjoy tossing my toys and having me retrieve them -- go figure), and make them
    proud with my charming antics and natural beauty. how many humans give each other
    that kind of devotion? my advice to "dogged out" is to treat us like the companions
    we are. we''ll all get along much better that way. -- chloe, a new jersey pampered
    pet p.s. while i am extremely literate, my owner had to type this for me, as my
    paws do not reach the keyboard.'

    my wife and i are retired senior citizens. we occasionally like to take short
    trips, and we don''t have to answer to anyone or worry about anything when we
    leave home. on our recent anniversary (45th), our daughter and her family gave
    us a housebroken poodle, which they had purchased for themselves two months ago.
    (they live only two houses from us, so we knew about the dog and thought she was
    adorable.) when my daughter gave us the dog, i told her i absolutely did not want
    the responsibility. i was really upset and made myself quite clear. well, my wife,
    just to keep peace in the family, said that she would take care of the dog, so
    we kept her. and guess who is taking care of her? abby, was i wrong about the
    way i felt -- and still feel? my wife thinks that there wasn''t anything wrong
    with giving us this unexpected gift, but i am about ready to say, "it''s either
    the dog or me!" please tell me what you think about this, but do not use my name,

    although i have read your column for many years, i am not sure that this topic
    has ever been addressed. why are people so careless when opening their car doors?
    i don''t know how many times i''ve witnessed people carelessly opening their car
    door, only to let it slam into the car next to them. not only do they leave very
    noticeable dents on other people''s cars, i''m sure they can be damaging their
    own car doors. i have taught my two small children never to let the door hit the
    car next to ours. i''m hopeful this message will make people stop and think the
    next time they open their car doors. thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    the letter from "someone in georgia," the mother of a child who had died from
    an overdose of drugs, prompts this letter. she asked why no one had warned her
    about her child''s drug problem while he/she could be saved. perhaps this is the
    reason why: the mothers in our community have often discussed the necessity for
    openness and sharing information about each other''s kids. sadly, this commitment
    came crashing down on my family. my son (i''ll call him "mike") spoke to school
    counselors about his friend "john''s" drug experimentation, which he had both
    heard about and witnessed. mike wasn''t the first to reveal it to school staff.
    but he was the only one who agreed to tell john''s parents about it while in a
    protected school setting, in the presence of professional counseling staff. mike
    was sure that john''s parents would believe him and appreciate his honesty if
    they heard it straight from him. my husband and i naively agreed. the response
    was devastating. john''s parents called mike a "traitor," a "narc," and many names
    that are unprintable. john has predictably denied everything. his parents cried
    "conspiracy, competition, vindictiveness," and continue to claim that mike had
    ulterior motives. they blamed the accuser and became aggressors instead of listeners,
    criticizing and questioning the motives of my entire family. is making mike the
    enemy and a scapegoat a twisted way to deflect attention away from their own son?
    i now regret that i didn''t tell mike, "you don''t tell on friends." but the knowledge
    had burdened him for months. i assumed that personal integrity, mutual respect
    and honest evaluation would prevail. but john''s parents have remained in vehement
    denial, fueled by their child''s accomplished lying. the school principal tells
    me that it can take from 20 to 30 incidents -- even up to 60 -- for some parents
    to look objectively at a child''s drug problem, and that the substance abuse is
    most likely still continuing or will return. this has been awful. our household
    is still reeling. we thought of john''s parents as friends, fair people. mike
    still feels threatened, and even i feel threatened. now i ask myself, if the situation
    had been reversed, would my husband and i have been any more objective? parents
    want to believe their children; we need to believe them. nobody wants to face
    the darker possibilities. no parent wants to think that perhaps their parenting
    skills or their family''s communication system has failed. "someone in georgia"
    stated that she would have listened. ideally that would have been true. but when
    someone tried to reach her, perhaps she was steadfastly believing something else.
