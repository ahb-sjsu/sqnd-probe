    my husband and i decided to go our separate ways and have filed for divorce. although
    i moved out, we agreed to keep prior engagements. one of them is a trip to europe
    to visit family and friends. when we talked about traveling together, my understanding
    was that it meant sitting next to each other in the car and on the plane. now

    i am the mother of two teenaged girls (13 and 15) and have been debating whether
    to tell them a secret about my past. when i was in high school, i made some poor
    decisions. i went to a party with people i viewed as friends, had too much to
    drink and the evening ended with my being raped by someone i thought i knew. i
    reported it to my parents and the police, but because i couldn''t remember big
    parts of the evening, i wasn''t considered credible and no one believed me --
    not even my parents. my grades dropped, my weight plummeted and the entire school
    knew and believed his side of the story. i internalized everything and became
    a shell of who i was before the incident. it was years before i forgave myself
    for making a horrible mistake. ultimately, i moved in with my grandmother several
    states away to finish high school, far away from my parents and the pain. would
    it be appropriate to share this story (or a redacted version) with my daughters

    i have been in two relationships. the first was with a girl a couple of years
    older than i am. we were together for several years before she cheated on me and
    dumped me. i was crushed. the next girl was a few years younger. she did the same
    thing after we were together a year. what am i doing wrong? fidelity is important
    to me, and they both knew it from the start. how can i avoid this in the future?
    i have never been a controlling person. i was always fine with my girlfriends
    going out with their friends without me if i couldn''t go for some reason. (that''s
    how they ended up meeting the other guys.) the people in lasting relationships
    i''ve seen watch each other like hawks, and never allow their significant other
    to be in the company of the opposite sex without them. is this normal? should
    i be like them? that seems controlling, but clearly, my "no boundaries" relationship
    style has backfired on me. -- cheated on in new york city'

    i am in a predicament. my therapist is great, but sometimes i think she shares
    too much. last time i went, she was running late. when i finally got into her
    office, she told me the previous patient was nonverbal and had painted her nails
    during the session. later in the session, she confided that years ago she had
    been date raped. abby, i am in counseling because my father raped me when i was
    15 (i am now 24). her sharing has me worried because i don''t want her telling
    others what i say or do during counseling. further, her story of the date rape
    scared me. she described a situation that is not uncommon for me to be in, and
    it caused something almost like a flashback in me. i think what she did was insensitive,
    to say the least. i have nobody else to ask, so what should i do? i''m getting
    counseling for free now due to my income, and it took months to get set up with
    a counselor. should i report her or accept that this was a mistake and say nothing?

    my 22-year-old son is going to visit his father and get his third tattoo. i don''t
    like it, but i can''t control my son. he''s an adult. his father is retired and
    lives on his wife''s pension. it is my understanding that they are wealthy. my
    concern is for our 14-year-old daughter. my ex thinks tattoos are cool, and when
    he talks to her via skype, he talks about the next tattoo he is going to get.
    i''m afraid that when she''s 18, he will take her to get a tattoo as a bonding
    experience. his life is far removed from my daughter''s. he is surrounded by actors,
    entertainers and artists. our child (hopefully) will have a rich, abundant life
    in an ordinary way. she is focused on her studies and does well in school because
    of her efforts. how can i impress upon my not-so-confident, shy child that getting
    a tattoo is not a good idea? -- mary in missouri'

    i''m worried about a close friend i have known for about 10 years. she''s well-educated,
    independent and family-oriented. she has been online dating for quite a while
    and continually meets guys who have criminal backgrounds. she dated one of them
    on the down low for two years because she was embarrassed by how he behaved in
    public. the most recent man served a 16-year prison sentence for being involved
    in a murder. she tells me she doesn''t see a future with any of them, but goes
    on multiple dates and defends them with, "he seems like a nice guy." in the next
    breath, she''ll claim to want a steady and meaningful relationship. i have voiced
    my concerns. i asked her what she''d say to me if the tables were turned, and
    her responses mimic the concern i show her. i suggested she try a different website
    or mode of meeting potential partners, but it hasn''t made a difference. i believe

    is it normal for men to sulk or get angry when they don''t get sex when they want
    it? i''ve been married to my husband for more than 30 years. i run several miles
    a day and, with all the work i do, i don''t always feel like having sex. lately,
    i have been under a lot of stress, so i haven''t been in the mood. the other night,
    he did his usual sulking. then, as he often does, he tossed about in bed, repeatedly
    and roughly, while we''re trying to sleep. the whole bed shook. another night,
    he stuck his elbow in my ribs to be sure he got my attention. sometimes he''ll
    grab my butt really hard while i''m trying to sleep -- in the middle of the night,
    mind you. i end up having sex with him so he leaves me alone and i can sleep.
    i have tried sleeping in another bed. but then he comes to that room and repeatedly
    kicks the mattress. if i lock the door, he kicks the door. so, i have sex with
    him so i can live in peace. do most men do this when they don''t get sex as often

    when my husband and i were dating, he told me that he''d had a consensual sexual
    relationship with his cousin, "irma." he said they were in their early 20s and
    very immature. they parted ways because they both knew it was wrong, and irma
    moved to another state. he told me so one day i wouldn''t be blindsided should
    we ever be married. well, we got married, and this cousin has kept her distance
    until recently. irma has now started to attend their family events. we live too
    far away to go, but i dread the day when we do and she''s there. should i act
    like i don''t know what went on before i was in the picture? nobody in his family
    knows this ever happened between them. i have told my husband it makes me very
    uncomfortable and that it almost seems she attends hoping to run into him. why
    else would she? i would be very ashamed of having done this and would continue

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i am a physician and the mother of four curious, intelligent, energetic boys.
    my primary job as a mom is to keep them healthy, love them and educate them. i
    grew up in a small, conservative, gun-friendly community. my grandfather was a
    hunter. my friends growing up all owned guns at young ages. many of them today
    own guns for hunting or because they are first responders. i don''t fear the gun.
    i fear the person who doesn''t respect its power enough to properly secure it.
    as parents, we have an obligation to ask parents where our child will be spending
    time: "do you have a gun in your home? yes? how is it stored?" what we should
    be doing is coaching each other how to ask politely without giving offense. what
    words do you use? i practiced asking because i think the subject is touchy, but
    it does get easier with practice. (it took me a long time to learn to do it well.)
    abby, please encourage your readers to think about it and share their experiences
    and best advice. over the years, i''ve developed a multitude of openings that
    allow me to go from funny to sincere quickly. the ultimate question, however,
    never varies: 1. "you know, i''m so sorry to be ''that'' mom, but since we don''t
    know each other well, i need to ask you about a safety issue. please understand
    that my question isn''t a judgment -- just something i need to ask. do you keep
    guns in your home, and if so, how do you secure them?" 2. "this may be me just
    being overprotective, but the news lately has me fearful, so i have to ask. do
    you keep guns in the house, and if so, how do you secure them?" 3. "i love how
    well our boys play together! it''s fun to see their energy have an outlet. but
    i have a question before their playdate at your house. it''s one that always makes
    me a little uncomfortable, so please forgive me if this seems forward. do you
    keep guns on the premises, and if so, how do you secure them?" this is simple
    information-gathering so i can make an informed decision for my kids. i write
    this because i want all parents to feel empowered to ask these questions, and
    because i know that my asking prompted at least two moms to re-evaluate and change
    the way they stored guns in their own homes. -- kemia sarraf, md, mph'

    i am a yale-trained pediatric nurse with a post-master''s as a psychiatric nurse
    practitioner. i respectfully ask that you retract your answer to "first-time mom
    in new jersey" (june 21). i''m concerned your response will encourage other mothers
    to buy into the incorrect assumption that it''s "impolite" to ask questions that
    ensure their child''s safety. you should have encouraged and empowered "first-time
    mom" to politely ask about the presence of weapons in the other parents'' homes,
    and if so, how they are stored. it''s important information for her to have. if
    she has every playdate at her house and refuses to go to another home because
    she''s afraid to ask about gun safety, eventually the other mothers will pick
    up on the fact that she doesn''t trust their child-rearing capabilities, but won''t
    know why. if these potential friends don''t have unsecured firearms, or if they
    do and they are properly and safely stored, your advice will prevent healthy,
    honest friendships from developing, which will socially isolate her. how will
    she ever ensure a break for herself by allowing and encouraging her child to socialize
    at another trusted mother''s home she knows to be safe? your advice will only
    isolate "first-time mom" further and put her and her toddler at great risk. --

    last year was my son''s first year in kindergarten. a child who was allergic to

    very cautious. they actually had a separate table in the cafeteria for children
    with allergies. what started to bother me was the fact that because one child
    had allergies, treats for the other 20 kids were prohibited -- birthday cakes,
    candies, cookies, anything with eggs, etc. this has continued into boy scouts.
    again, all the children have to go without because of this one child. what is
    appropriate? must all 20 kids accommodate one so he doesn''t feel left out, or
    does his mom start teaching her child that he has allergies and there are foods
    he can''t have? they aren''t going to make a college dorm free of peanut butter.
    shouldn''t he start to understand that now, or must everyone adapt to his strict
    diet to make him comfortable? i want to be able to make gingerbread houses during

    i recently graduated from college, and like a lot of fresh graduates, i had difficulty

    far better than anything i could have asked for. this position is much closer
    to my dream job than a simple entry-level one, and i am over-the-moon happy. the
    problem is my partner, "gavin." gavin graduated the semester before i did. he
    was in a different degree program, and he''s still without a job. he applies for
    dozens of jobs a day, gets at least one interview a week, and then, after they
    ask about his less-than-stellar gpa, he never hears from them again. he has become
    increasingly frustrated about his inability to find employment in his field, and
    recently has been projecting his frustration on our relationship. i want to be

    our son-in-law, "brody," has a very different lifestyle than ours and the one

    as possible, although i admit my husband has been better at it than i have. one
    thing that continues to bother us is that whenever we invite them out for dinner,
    brody will order the most expensive thing on the menu. he also has a couple of
    drinks, upgrades his salad and orders dessert. by the time he''s done, the cost
    of his meal is double that of everyone else''s. although we can afford it, we

    my husband and i went on a trip with his brother and his wife recently. three
    days into the trip, while we were having dinner at a restaurant, my sister-in-law
    yelled at me, "shut up! you talk too much!" i was stunned. then my husband said,
    "i agree with her." words cannot express how surprised and hurt i felt. i do sometimes
    talk a lot when i''m excited, but no one has ever said this to me, certainly not
    my husband. the next day i felt very angry, especially at my husband for siding
    with her against me in public. i asked him to please tell me when we are alone

    my fiancee and i had a party. a very good friend of mine came with her 4-year-old
    daughter, "emma." it grew late and my friend wanted to stay for a while, so we
    put emma in our bed to sleep (the guest room was unavailable). after going upstairs
    to get emma later in the evening, my friend came downstairs with emma and told
    us that the child had wet our bed. not wanting to make emma feel bad, we said
    it was no problem. my friend did not strip the bed, offer to wash the sheets,
    or anything. she hasn''t mentioned it since, and didn''t follow up to make sure
    we were able to get the urine out of our bedding and the mattress. i find this
    to be incredibly rude and inconsiderate, but at the same time, what''s done is

    my sister has three kids whom i love. however, she and her husband seem to need

    but they use sitters to watch two of them, while they take one to soccer practice
    or go to the grocery store, etc. i get annoyed because all this baby-sitting falls

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    would you please remind your readers about proper service dog etiquette? my service
    dog has given me a new lease on life, but going out in public with him can be
    a huge source of anxiety. if your readers see a service dog in public, they should
    remember: don''t pet the dog, or talk to it, and don''t allow children to "rush"
    the dog. this distracts the service dog from its important job and could put a
    handler in danger. please don''t question whether service dogs are or should be
    "allowed" somewhere. handlers need to shop, take public transport and go to restaurants
    just like everyone else. do not ask invasive personal questions about the handler''s
    health or abilities. i''m sure you wouldn''t want a stranger prying into your
    own medical history. and please don''t gush about how "lucky" someone is to have
    a service dog or how you wish you could have your pet with you. try mentally replacing
    the word "dog" with "wheelchair" or "oxygen tank" before you speak. service dogs
    are not pets. for a lot of people they are lifelines. many of us are happy to
    speak with you about our dogs or answer questions, but please remember we are
    also people with individual comfort levels and limits, and we just want to enjoy
    public spaces like everyone else. -- new lease on life'

    i am a 28-year-old female. i recently married the most amazing man in the whole

    cigarettes. he fantasizes about me smoking all day, every day. i don''t smoke.
    i did for nine years, but quit five years ago (before i met him). i hated smoking
    -- the smell, the waste of money, the example i was setting for my kids, the harm
    to my health and feeling out of breath. smoking has killed some of my relatives,
    and jeremy knows it. but every day he keeps begging me to start up again. he tells
    me he''d do anything in the world to turn me on, and doesn''t understand why i
    refuse to please him by smoking. he asks me to hold a cigarette, take pictures
    of myself smoking it and send them to him. he wants to smell it on my breath.
    he''s literally obsessed. it really bothers me. i''ve bawled my eyes out in front
    of him telling him how much i don''t want to do it. he''ll feel bad and say he''ll
    stop, but starts back up again. i feel like it''s selfish that he wants me to
    put myself at risk to arouse him. he knows how i feel about every aspect of it.
    we have spent hours and hours talking this out. we plan on having a baby. i asked
    him how he''d feel if i smoked with his baby in my belly. he responded that i''d
    have to quit for the pregnancy. i feel this is going to ruin our marriage. what
    should i do? give in and start up with this horrible habit again to satisfy my

    my husband and i have been married for five years. he''s always been a jokester,
    which is ok, except for the way he does it. he knows what pushes my buttons, so
    his jokes are geared toward that. at first, i ignore it, but when he persists,
    i get mad. then he accuses me of overreacting and calls me unreasonable for getting
    mad because he''s "only joking." if a husband knows what pushes your buttons and
    makes you yell at him (which i never did before i met him), isn''t that playing
    with your emotions for his own entertainment? i''m not the only one he does this

    a phone call or message, and when i do, she doesn''t always respond. when we talk,
    i ask her about herself, and that seems to be the focus of conversation. or we
    talk about my baby. our relationship doesn''t feel genuine to me. i feel obligated
    to call her, but she doesn''t reciprocate. must i keep this up because we''re
    family, or should i tell her how i feel in the hope that our relationship could
    become a two-way street? she''s sensitive, and i''m worried that if i bring it
    up it will make things worse. -- struggling sister in massachusetts'

    i work as a runner in a law firm, which means i do pickups, make deliveries and
    do any other out-of-office tasks the lawyers or other staff need. part of my job
    involves picking up lunch for the office. sometimes the office manager will give
    me cash from the firm account to pay, other times the lawyers give me money out
    of their pockets to cover it. whenever i pick up and pay for these orders, the
    cashier/waiter is usually expecting a decent tip (especially when there are large
    orders). i am instructed to tip 10 percent -- no more. personally, i believe in
    being more generous because i know how poorly restaurant workers are paid. however,
    because the money is not mine, i must tip only what i am instructed to. sometimes,
    depending on the order, this results in a very poor tip. how can i let the cashier
    know that i would tip more if it were my money, but i can''t because it''s not?

    my husband and i have been married 10 years, and he treats my family and friends
    very different compared to how he treats his own. a few months ago, my sister
    called me at 9 p.m. she was driving through on her way to florida with her 7-year-old
    daughter and had been trying for an hour to find a hotel at that point. we were
    only 40 minutes away, so i told her she could stay the night with us. when i told
    my husband afterward, he flipped out because i didn''t ask his permission first.
    i have never invited anyone to stay with us before. my family lives far away,
    but i didn''t think it was a big deal to extend the invite because he constantly
    tells his family and friends they are always welcome. today he informed me his
    son is coming to stay a week with his wife and 6-month-old (two weeks from now!).

    i am a gay man who has been dating a divorced man for nine months. i''m 25 and
    he is 50. he was married to a woman for more than 20 years and has three children.

    never been apart since. it started great. we had a connection i had never experienced
    before i met him. he was let go from his job, and i supported him for some time.
    he finally found a job in georgia, and i am left in new york. i made plans to
    move there with him, but i''m nervous about it. first, because i have never been
    in love before and i''m not sure if he''s as in love with me as i am with him.
    second, he cheated on his wife with a man my age. the guy left him right before
    he met me, and i''m not so sure he is completely over him. (i know they are still

    and though we''ve lived 3,000 miles apart for most of our adult lives, we maintained
    a close friendship through phone calls and yearly visits. then ann got mad about
    something i said and stopped returning calls. finally, when i asked her what was
    wrong, she emailed me that our friendship "wasn''t working" for her and she "wished
    me well." around the time she stopped talking to me, she also cut ties with two
    other friends, and a couple of years later, stopped talking to her father. so
    this is a pattern with her. i have solid relationships with my husband, grown
    kids, co-workers and other friends. still, i can''t shake this sense of loss.

    recently, at a local doughnut shop, i created what i''m afraid was an awkward

    of mulling it over, i told them i was thankful for their service and politely
    asked, "may i please buy your coffee for you?" i was shocked when one of them
    responded, "i''d rather you didn''t. we make pretty good money, you know." he
    then proceeded to say he always tries to "avoid situations like this" because
    "a lot of service people take advantage of civilians who offer them things for
    free." the other two seemed to share his sentiments, but agreed to let me pay.
    each one shook my hand and thanked me before leaving, but i could see i had made

    he is different, but his dad is deep in denial, doing his best to force his son

    hangs out with and is most comfortable with girls. it has always been this way,

    is escalating and, while his dad remains in denial, his mom is telling michael

    way on the inside being on the receiving end of this kind of abuse every day.

    i am a 35-year-old woman who is returning to community college after a 10-year

    many times they show up 30 to 45 minutes late. (the classes are only an hour and
    15 minutes long.) also, some of them constantly talk during the lectures, forcing
    the teachers to talk over them. when i was in college the first time, teachers
    were allowed to deny a student entry to class if they arrived late and to kick
    students out if they were causing a disturbance. these students are robbing us

    when i was a young, newly divorced, single mother, i returned to college. there

    the friendship became more than platonic. this was my first experience with same-sex
    relationships, and i loved her deeply. we had six years together, but ultimately
    it didn''t work out and we moved on. i have been in a committed marriage all these
    years since. recently, her now-grown sons called me to "catch up." during the
    course of the conversation, they asked me if their mother and i had had an intimate
    relationship. i didn''t know what to say. my ex became very religious after our
    split and has never openly acknowledged (that i know of) the nature of our relationship.
    it''s certainly not my story to tell, but i didn''t know how to respond to her

    i am writing about how to proceed with expressing sympathy for an old friend.
    my husband and i were very close friends with a couple for about eight years.
    we moved away, but continued to see each other occasionally. we kept in touch,
    and in the past few years have been able to visit more frequently. when we were
    in their city six months ago, we saw them a few times and they mentioned that
    they had no friends. i know she has no siblings or parents left. her husband died
    suddenly of a stroke five months ago. they were together for 50 years. i sent
    her a formal sympathy note and three more casual follow-ups. i also wrote a poem
    in his memory. it may seem excessive, but i remember how bereft she felt when
    her sister died, and she felt that sympathy was not sufficiently extended (i don''t
    think she was pointing the finger at me). abby, i don''t want her to think that
    we aren''t feeling a lot of sympathy for her. yet her silence indicates that either
    our overtures are unwanted or that her condition is so bad that she''s emotionally

    six years ago, not long after i announced to my family that i was going to be

    i allowed him to walk me down the aisle, she didn''t attend my wedding. i was
    extremely hurt by it, but decided to forgive and forget. unfortunately, my mother
    could not do that. for the last six years, she has ignored my phone calls and
    text messages. i have sent cards and gifts for birthdays, christmas and mother''s
    day and received no acknowledgment (although she does generally send me a generic
    birthday or christmas card). we were very close before all this started, and i
    have tried reaching out to her in every way i know how. what makes this even more
    awkward is that she lives a stone''s throw away, and my teenage daughter is close
    with her. if i''m outside when she drops my daughter off, she hides her face or
    pulls up in front of a big tree in my yard so she can''t see me. cutting family
    out of her life is a pattern for her. my mother hasn''t spoken to her own father

    quite young, but we have sex only once or twice a month. our relationship is great,
    and we love each other. i just wish we had sex more often. i''ve told him i would
    like more, but it stays the same. when we talked about past relationships, he
    mentioned women hounding him to have sex, so i don''t think it''s me. i don''t
    want to cheat, but i''m afraid i eventually will if my needs are not met. i don''t
    want to leave him, but i don''t want an almost sexless marriage. he''s a very
    masculine man, so i don''t know how to ask him to go to the doctor to get something
    to increase his sex drive. should i do that? or should i get things to supplement
    our sex, like toys? -- needs more in florida'

    i just stumbled upon my daughter-in-law''s twitter account. she has posted half-naked
    pictures, talked about all the drinks she was consuming, and said that if she
    didn''t have a child, she''d be gone. the language she used would make a sailor
    blush. i baby-sit for her, and i was shocked, to say the least. i foolishly posted
    a shocked cat on facebook, stating that "this is me reading your twitter account."
    my son is now upset with me that i read her twitter posts. i am not sure he had
    seen them. i saved them on my computer, which he picked up when he was here and
    ran through my history. i know i didn''t handle this the right way, but she was
    saying she starts drinking at 7 a.m., and that "moonshine wasn''t working anymore."

    my 17-year-old son has always been very shy. i don''t think it helps that he''s
    now 6 feet 6 inches tall and obviously stands out. recently at a sports event
    which his team won, there were celebrations that were caught on video, and i could
    see him milling around outside of the "celebratory circle" of his teammates. it
    seemed very sad that he didn''t feel comfortable enough to jump into the huddle.
    when he was asked to join his teammates for lunch, he said he wasn''t hungry.
    he has known many of the kids on his team for more than six years and has hung
    out and been on sleepovers with some of them on many occasions, so it''s not like
    they are strangers. my husband thinks we should just let him find his own way
    in life. i desperately want to talk to him and see if i can''t get him to be more
    sociable, but i''m not sure how to achieve this. what would you suggest, abby?
    leave him alone or intervene, and if so, how? -- mother of a shy guy'

    i was married for more than 20 years. my ex and i divorced five years ago. during
    that time i stayed busy focusing on my children and their needs. about seven months
    ago i met a nice guy. we saw each other for about five months, then out of nowhere,
    he broke things off. i was devastated. he said his reason for the breakup was
    "he needed time to find himself." he was recently divorced and has sole custody
    of his kids. he has been under a great deal of stress and started seeing a therapist
    a couple of months ago. i understand why he needs this time, but i also wish he
    would let me help. he said he wants to remain friends. i avoided contact with
    him for several weeks, but now i am drawn back to him. my friends keep telling
    me to forget him, but i can''t get him off my mind. we talk almost daily and have
    even gotten together again a couple of times. i keep telling myself all the reasons
    it won''t work. should i run away, stay friends only, or hope to work things out?

    my boyfriend''s friend "keira" moved back here to help take care of his mom. he
    has known her for more than 10 years. they didn''t have an intimate relationship;
    it was more of a friendship than anything. he''s very loving toward me and treats
    me like gold. the problem i''ve been having is, he doesn''t understand how some
    things bother me. for instance, when the three of us went to dinner, they were
    sharing food by feeding each other. i''m sure people probably thought they were
    a couple. when i asked him why he didn''t put some food on a plate and give it
    to her, he didn''t have an answer. also, they watch tv in bed together. he thinks
    these are normal "friend things" to do. i''m not a jealous person, but i have
    my limits. we don''t live close, so we see each other only a few times a week.
    keira doesn''t pay anything to live there. he said she has nowhere to go, and
    it was his agreement with her that if she came home with him she would always
    have a place to stay. i like her, but sometimes feel like i''m dating both of
    them. he''s clueless. they are dependent on each other. she fixes things around
    the house, and he lets her borrow his car for work. am i just being petty? --

    in any way. some of them have -- or had -- pets at one time. a few did send cards
    or emails, and they were so appreciated. their kindness will never be forgotten.
    mandy wasn''t sickly. she just stopped eating one day. when we took her to the
    vet a few days after trying everything we could think of, the diagnosis was kidney
    cancer. a couple of days later we had to make the heartbreaking decision to put

    my 9-year-old daughter has several friends whom we love and who are good buddies
    for her. however, the rules in their homes are different from those at ours. one
    friend in particular, "sarah," eats a lot of junk food and watches more tv than
    we allow. when my daughter asks why she can''t have chips and ice cream after
    school, or why we watch movies only on weekends, i remind her that good food and
    exercise make her healthy, and with less tv she does better in school. i''m not
    interested in critiquing sarah or her family, who are lovely people we really
    like. however, i do want to make the connection between unhealthy lifestyle choices
    and possible consequences because this is a subject we''ll keep revisiting as
    my daughter grows up. i have been trying to say things like, "everyone makes their
    own decisions. this is why we do it this way," but at 9, my daughter sees things

    i have seen letters in your column from parents who want to ensure their children''s
    and teenagers'' safety when visiting their friends'' homes. a question parents
    need to ask the hosting parents is what their drug and alcohol policy is. we wrongly
    assumed (and trusted) that our daughter''s friends'' parents did not facilitate
    access to alcohol or drugs to minors. we realized -- too late -- that from the
    time she was 15, our daughter had access to unmonitored alcohol and was sometimes
    encouraged to consume it in these homes. many parents think it''s ok if teens
    drink alcohol under supervision, as long as the parents are there and they have
    possession of the car keys. they wrongly rationalize that the teens are going
    to do it anyway, so why not under supervision? what these good-time parents don''t
    consider is that a teen who may have a genetic predisposition to addiction may
    have just gotten a switch turned on in his or her developing brain. you can''t
    look at people and know if they are prone to addiction. in our case, our daughter''s
    addiction became a long, difficult struggle, which led to the untimely death of

    recently, while making a purchase at a local store and handing the cashier my
    money, she asked, "how many months along are you?" i was confused for a moment,
    until i realized she had assumed i was pregnant. (i''m not.) when i told her i
    wasn''t, she just shrugged and said, "oh." abby, my feelings were hurt. i will
    most likely never see that cashier again -- and i do not know her -- but i would
    like to know how to respond to this in the future. i don''t believe people should
    assume a woman is pregnant unless they know for sure that she is. what she said
    made me instantly want to lash out. however, i knew that responding with more
    rudeness would do no good. so, what should i say if this ever happens again? --

    my husband''s nephew, "jacob," is 25 and always hanging around our house. he has

    there when he needed advice about things. well, he recently broke up with his
    longtime girlfriend, and he''s here at my house every day -- even days he''s not
    working. he calls every afternoon to see what i''m cooking and expects to eat
    here every night. he also expects me to drop what i''m doing to go and clean his
    house and wash his clothes. i''m disabled, so it''s a struggle just to feed my
    husband and myself. he also sleeps here on the weekends if he doesn''t work. my
    husband and i no longer have any alone time because he''s always here. i have
    tried to tell jacob nicely that he needs his own life, but the message isn''t
    getting through. i know he has issues with being alone. he has never learned to
    be by himself. my husband is starting to get angry about the situation and wants
    me to "handle" it, but my words are not working. if my husband decides to say
    something, it will end up in a heated argument. how can i get through to this

    after i go to sleep (he is a night owl and i usually end up going to sleep first),

    empty cans out, he hides them. when i accidentally discovered his hiding place,

    check the same spot, and i have noticed that he has been hiding them again. a
    beer or two is ok with me, abby, considering the stresses he deals with at work.

    guy, and my wife knows it. when i bring up the subject of purchasing the car of
    my dreams, which is not very expensive, she tells me i will look like an idiot.
    in her next breath she says it''s ok if i buy a sports car if it is the one she
    wants, and of course, the one she wants is very expensive. no matter how i broach

    i have been with "roger" for 28 years. he is basically a good, honest man, but
    he thinks only of himself. when i had heart surgery, he left me alone at the hospital
    that night, not knowing if i would live or die. (nothing would have kept me from
    his bedside!) i''ll be having knee surgery soon, and he won''t take the day off
    or a sick day to take me. he wants a friend of ours to do it. these are just two
    samples of his lack of support for me. i guess there is no way to make someone
    care enough about you to put their conveniences aside. when we moved out of state,
    he said if he didn''t find a job, he was going back home. well, where would that

    and rotates roommates every two to three years. looking for a "mini commune" in
    a crowded city like san francisco is very difficult. what makes matters worse
    is that she also has hobbies like sewing that require a lot of space. is there
    something wrong with this lifestyle preference? and if so, how do i help her break
    out of it? -- worried dad in california'

    i bought my 11-year-old daughter a cellphone. my ex does not approve. we have
    been divorced for six years, and he still can''t get over it. he despises me.
    he refuses to listen to why i want her to have a cellphone. while i want her to
    be responsible with it, i realize she will make mistakes -- which she already
    has by being on her phone too much. (it has been taken away from her once.) i
    want her to carry the phone with her in case of emergencies. if it is confiscated
    at school, her dad will no doubt tell me, "i told you so." should i abide by his
    wishes and not allow her to have the phone, or do you think my points are valid?

    i have an unusual problem. i''m very accident-prone. over the past several years
    i have been in a cast many times, sometimes for long periods. my friends constantly
    tease me about it when what i''d really appreciate is a little compassion and

    i am a healthy, somewhat older lady with a reasonable appetite who unfortunately
    sleeps alone. consequently, i have a few toys to help me on sleepless nights.
    one of my biggest worries, however, is that if i should expire and my loved ones
    discover my toy collection after my demise, they will be shocked. i don''t want
    to give up my toys, but i am worried about what my loved ones will think of me
    should i cease to exist before my appetite decreases. surely one of these days
    it will. but in the meantime, what happens if i die and they discover my secret?

    i am a 58-year-old female. my mother passed away in my home almost exactly a year
    ago. i took care of her for the last three years of her life. after she died,
    my brother and his wife came to my home at 1:30 p.m. the funeral home didn''t
    arrive to pick her up until 8:30 that night. later that evening, after my mom
    was gone and my brother and his wife left, my daughter came to me and announced
    that my sister-in-law had secretly taken pictures of mom in the body bag on the
    stretcher as she was being wheeled out of my home. she didn''t know that my daughter
    had seen her. i am furious, horrified and hurt beyond description! my mother always
    liked to look nice and made a special effort to look good for a picture. the coroner
    had told me to go into another room when they were taking her because he said
    i wouldn''t want that as my last memory of her. i have never said anything to
    my sister-in-law, but i can''t seem to let this go. it''s killing me. am i overreacting?
    please, i need your advice. -- missing mom'

    my sister and her family recently moved out of state after having lived near our
    family all her life. mom and i want to visit her this year, but she likely won''t
    have enough room for us in the house because she has three kids and only three
    bedrooms. she does have a sofa bed and an air mattress, but neither my mother
    nor i want to sleep on them. both of us suffer from back and knee problems and
    don''t want to be uncomfortable. would it be rude if we stayed at a hotel? we
    have never stayed with her family before, so we''re not sure if they would be
    upset. what is the proper etiquette here? -- puzzled guest'

    lasted a month before he ended it without giving me a reason. i went on with my

    in my life. i was caught by surprise because i thought he had forgotten about
    me. i replied casually, and the conversation continues. he knows about my plans
    to work abroad. he says he supports them and would like to send money to help
    me start, but he wants to keep it a secret and asked me to promise not to tell
