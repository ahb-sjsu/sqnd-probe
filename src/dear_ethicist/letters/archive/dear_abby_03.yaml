    it’s that time of year again, and as a sales clerk of many years, i hear the same
    lament every year from young people: “what can i get mom, pops, aunt martha or
    uncle joe? they have everything they want already.” wrong! they don’t have what
    they really want. most would prefer a short visit, or an invitation to lunch or
    dinner, the chance to share a movie, a shopping trip. or just the pleasure of
    an auto ride. a little personal attention is what most people want and need. think
    about it. santa’s helper in ohio dear helper: ijust did—and you''re absolutely

    i''m writing this while waiting for my husband to finish shaving and join me for
    breakfast. about five minutes ago, i glanced out the window and saw 10 or 12 memeidtingjrom
    a large van. they were nicely dressed, all carried briefcases, and were obviously
    a crew of salesmen. within minutes my doorbell rang. i ignored it. my husband
    heard it and shouted, “will you please get the door!" i yelled back. "it’s some
    salesman; besides, i never answer the door unless i''m expecting someone.” he
    became very impatient with me and‘ said, “what’s the harm in answering the door
    and finding out what the salesman is selling?" i told him i felt no obligation
    to listen to strangers who want to sell me something. he insisted i could always
    say no. abby, this has happened several times in our 40-year marriage. i feel
    that this is my home and i don’t have to open my door to every person who pushes
    my doorbell. what is your opinion? j ane in greenville, texas dear jane: same

    please settle a family conflict. our son. a senior in college, was home for the
    summer, and for the first time he stayed out all night. he went out on a date
    and didn''t even call to let us know he wouldn''t be home to sleep—he just walked
    into the house the next afternoon without a word. after this happened, i asked
    him to please call us if he knows he will not be home to sleep. he ignored my
    request and continued to do the same thing frequently until the end of the summer.
    after he went back to college, he wrote us an angry letter saying he is an adult
    now and shouldn''t be bound by high school rules. he also said he is no longer
    a part of our household, he''s a "guest" and shouldn''t be expected to let us
    know if he''s going to stay out all night. my husband says i should calm down—our
    son is now 21. what does that mean? i really would like to know how you feel about
    this. abby. —chicago mother dear mother: i would argue that even though your son
    is 21, when he’s home, he''s still a part of your household. however, if he insists
    that he’s a ”guest,” remind him that as a matter of courtesy. a guest always informs
    his hosts in advance that he will not be home for the night—assuming he knows,

    i am writing out of concern for others who may have to go through what i have.
    i lost both my parents recently in an automobile accident. the shock was hard
    enough to deal with. but on top of that, i had to take care of all the funeral
    arrangements. my parents had never discussed the subject with me, and i had absolutely
    no idea where to start; what kind of arrangements to make or how i was going to
    pay for it. i am newly married and the oldest of their children. so the entire
    responsibility fell on me. having to handle all this while under so much emotional
    stress was traumatic. i still wonder if i made the right decisions. some good
    did come out of this. however. after it was over, my husband and i arranged our
    own funerals by making a prepaid contract with a local mortician. now we have
    the peace of mind of knowing that everything will be the way we want it, and that
    terrible chore will not fall on either one of us or our children. i hope you put

    die there. if you do. what happens to your contract? also, what happens to your
    contract if your mortician goes out of business. or sells it to another mortioian?
    at the risk of sounding like a broken record, i repeat: never sign any kind of
    contract without the approval of a lawyer. el'

    do you think grounding a 10-year-old boy for six weeks is a just punishment for
    getting cs on his report card? i could understand this kind of punishment for
    ds. but i always thought a c was a passing mark. the boy’s parents think he has
    the potential to do better because his sisters get a’s and be. what do you think?
    interested party dear interested: i don''t know whether the boy is working up
    to his potential or not. but i do know that children should never be compared
    with their siblings. praise and encouragement will do more for a 10-year-old than

    i am writing out of concern for others who may have to go through what i have.
    i lost both my parents recently in an automobile accident. the shock was hard
    enough to deal with. but on top of that, i had to take care of all the funeral
    arrangements. my parents had never discussed the subject with me. and i had absolutely
    no idea where to start, what kind of. arrangements to make or how i was going
    to pay for it. i am newly married and the oldest of their children. so the entire
    responsibility fell on me. having to handle all this while under so much emotional
    stress was traumatic. i still wonder if i made the right decisions. some good
    did come out of this, however. after it was over. my husband and i arranged our
    own funerals by making a prepaid contract with a local mortlcian. now we have
    the peace of mind of knowing that everything will be the way we want it, and that
    terrible chore will not fall on either one of us or our children. i hope you put
    this in your column. it might start people to thinking so they won''t continue
    to put off this unpleasant task. after all, death is natural and comes to all
    of us. j .t. in w. va. dear j.t.: you were very wise. i hope you were wise enough
    to have your "prepaid contract" examined by your attorney. although death is a
    fact of life. you have no guarantee that you will not move to another state and
    die there. if you do, what happens to your contract? also, what‘happens to your
    contract if your mortician goes out of business, or sells it to another mortioian?
    at the risk of sounding like a broken record, i repeat: never sign any kind of
    contract without the approval of a lawyer. el'

    i am upset and disgusted by a recent experience. i am the mother of three daughters,
    ages 4, 2 and 6 weeks. the youngest was just christened in the roman catholic
    church, as were her two sisters when they were 6 weeks old. all three wore the
    same christening dress. which was given to me by my husband''s sister (i’ll call
    her dee). dee herself had been christened in that dress, and i was thrilled and
    honored when she gave it to me for my first daughter’s christening. afterward.
    i carefully put it away. last week, after the christening of my third daughter,
    dee just plain took the dress off my bed and walked off with it! i am hurt to
    the core because all three of my daughters were christened in that dress and i
    was saving it for them to use for their children one day. if dee had told me she
    was only lending me that dress, my brothers and sisters who were the godparents
    to all my children would have bought me one. who is wrong. abby? heartbroken dear
    heartbroken: dee should not have repossessed the dress without informing you.
    and since she gave you the dress without making it clear that she wanted it back,
    you had every right to assume it was yours to keep. . i advise you to call your
    sister-in-law and address your questions to her. only she can answer them. reproduced

    many years ago you had a letter in your column from a little girl named virginia
    who wrote to say thather friends had told her there was no santa claus. your response
    captured the spirit of christmas so beautifully. i wish you would run it again.
    sunday school teacher. baltimore dear teacher: to set the record straight, the
    piece to which you refer is a famous, well-loved classic titled, “yes, virginia.
    there is a santa claus." it was written in 1897 by francis p. church, who was
    the editor of the now defunct new york sun, in response to this letter: “dear
    editor: "i am 8 y are old. “some my little friends say there is no santa claus.
    "papa says, ‘if you see it in the sun, it''s so.’ "please tell me the truth. is
    there a santa claus?" —virginia o’hanlon dear virginia: your little friends are
    wrong. they have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. they do not
    believe except what they see. they think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible
    by their little minds. all minds. virginia, whether they be men’s or children''s,
    are little. in this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect. an ant. in his
    intellect. as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the
    intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge. yes, virginia.
    there is a santa claus. he exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion
    eidst, and you know that they abound and glvelto your life its highest beauty
    and joy. alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no santa claus. it
    would be as dreary as if there were no yirglnias. there would be no childlike
    faith then. no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. we should
    have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. the eternal light with which childhood
    fills the world would be extingulshed. not believe in santa claus! you might as
    well not believe in fairies! you might''rﬁet your papa to hire men to watch in
    all the chimneys on christmas eve to catch santa claus, but even if they did not
    see santa claus coming down. what would that prove? nobody sees santa claus, but
    that is no sign that there is no santa claus. the most real things in the world
    are those that neither children nor men can see. did you ever see fairies dancing
    on the lawn? of course not. but that’s no proof that they are not there. nobody
    can conceive or imagine all the wonders that are unseen and unseeable in this
    world. _ you tear apart the baby''s rattle and see what makes the noise inside.
    but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor
    even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear
    apart. only faith. fancy, poetry. love, romance. can push aside that eurtain and
    view and picture the supernatural beauty and glory beyond. is it all real? ah,
    virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding. no santa claus!

    all my problems at once. i know i can do something for 12 hours that would appall
    me if i felt that i had to keep it up for a lifetime. j fist for today i will
    be happy. abraham lincoln said. "most folks are about as happy as they make up
    their minds to be." he was right. i will not dwell on thoughts that depress me.
    i will chase them out of my mind and replace them with happy thoughts. just for
    today i will adjust myself to what is. i will face reality. i will change those
    things that i can change and accept those things i cannot change. just for today
    i will improve my mind. i will not be a mental loafer. i will force myself ''
    to read something that requires effort, thought and concentration. just for today
    i will -do something positive to improve my health. if i''m a smoker, i’ll make

    i‘ll simply say. “i don''t know." j net for today i’ll do somethiﬁg i’ve been
    putting off for a long time. i’ll finally write that letter, make that phone call,
    clean that closet or straighten out those dresser dra wers. j not for today, before
    i speak i will ask myself, “is it true? is it kind?" and if the answer to either
    of those questions is negative, i won''t say it. just for today i will make a
    conscious effort to be agreeable. i will look as good as i can, dress becomingly,
    talk softly, act courteously and not interrupt when someone else is talking. just
    for today i''ll not improve anybociy except my_self. just for today i will have
    a p''rogram. i may not follow it exactly, but i will have it, thereby saving myself
    from two pests: hurry and indecision. just for today i will have a quiet half-hour
    to relax alone. during this time i will reflect on my behavior and will get a
    better perspective on my life. just for today i will be unafraid. i will gather
    the courage to do what is right and take the responsibility for my own actions.

    the lady in my life (i’ll call her wanda) is a 36—year old widow with one child—a
    16— year-old son. i''ll call him buddy. he''s a good kid, but his mother has spoiled
    him rotten. he talks to his friends on the telephone for two and sometimes three
    hours consecutively. wanda has to interrupt his conversation in order to use the
    phone—then he rushes her to get off so he can resume his conversation. i have
    given up trying to call because her line is always busy. wanda sees nothing wrong
    with this. she says she “loves" him, and the telephone is sort of a substitute
    father, so who am i to argue with her? right now she’s doing buddy''s homework
    while he’s playing a record for someone over the phone. i think something is terribly
    wrong here. what do you think? —wanda’s man dear man: i think wanda is setting
    buddy up to beill-equipped to handle life’s problems. children need to learn discipline,
    responsibility and consideration for others in order to become productive and
    self-sufficient. that’s love. letting buddy goof off while she does his homework
    is giving him a sadly distorted picture of the real world. for all wanda’s good
    intentions, buddy will be the big loser in the end. wanda needs to be wised up.

    if i don''t get this off my chest i think i will explode. don''t people think
    before they buy christmas presents to send to relatives? my dear brother was 78
    years old, terminal and in a nursing home. the family knew it--it was no secret.
    he had been there since oct. 1. well, one of his nieces sent him a jogging suit
    for christmas. abby, a jogging suit for a 78-year-old terminal patient? have you
    ever heard of anything so ridiculous? it was not a matter of mixing up the cards,
    because the card read, "happy jogging, (then his name)." he died the next day.
    this same idiot niece sent me a 10-quart kettle. i have no intention of opening
    a boarding house. i can''t imagine where she got the idea that i could use anything
    like that, as i am a widow and live alone in a small condo. i know it isn''t proper
    to look a gift horse in the mouth, but why in heaven''s name do people send such
    inappropriate gifts? if they haven''t the time to shop or the brains to select
    something useful, a gift certificate for even $10 would be so much more appreciated.
    thank you. i feel better now. disgusted in ontario.'

    i have had it! for the last six years my husband and i have had a cocktail party
    on christmas day for our neighbors and close friends. we have an open bar and
    a beautiful buffet, which is quite expensive. here''s my problem: one couple (man
    and wife) arrive early and gorge themselves at the buffet table. they eat so much
    and so fast, little is left for the other guests. honestly, abby, between them
    they polish off over half of a special meat dish that most guests have complimented
    me on. after they have sated themselves, the husband concentrates on our liquor.
    the other guests have noticed how piggish they are, and my husband said he has
    had these pigs at our parties for the last time. but how can we avoid having them?
    they are very close neighbors, and it would be awkward to exclude them. if we
    don''t invite them, they are brassy enough to come uninvited when they see all
    the neighbors going into our house. any suggestions? anguished in arizona.'

    i read with a great deal of amusement the letter from "bill wadley, kimberling
    city, mo." wherein he referred to bachelors as "two- legged jackasses." he also
    asked, "what do bachelors do besides avoid marriage and responsibility?" may i
    tell him? for one thing, they bear more than their fair share of the tax burden.
    although bachelors have no children, they''re heavily taxed to educate the children
    of married men. and their tax dollars go to support families who are on welfare.

    my husband and i are in our 70s and in poor health. ten years ago, our son borrowed
    $10,000 from us. he promised to repay it on a monthly basis (no interest) within
    three years. he needed it for his business. his business has been thriving. he
    and his wife have their own home and swimming pool; the two older children (in
    college) have their own cars, and his wife also has one. we have not received
    one penny of the $10,000. four years ago, this son literally walked out of our
    lives without one word of explanation. he lives two miles away. we have not had
    a telephone call, a card, a gift--nothing. this also applies to his wife and children.
    (the oldest is 21; the youngest is 11.) we know that they are well because we
    hear from others who see them and do business with our son. before christmas my
    husband said, "let''s accept the fact that they don''t want to be bothered with
    us, and stop sending them gifts. (until this year, we remembered them on all occasions,
    but they never acknowledged anything--just cashed the checks.) what do you say,

    all goes back to when nora first met scott. she fell head over heels in love with

    passes at me, which created some bad feelings between him and my fiance. i never
    told nora what kind of creep scott was, hoping she''d catch on and dump him. (she
    never did.) over the years our foursome kind of drifted, but i still consider
    nora one of my closest friends. how can i invite her to my wedding without letting
    her bring scott? (i wouldn''t want to go to a wedding without my fiance.) would
    it be tacky to invite her and tell her not to bring scott? she would wonder why,
    and i just couldn''t tell her about what happened four years ago. maybe he''s

    is a disgrace to our beautiful state. also, is "dot" really her name? or is it
    the size of her brain--or her heart, if she has one? i cannot believe the nerve
    of that woman. she said: "several months ago, our 59-year-old mother-in-law had
    to quit her job to stay home and care for our father-in-law, who had a massive
    stroke that left him totally helpless. they have six married sons and 11 grandchildren--the

    like that is a job for a daughter- in-law. we are also very busy with our own

    their parents with money, but we think mom should repay the favor by keeping our
    kids every weekend." i am so mad i could explode. each couple kicks in with a
    lousy $20 a month. abby, i pay a neighbor $20 a month to feed my dog when i go

    help in another area: recently i attended services in a small protestant church

    "would those who would like to rededicate their lives, please come forward and
    kneel at the altar?" as i looked around the church, i saw that about three-fourths
    of the congregation was over 55 years of age. as anyone involved in the health
    care field can tell you, their reason for not wanting to kneel could range from
    a to v--arthritis to vertigo. please inform the clergy to consider the age of
    most church congregations and use the phrase, "come forward and gather at the
    altar" instead of kneel. i''m sure the response will be greater. arthritic with

    i was invited to a baby shower and decided not to go because i hardly know the
    girl it was for. also, i would not have known any of the other girls who organized
    it if i bumped into one of them on the street. i was severely criticized because
    i didn''t call to say i wasn''t going to attend. (to tell you the truth, i forgot.)
    i was also criticized because i didn''t send a gift. abby, is a person supposed

    i''m a divorced woman who knows what it feels like to be overlooked, forgotten
    or just plain excluded on special holidays, so i round up all the "strays" i know
    and invite them over for a christmas eve meal. it''s not a formal sit-down dinner;
    it''s a casual, serve-yourself buffet sort of party, and all seem to enjoy themselves.
    well, how is this for a slap in the face? about 10 a.m., i phoned someone i thought
    would appreciate the invitation and said, "hi, if you''re not doing anything special
    tonight, come on over for dinner about 6 p.m." this friend said, "thank you, but
    i have plans." (i could tell the way she said it that she didn''t have any plans,
    but i wasn''t going to beg her.) i learned later that she sat home alone, but
    had too much pride to admit it. my question: don''t you think a person who has
    no plans is foolish to turn down an invitation for this reason? also, is there
    something wrong with the way i worded my invitation? also hurt.'

    you once said that you could usually spot a phony letter. well, today is my 70th
    birthday, and so help me, this is true. the letter in your column from "jane,"
    who refused to open the door to a stranger, struck home. on a recent saturday,
    at midnight, i was still reading when i heard a timid knock at the front door.
    i peered out, and saw a topless young lady standing there with her arms crossed!
    fearing a ruse for a robbery, i opened the door slightly and said, "yes?" she
    asked, "could you please lend me a shirt?" i said, "what happened?" she replied,
    "the guy i was riding with took my shirt. where is the nearest bus stop?" i thought,
    should i ask her in and wake my wife--she has 99 blouses--no, that might mean
    trouble, so i reached into the hall closet for an old windbreaker i use in the
    garden, and handed it out the door. she put it on and tried to work the zipper,
    but it was broken, so rather than have her stand there fussing with it, i said,
    "bring it back; here is my business card." she said, "i will. thank you, thank
    you, thank you." then she left. the next morning at breakfast i told my wife what
    happened, and she didn''t believe a word of it. now my wife thinks i lied, and
    i''m out a jacket. how should i have handled the situation? eddy hill, van nuys.'

    the letter from "south carolina pastor," who "believes in a lot of home visitations"
    and gets annoyed when people don''t turn off their tv sets during his unannounced
    visits, showed how insensitive some ministers can be. it reminded me of when i
    was a victim of the same kind of thoughtlessness. i was hospitalized in only fair
    condition with a doctor- ordered "no visitors" sign on my closed door, when in
    strolled my minister as if the sign didn''t exist. being in severe discomfort
    after a grueling morning in x-ray, all i wanted was rest and relief from pain.
    the minister proceeded to chat for 15 minutes, totally ignoring my obvious suffering.
    i finally got up the courage to tell him how sick i felt and asked him to please
    leave, whereupon he went into a long prayer! i could not believe the insensitivity
    of this man. what gives men of the cloth the right to ignore the rules of common
    courtesy by dropping by unannounced and holding people captive in their homes

    none of them caused sparks to fly--until i met "kathy" at a singles club. she''s
    35, great looking, a wonderful personality, intelligent and has two children.
    i have one. it was love at first sight--for me, anyway. the next weekend we went
    shopping at a mall. just being with kathy thrilled me. we laughed and joked, and
    i felt like a teenager again. i know she liked me, too. she was very open and
    wasn''t afraid to show affection. she spontaneously took my hand, and hugged me
    a couple of times. i wanted to be close to her, so on the way home we stopped
    (in broad daylight) and i kissed her just once and she didn''t fight me. then
    i made the mistake of my life. i said, "your place or mine? or should we stop
    at a motel?" she said, "i don''t want to be rushed into anything. please take
    me home." then her attitude changed completely. she turned very cold. i apologized
    and asked her to forgive me, but she stayed cold. i''m sure she thought i acted
    that way with every woman i met, which isn''t true. i called her the next day,
    apologized again for the way i acted and asked if i could see her again. she said,
    "no, i don''t think so." now what do i do? i have never felt this way about a
    woman in my life. should i call her again? i don''t want to make a pest of myself,

    now i''ve seen everything. "still shaking," the retired parents of a 35-year-old

    daughter to inform them that she is pregnant and thrilled. it seems that she has
    always wanted a child, and since her biological clock was running out and she
    had no man in her life, she had herself artificially inseminated! the parents
    were stunned and asked you what they should tell people. your advice, "tell them
    the truth," was correct. but what does the unmarried daughter tell her child when
    confronted with the question: "who is my father?" couples and/or singles who are
    having children by artificial insemination, surrogate parenting and the like give
    little consideration to the psychological effect of these procedures on the offspring
    so produced. "yes, dear, you were conceived when i was impregnated with a turkey

    i, too, am shaking after reading that letter about the single woman having artificial
    insemination because she wanted a baby and didn''t have a man in her life. you
    seemed to think it was perfectly all right. why didn''t you speak out against
    that stupid, selfish woman''s bringing a child into a one-parent home? that woman
    has no more right to have a baby than an unmarried 14-year-old! every child deserves
    a mother and a father. thanks to all these hot-pants teenagers, we already have
    enough one-parent families without your approving artificial insemination for
    unmarried women whose biological clocks are running out. if a single woman wants
    something to love and thinks motherhood would be fun, tell her to get a pet! disgusted

    your answer depends on whether i should apologize or not. my husband and i have

    two brothers, their wives and a total of seven children arrived unannounced. (they
    live 275 miles from here.) they said they heard the folks would be here, and they
    wanted to see them, so they invited themselves to my house for christmas. my own
    mother and two sisters-in-law sat around talking to each other while my mother-in-law
    and i prepared the entire dinner for 20 people (11 of whom had not been invited).
    the two of us served the dinner and cleaned up while everyone else entertained
    themselves. when i was hanging up my dish towel, i said to my mother-in-law, "mom,
    i could use a good stiff drink and a little peace and quiet." she said, "grab
    your coat. i''m buying." we filled in the hubbies, then mom and i went to the
    neighborhood bar for a couple of drinks. when we got home, my mother said i owed
    my guests an apology. she said, "a gracious hostess doesn''t walk out on her own
    party to get plastered somewhere else!" abby, i was not plastered, and don''t
    think i owed anybody an apology. what do you think? had it with christmas'

    john (his real name) has a nice little auto parts business in town and makes a

    may i say a few words about jogging suits for patients in a nursing home? my mother
    is in a nursing home in the midwest, and once she wore a jogging suit, she would
    wear nothing else. they are a godsend to nursing home attendants who must dress
    and undress the residents. many elderly people have poor circulation and are continually
    cold; warmup suits offer warmth. many complain of dry, delicate skin, which is
    irritated by most fabrics--warmup suits are soft and cuddly. many older people
    spill food and drink--warmup suits are easy to launder and require no ironing.
    there are other advantages: no small buttons for arthritic hands to fumble with;
    no trouser zippers to fight when a trip to the bathroom is urgent; no tugging,
    pulling or binding when lying down. one can not only lounge in them comfortably,
    but sleep in them, and they are acceptable attire for receiving guests where many
    are embarrassed by pajamas. one might also want to investigate athletic footwear
    for older people. they are comfortable, provide support and cushioning and are
    much easier on swollen joints than leather shoes. their notched rubber soles are
    an important safety factor, and they''re washable. kansas reader'

    before it starts" costs $3.50. checks should be made out to opa, and orders under

    it is not often that i am moved to respond to an item in your column, but i am
    today. it is with reference to the "stepparent" controversy. i agree with mrs.
    r., who indicates that a new mate does not automatically become a stepparent.
    my question to you, abby, is what is your frame of reference? my ex-husband''s
    wife (same age as one of my children) in no way is considered the stepmother of
    my grown adult children. if i were to remarry, my husband in no way would be considered
    any kind of parent by my kids; he would be my husband--period. what constitutes
    a parent? marriage to one? i doubt that. if the kids, after developing a relationship,
    wish to consider the person a "parent" (assuming, of course, that each of us is
    entitled to one mother and one father and, therefore, a stepparent can exist only
    when one has lost one''s natural parent), the giving of the gift of the title
    "parent" should be considered a gift of love--and not one of etiquette. n.y. fan'

    this has been bugging me for a long time and i need an answer. my husband, "nick,"
    had an affair with his sister-in-law (i''ll call her rosemary) while she and her
    husband, "tom," were living with tom''s parents. nick was living at home at the
    time because he was only 16. it seems that whenever rosemary and nick were alone
    in the house, she would come on to him. since nick had never had a girlfriend
    before, he didn''t resist her--i suppose out of curiosity and eagerness for the
    experience. anyway, this went on for some time, until guilt made nick tell his
    father about what was going on between him and rosemary. the parents made rosemary
    and tom move out of the house, and that ended the whole sordid mess. nick is now
    32 and we''ve been married for three years, but it still bothers me to be around
    tom and rosemary. nick says he still feels guilty, but he''s trying to forget
    it ever happened. lately he''s started going over to tom''s because they have
    a common interest in horses, riding, etc. whenever we are around them, rosemary
    makes it a point to get near nick and talk to him (as much as he lets her), and
    she sometimes calls the house and asks to speak to nick--supposedly to tell him
    something for tom. this situation is driving me nuts. how can i get over these
    feelings of jealousy and anger? nick wants to be able to see his brother without
    any trouble from me, but i''m not big enough to handle it. what should i do? can''t

    is it true that in hollywood if an actress is good for a part but needs a few
    alterations (physically), they can fix just about anything? i read somewhere that
    if a woman is skinny or has bony parts, she can be filled in with silicone. like
    in that song from "a chorus line," "t and a is where it''s at." well, i have plenty
    of "t" and "a," but the calves of my legs are very thin and my knees are bony.
    the rest of me is just fine, but my legs are so shapeless i hate to show them.
    plastic surgeons can perform miracles with a face-lift, so why should giving a
    woman shapely calves be so difficult? where can i find a doctor who does this
    kind of work? i have the funds to handle it, so that''s no problem. please don''t

    no one can see beyond the brave front they put on, to comprehend the uncompleted

    what''s so "bizarre and mysterious" about the situation described by "forgotten

    to repay it within three years on a monthly basis (no interest). four years ago
    he walked out of his parents'' lives without a word of explanation. his business
    is thriving and he lives with his wife and children two miles away, but his parents--now
    in their 70s--haven''t had a phone call, card, gift, visit--nothing. all communication
    ceased. the parents ask, "where did we go wrong? we have never mentioned the $10,000
    he owed." the same thing happened to us. only it was our son-in-law. the reason
    for the break in communication is clear to us. he doesn''t want to pay back the
    money. he feels guilty, but not guilty enough to repay it, so he just "disappears."

    now i have really heard it all. "parents of the bride" write that their adopted
    daughter is planning to be married. she has found her natural family and wants
    to include them in the wedding party, so how should the wedding invitations read?
    can''t you just see them: "mr. and mrs. william smith request your presence at
    the marriage of their adopted daughter, joan, in the presence of her natural parents,
    mr. and mrs. george gotlost, to peter jordan, the natural son of mr. and mrs.
    henry jordan." oh, come on, abby. you say if there is any awkwardness insofar
    as you, or the natural parents are concerned, identifying labels should be omitted.
    how could there not be awkwardness? if the bride who has suddenly found her birth
    parents wants to invite them to her wedding, that''s lovely. but i think they
    should slip in the back door of the church, watch the wedding and slip out again.
    i''ll bet you get plenty of mail on this. in shock in columbus'

    i am a 30-year-old divorcee. i married larry (not his real name) when i was 16
    and left him (like a fool) for another man when i was 18. i never realized what
    a jewel larry was until it was too late. larry got married and now he has three
    children. in the meantime, i''ve been living with this other guy, "barney," for
    six years. we have a child but we''re not married yet. we plan to make it legal
    in the near future. i have always regretted leaving larry and have prayed for
    a reconciliation, but after all these years i never thought i had a chance. well,
    i ran into him two weeks ago in a parking lot, and it was like our very first
    meeting all over again! we have seen each other a couple of times since and now
    he wants to leave his wife and marry me. should i leave barney and go back to
    larry? let me know soon. barney and i are booked on a cruise, and we''ll lose

    in a recent column, "modern mom" said that a child''s bedroom should be a private,
    comfortable place to call his own and, unlike most mothers, she did not believe
    in screaming at a child to clean up his room. then you said: "i agree. keep the
    door closed and go in once a week to rake it," and added, "if there is any snacking
    in the room, insist that all dishes and leftovers should be taken to the kitchen
    before bedtime." thanks for that, abby, but most child psychologists advocate
    training children to keep neat and orderly rooms. they say parents who allow their
    children to live in messy rooms are abdicating their responsibilities as parents.

    our daughter was recently married and we gave her a lovely wedding and reception.
    the dinner was buffet style. we have some cousins whom we invite to all the family
    celebrations. they are not poor by any means, but they have a peculiar habit of
    bringing small plastic bags to these events and filling them with food from the
    buffet table to take home. at our daughter''s wedding, several people, including
    the caterers, came to me aghast, suggesting that we had uninvited guests at the
    buffet table. on noting they were our cousins, i verified that they had been invited.
    i chose not to say anything to them as i did not want to create a scene or make
    anyone feel uncomfortable. the problem: our son is getting married this summer
    and the bride''s family is having a similar wedding reception, including a buffet,
    to which these cousins will be invited. how can i tactfully discourage them from
    a repeat of their usual buffet raiding? when we were the hosts it was bad enough,
    but to have this occur at our son''s wedding, when we are not the hosts, would
    be humiliating. we''d like to prevent this from happening. any suggestions from
    you or your readers would be most appreciated. perplexed in washington state'

    illness and subsequent death, we were given dozens of food items in "nice" containers.
    the last thing i needed at the time was the worry about returning the containers.
    it hung over my head for months, making a traumatic time even more stressful.
    so if you really want to make things easier for those who are grieving, send your
    offerings in plastic, foil or paper. also, please keep your cakes, and give me
    carrots! i put on 25 pounds eating all those "goodies." and don''t tell me i should

    i am writing in reference to your column signed "anna in hillsboro, ore.," whose
    father was denied treatment at the va hospital because he was first admitted to
    a civilian hospital. while the advice you gave her--"get the book, ''viet vet
    survival guide,'' and learn what your rights are"--was good, i am highly incensed
    by your comment, "realizing that the average vietnam veteran did not get past
    high school, the authors use plain language and short sentences." where and how
    did you come by such ridiculous information? as if we do not have enough falsehoods
    to overcome, we now have been classified as practically illiterate! i quote from
    facts and fiction, taken from the national vietnam veterans review (nov. 1982):
    fiction: high school dropouts formed the largest proportion of u.s. forces in
    vietnam. fact: 79 percent of those who served in vietnam had a high school education
    or better when they entered the military service. fact: this was the best-educated
    army america has ever fielded. for comparison, 63 percent of korean war vets,
    and only 45 percent of wwii vets, had completed high school upon separation from
    the military. i think you owe the vietnam veterans an apology. we''ve had enough
    bum raps over the years without your undeserved putdown. vietnam veteran'

    concerning disclosing one''s religion and marital status on a hospital form for
    a goiter x-ray: you are correct in stating that a patient does not have to answer
    those questions. any patient or potential patient told that "unless you complete
    the form there will be no x-ray," should ask to see that employee''s supervisor.
    if the supervisor has no better answer, one should request to see the department
    supervisor. no luck? go all the way to the top and report to the facility''s administrator.
    health-care facilities in today''s competitive health-care environment are not
    turning away potential patients simply because they refuse to indicate religious
    preference and/or marital status. many of your readers are not aware that such
    a profession (medical record administrator/health information specialist) exists.

    to "forgotten parents," who loaned their son $10,000 10 years ago that never has
    been (and likely never will be) repaid, and to all those who wrote in to say,
    "the same thing happened to us," you gave sound advice: "never lend money without
    a promissory note acknowledging the loan and stating the terms of repayment. relatives
    are no exception." having made my first million by the time i was 30 and multiplying
    it several times since then, and coming from a large working-class family, i am
    often confronted with the problem of a relative in "desperate" need of a loan.
    here is an even better way to handle it: develop a relationship with a bank--most
    people with even $5,000 or $10,000 to lend will know their banker. when a relative
    asks for a loan, tell him (or her) that you''re not in the business of lending
    money, but your bank is. his credit lousy? or he wouldn''t qualify for that much?
    you''ll assist him. then go to your banker and pledge your money, on deposit with
    the bank, as security for the loan. the bank will happily make the loan, since
    their risk is zero. your relative gets his money, so he''s happy. true, you still
    stand to lose your money if he defaults, but there are several advantages to doing
    it this way: 1. the bank will make him fill out a loan application, sign a promissory
    note, maybe even get him to pledge some collateral of his own, however insufficient.
    it makes the borrower feel "on the hook" and, in fact, his credit rating is at
    issue if he defaults. 2. it takes you out of the position of creditor and collection
    agent, which puts a strain on the best of personal relationships. the interest
    that the borrower owes is paid to the bank, not to you, so no hard feelings. 3.
    meanwhile, you continue to get interest on your money deposited in the bank. 4.
    if the borrower pays the loan as promised, that''s an enhancement to his credit
    rating, and thus an incentive for him to go this route as well. i''ve handled
    several loans to relatives, friends and employees this way and haven''t gotten
    stung yet. sometimes the borrower, when confronted with the bank''s forbidding
    paperwork, will back off altogether and miraculously find some other way to solve
    his financial problem. anyway, it''s not foolproof, but it''s the best solution
    to the situation i''ve found. sign me beverly hills benefactor'

    appointment at the pediatrician''s, and left the office feeling glum. our 5-year-old
    had been pleading for a kitten for several months, so we decided to take the advice
    in your st. valentine''s day column and adopt a pet. we went to our humane society
    to get a kitten. we learned that the kitten we selected would cost $45, which
    included initial shots and spaying/neutering at six months of age. we''d just
    written our last check at the doctor''s office, so my husband and i counted our
    monies and came up with $43.78 cash. abby, they let us walk out with two crying
    girls. we could have given that kitten a perfect home, but being short $1.22 stood
    in our way. is that crazy or am i crazy? feeling bad in birmingham'

    to be executed. in 1839, one vote elected marcus morton governor of massachusetts.
    in 1845, one vote brought texas into the union. in 1868, one vote saved president
    andrew johnson from impeachment. in 1876, one vote changed france from a monarchy
    to a republic. in 1923, one vote gave adolf hitler leadership of the nazi party.

    re the woman who hated her thin legs and inquired about silicone injections to
    make them more shapely: you advised her to consult three plastic surgeons before
    making that decision. very good advice, abby. i hope she took it. seventeen years
    ago, i consulted a plastic surgeon about the identical problem. my big mistake
    was consulting only one doctor. he assured me that silicone augmentation to fill
    out my calves was a simple procedure and involved very little risk. i went ahead
    with it, and within a few days i noticed that the silicone had started to run
    down my ankle area! not only did it look terrible, it was very painful when bumped.
    shortly afterward, this doctor left town suddenly and was not to be found. a few
    years later, i read in the newspaper that he had been charged with wrongful death
    and malpractice suits in another state. now i must wrap my legs with ace bandages
    daily and elevate my legs periodically to keep the silicone out of the ankle area.
    however, the silicone still gradually migrates down to my ankles. please keep
    repeating your advice to those who inquire about any kind of surgical procedure
    to get a second opinion. and a third is better yet. sorry i didn''t confidential

    you have often been asked a question like this: i am a 26- year-old female who
    would like to meet a decent, eligible man. i''ve tried the bar scene, but most
    men are after a one-night stand. i''ve tried church groups, but the few men who
    are present came because their wives made them go. so where do i go from here?
    abby, i have a suggestion: join a chess club. women are always welcome. furthermore,
    they will find that men outnumber women 10-to-1. not bad odds! also, from 25 percent
    to 40 percent of the men will be unmarried. men who play chess on a regular basis
    are usually of good character. the game requires that the player make individual,
    intelligent, patient and logical decisions. these attributes carry over into everyday
    life. for example, i estimate that 95 percent of steady tournament players do
    not smoke, and i have never met one who abuses alcohol or drugs. they are almost
    always employed, are high achievers and have a stable family life. a woman could
    counter with, "but i don''t know anything about chess." well, that could be to
    her advantage. what better way to break the ice than to ask a man of her choice
    to show her the moves? if you print this, some women will probably write in and
    say, "i married a chess player, and you can have him!" i realize that not every
    chess player is necessarily an ideal prospect for marriage, but it''s a good way
    to meet eligible men. lyle prosterman, columbus'

    my husband was helping his mom clean out her attic when they came across some
    stuff his father had brought home from world war ii. (his father died 20 years
    ago.) one of the things was a hand grenade, still intact. it had never been used.
    my husband wants to keep it as a souvenir. you can probably guess what my problem
    is. i''m scared to death the thing is going to blow up, but my husband says it
    has been in the attic for nearly 40 years and nothing has happened yet, so there
    is no danger. can you ask your experts what might happen to it if it just sits
    around any longer? my husband says maybe we should have it deactivated. that would
    be all right with me, but whom would we take it to? i''ve been losing sleep over
    this. sign me . . . sitting on a time bomb'

    you frequently counsel your readers to seek the sympathetic ear of their pastors.
    though it''s sound advice for the most part, i would caution them to ask first
    what the fee will be. in deep unhappiness, i recently sought solace by talking
    with a "certified pastoral counselor," only to be handed a bill for $65 at the
    end of the session. i could ill afford that amount, and it was not covered by
    my insurance. this man came recommended by our church, and i was too naive to
    consider that a pastoral counselor might expect me to pay for his closer affinity
    to god. needless to say, it was not an uplifting experience. so please advise
    your readers to always ask ahead of time, "how much?" stung in new hampshire'

    i dated a superman for a year. he boards with a family who loves him like a son.
    he gave me a ring and we planned a february wedding. this other family found out
    about me and threw him out, so he moved in with me. on the fourth day he cried
    and wanted to return to the family he was living with. he said he missed the children.
    so that''s where he is living now. i told him i needed six months to think things
    over, but now he''s pressuring me to marry him. my friends and family keep asking
    me when i''m going to get married. it''s kind of embarrassing because we bought

    i would like to respond to "william in butler, pa.," who describes himself as
    "34, fairly good-looking, unemployed and tired of being turned down by greedy
    women because i''m broke." i am a 36-year-old single woman, and although i would
    dearly love to meet a nice man, i, too, would hesitate to date a man like william.
    i''m not after anyone''s money, as i have a good job and can support myself. it''s
    just that i expect an adult person to work. william, if you are unemployed because
    you were recently laid off from your job, you have my sympathy. but perhaps your
    priority at this time should be finding another job, rather than trying to date.
    are you unemployed because you dropped out of high school, or never bothered to
    get any vocational or professional training? no sympathy. get some. are you unemployed
    because you refuse to take any of the low-paying jobs that seem to be available
    right now? no sympathy. check the want ads. any job is better than no job. are
    you unemployed because you are physically disabled? i personally know paraplegics
    and quadriplegics who hold down good jobs that require mental and verbal skills.
    this goes for deaf and blind people, too, who develop their skills. no sympathy.
    maybe the women who refuse to date you are not greedy. they may assume that you
    lack motivation. or perhaps they are afraid to try a relationship that they may
    have to finance. my advice--stop whining and get a job. nobody likes a loafer.

    there are certain roles that mark a performer forever. sean connery will inexorably
    be james bond, and who can think of vivien leigh apart from scarlett o''hara?
    humphrey bogart played many roles, but for most of us, he will always be rick,
    who came for the waters and ended up with a beautiful friendship. giulietta masina
    shares this fate. for the 32 years since she overwhelmed the film world with her
    portrayal of gelsomina in "la strada," she has always been the warmhearted innocent,
    the foolish little waif, the 33-year-old who looked like the 14-year-old circus
    performer. she is the pantomimist who promised to be a female charlie chaplin.
    some of her subsequent films with her director-husband federico fellini won acclaim,
    notably her portrayal of a prostitute in "nights of cabiria." but even as a prostitute,
    she was an innocent, kindhearted, far more sinned against than sinning, trusting
    everyone and maintaining hope even when everything seemed lost. in an odd sort
    of way, masina''s return for american audiences in fellini''s "ginger and fred,"
    opening friday in chicago, follows the same scenario. she is no longer 14, but
    as the faded dancer ginger, masina finds herself making an absurd comeback by
    way of an appalling television variety show. co- starring with marcello mastroianni
    for the first time, although each of them has made four films with fellini, masina
    plays a wistful character who revisits rome to be reunited for television with
    her former partner in a dance act once known as ginger and fred. television, as
    depicted by fellini, is at least as corrupting as the circus--or prostitution.
    moreover, just as masina''s roles in earlier fellini films called upon her to
    be sold into the circus and forced into prostitution, she now finds herself conned
    into coming back, against her better judgment, by her broken-down former dancing
    partner. and the traumas of the circus and the humiliations of prostitution are
    nothing compared to the grotesqueries of the world of popular television, as conceived
    by fellini. yet, at the end of "ginger and fred," as always, giulietta masina
    is still smiling, jauntily mugging her way through life--just the way she seems
    to do offscreen. the torrent of words comes through a persistent cloud of cigarette
    smoke as she speaks of her past and present in her elegant via margutta apartment.
    but when the words stop and an aperture opens in the smoke, there is the famous
    smile. now 65 years old, she says she doesn''t mind a bit that when people think
    of of giulietta masina, they imagine her still as the waiflike gelsomina of "la
    strada." when she speaks of the film, it is clear that for her, to be remembered
    for association with one great film is satisfaction enough for a lifetime. "if
    an actress has the luck to do an important film with an important director, and
    in an important role," she says, "it''s natural that it remains." "la strada"
    seems to follow her everywhere. "four years ago i was coming back from san francisco,"
    she recalls. "on the way back i stopped in new york. that night i stayed at the
    hotel because i was tired. and in my room, i switched on the tv and started changing
    channels, and after few channels what do i see: ''la strada.'' " it is no accident
    that masina has maintained a certain consistency in the roles she has played.
    after "la strada," a 1954 release and an oscar-winner in 1956 as the best foreign
    film, it was difficult, even frightening, to contemplate other roles. "success
    also means being careful not to make mistakes because you develop a certain kind
    of fear," she says. "you are scared to accept roles which are different. you are
    scared that you will cancel the success you had. you are scared to disappoint
    the critics and the public. "and so," she says, "sometimes i refused roles which
    i am now convinced i could do very well, but they were very different characters.
    "the public had seen me like gelsomina, like a clown, and then in ''cabiria,''
    " she says, referring to her role as a prostitute. "to see me in a realistic role,
    as a wife with her husband and her lover, i don''t know how the public would have
    reacted, accepted that." she chuckles, as she often does, explaining why it wasn''t
    hard to turn down other roles. "they don''t pay me like al pacino or de niro,"
    she says. the result is that she has had major roles in but nine major films during
    the last three decades, though she is well known in italy for her career on television.
    she has chosen to fill the rest of her life with work for unicef, a decade''s
    worth of work on a "dear abby"-like newspaper column and trying to tend to fellini,
    her husband for 42 years of complex but enduring relationship. but as she tells
    it, the whole idea of "ginger and fred" came up as part of a broader project designed
    precisely to change the image of women in italian film. masina was thinking of
    doing television productions--despite the theme of "ginger and fred," she is fond
    of television--of six short films on six modern feminine characters, directed
    by six different directors: "a housewife, a lawyer, a nurse, a crazy one, and
    so on." the idea the series was designed to counter, she said, was that italian
    women seem to be associated with just one thing. "the woman in movies was always
    the girl that falls in love, makes love and so forth," she said. "i think there
    are different women in society who work, live in their society, who are teachers,
    lawyers, doctors, nurses, ministers, members of parliament, and who deal with
    other things and not only with ''that'' thing. "there''s nothing wrong with ''that,''
    " she laughs, "but there are other things in life." one of the characters for
    the series was "ginger," she says, and alberto grimaldi, the producer, insisted
    that fellini make a separate film about her. and so he did. fellini, it turns
    out, has much the same image of his wife as does the rest of the world. in his
    view, she was an inevitable ginger. "the idea, the little script of the film,
    was born in her," fellini says, "on that emotional mixture of stubbornness, optimism,
    faith, childlike enthusiasm, with good sense and the concreteness of daily life."
    fellini says that his wife sometimes resists his view of her talents, which he
    summarizes as "a mingling of youngish and clownish." but make no mistake: in suggesting
    that his wife is a clown, fellini means no insult. "the clown is the aristocracy
    of acting," he says. "to be a clown means to have the possibility of making people
    cry and laugh." yet working for your husband as director--especially, it seems,
    if it is fellini--is clearly not the easiest thing in the world. "it''s much easier
    with another director," masina says with a chuckle. "i feel freer, as strange
    as it may seem. "federico is a man who talks very little," she adds. "when i do
    well, the way he wants it, he knows immediately and lets me do it. but when he
    thinks i see things differently from him then it''s more difficult. he wants the
    maximum from me." the success of masina''s performance in "ginger and fred" lies
    partly in the fact that she seems constantly out of place, a smiling and loving
    woman in the midst of the zoo of fellini''s world of television. add to this mastroianni,
    who wears the mask of a man near death and stumbles through his dance routine
    with the delicacy of a gorilla. in the midst of such a world, the most thoroughly
    absurd character turns out to be the ever sane, ever optimistic ginger."in normality,
    there is the greatest abnormality," masina says. "in fact ginger, among all these
    crazy people, seems more abnormal than the others--all that curiosity, a character
    who keeps all her energy, while marcello''s character is tired, older inside."

    why all the letters about bald men? what makes people think a man needs hair in

    the risk of getting aids is to use a condom religiously?" abby, how does one use
    a condom "religiously"? put it on and pray? or use it only on sundays? amused'

    my husband and i have been reading your column for many years but have never read
    anything about a problem we are currently having. several years ago, when our
    daughter "patti" was in her teens, i put down one of her girlfriends for sporting
    several conspicuous tattoos on her arm. in a fit of rebellion, patti went out
    and had several tattoos engraved on her arm! they are not tiny butterflies or
    pretty flowers; these tattoos are conspicuous, obscene and ugly. now that patti
    is a young woman in her 20s, she regrets having had those tattoos. she''s a bright
    and capable businesswoman and fears that these tattoos could cause her to be passed
    over for promotions. her father and i are willing to pay for having them removed,
    but we don''t know if tattoos can be removed, and if so, how? you may answer this

    as a licensed hairstylist, i have been asked the same two questions at least once
    a day for the last 25 years, so maybe if you answer them in your column, people
    will quit asking. question no. 1: "what do you charge for just a little trim?"
    first of all, the client pays for the barber''s expertise-- not for the amount
    of hair that is cut off and swept up. also, "a little trim" usually requires some
    styling, shaping, thinning and cutting, so the price is the same as a regular
    haircut. question no. 2: "how much do you charge for children?" for some strange
    reason, most people seem to think that a child''s haircut should cost half as
    much as an adult''s. actually it should cost twice as much, because it takes twice
    as long to give a child a proper haircut, and it''s twice as much work. (i personally
    feel as though i''ve wrestled 10 rounds with a gorilla after cutting a child''s
    hair.) please print this. i''d like to frame it and hang it in my shop. jacques

    my wife and i are retired. we had a second car that we no longer needed, so we
    decided to sell it. i parked the car on our front lawn with a "for sale" sign
    on the windshield. during the noon hour, a young man rang our doorbell and said
    he was looking for a second car for his wife. (she was waiting in their car, in
    our driveway.) i went out, unlocked the door and started the engine. he asked
    the price and seemed interested. then he asked if he could drive it around the
    block. i said he could, so he motioned for his wife to come. he asked her if she
    would like to drive. she got under the wheel, and he got in on the passenger side.
    she backed the car into the street, and they drove away. thirty minutes later,
    they had not returned, so i called the police. a policeman came out and checked
    the car this couple had left behind. it had been stolen in oklahoma city--some
    35 miles away. this happened three weeks ago and our car is still missing. how
    could this have been avoided? c.a. henley, tecumseh, okla.'

    my mother keeps sending me clippings from your column about "forgiving," as part
    of her campaign to reconcile my brother and me, so i hope she sees this. my mother
    was aware that my brother had physically and verbally abused me throughout our
    childhood, but she wrote it off as "sibling rivalry." she never knew that when
    i was very young and he was in his teens he raped me and continued to sexually
    abuse me over several years. i could never bring myself to tell her because like
    most victims, i thought she would either blame me or simply say i was lying. i
    have only recently begun to deal with this childhood trauma. as a result of my
    rage and anger toward my brother, i cannot bear to be in the same room with him.
    over the years (and it''s been 35 years now) he has been cold and distant toward
    me. i could possibly forgive him if he acknowledged his wrongdoing and showed
    some remorse for what he did to me. instead, he''s become a judgmental hypocrite
    who constantly quotes scripture. mother is in her 70s and continues to tell me
    how unhappy she is that my brother and i don''t "love" each other. how can i tell
    her now? she''d probably say, "why don''t you just forget it--it happened a long
    time ago." i''m tired of her nagging me to reach out to my brother. by the way,
    she doesn''t nag him or send him clippings, because she thinks it''s all my fault.

    the adoption fee for a kitten. you called the people at the humane society "insensitive
    and petty" for not giving her the kitten anyway. abby, there may have been other
    reasons the adoption was denied. first of all, the mother said her daughters had
    just left the dentist''s office "feeling glum" and she wanted to get them a pet
    to cheer them up. pets are living creatures--not toys to be bought on an impulse
    to cheer up a child. also, the children were 2 and 5. at our shelter we don''t
    even consider adoption of small puppies and kittens to children under 6 years
    old. we''ve seen too many cases of pets (and children) being seriously injured.
    third, how were the people at the humane society to know whether the family could
    afford to care properly for the pet if they couldn''t come up with the price of
    adoption? we''ve had pets returned to us because they were too expensive to care
    for. some people don''t realize that sick animals may need to be taken to the
    vet. and it costs something to feed them properly. abby, put your claws back in.

    regarding your response that a "thank-you" scribbled on the back of a check (given
    as a gift) is better than no thank-you at all: not in our case. my husband and
    i have checking accounts in three separate financial institutions, none of which
    return the original checks with their statements. so a thank-you would never be
    seen by either one of us. so, for those who are too lazy to write a thank-you
    note for a check, a telephone thank-you would be better than none at all. the
    common courtesy of a thank-you note is a combination of personal caring for the
    feelings of others, sincere gratitude and parental teaching. i have a 12-year-old
    niece who still does not write a thank-you note unless i make a federal case out
    of it. for her 13th birthday, instead of a gift, i plan to write her a letter
    explaining that i am tired of having to ask for a thank-you, so i''m not sending
    her anything. think she''ll get the message? (her mother is just as bad.) chris

    at the most expensive hall in boston. abby, these are young kids who have nothing.
    i was informed that our share would be $4,500. i told evelyn we didn''t have that
    kind of money, that $1,000 was our limit. she hung up on me. i called a few days
    later and asked how many guests we could invite to the reception. "for $1,000,"
    she said, "one couple." i was furious and went right to her house to talk to her.
    she said i was living in the dark ages if i thought the parents of the bride still
    paid for the whole wedding with no help from the groom''s side. she repeated,
    our share was $4,500. i said, "people who put on showy weddings they can''t afford
    are four-flushers." then the father of the bride threw me out of the house! now

    here''s the big problem: last winter melanie''s sister, judy, sent us an announcement
    of her marriage, which took place in las vegas. we immediately sent word to melanie
    asking her to send the wedding gift she received from us to her sister who was
    really married. then we wrote a letter of congratulations to judy telling her
    to expect our gift soon. as of today we have not heard a word from either melanie

    this concerns the american woman signed "moonstruck," who was in love with an
    iranian man and wanted to marry him. i married a man from a middle eastern country
    so perhaps i can give her some advice. we have been married for 15 years and i
    couldn''t want a better husband, but not all american women have been as lucky
    with men from foreign countries. here are some things to consider: 1. what kind
    of visa does he have? if he already has a green card, he''s probably a good bet.
    some men marry american women just to get permanent resident status in this country.
    an american woman should be cautious about marrying someone who is on a tourist
    or student visa. she should also be aware that if she does marry a foreigner with
    a criminal record or who is considered to be an undesirable alien, he could be
    deported even if he is already married to an american. 2. how long have you known
    each other? marrying someone from a different country, especially if there are
    language barriers and vast cultural differences, can create serious problems.
    don''t rush into marriage. get to know each other very, very well. if it''s love,
    the waiting won''t hurt. 3. could you be happy living in his country? you may
    have to if things don''t work out for him here. and if the political situation
    in his country changes for the better, he may want to return and take you with
    him. how would you feel about that? the voice of experience'

    help us, please. my husband and i own a business and employ 12 people. one of

    a few times, and i have never met sue. my husband and i, and every one of our
    employees, have received an invitation to sue''s wedding. today patricia called
    and invited me to a bridal shower she is having for sue. then she asked me to
    call all the women who work for us as well as the wives and girlfriends of our

    know what to say at the time. abby, i would feel very uncomfortable inviting these
    people to a shower for someone i don''t even know. also, if a person is invited
    to a shower and doesn''t go, does she have to send a gift? and correct me if i

    a good friend of mine in farmington hills, mich., recently sent me some of your
    columns from the detroit news. the subject: "where do the people of scotland,
    great britain and wales get their strange eating habits?" i think the question
    should be, "where did you americans acquire yours?" although i am a welshman,
    i believe i know the answer. much of the early eating in the states was done on
    the trail. since it was probably more comfortable to eat in the saddle than to
    sit on the ground, the cowpoke remained mounted, feeding himself with his right
    hand while using his left hand to prevent his falling off his horse. this undoubtedly
    accounts for the predominant use of the right hand in the united states. further
    on the subject of insularity, while on a flight from chicago to akron, i was engaged
    in a conversation with a matronly woman. after some time she asked, "what is your
    mother tongue, young man?" she looked at me with astonishment when i replied,
    "it''s english." after she had recovered her composure, she drawled grudgingly,
    "well, i guess they can speak it over there, too." no doubt, shakespeare turned

  body: 'dear dr. johnson: are the strokes attributed to the birth control pill the
    same kind of strokes older people have? there are three major causes of strokes.
    one is a blood clot that forms in the blood vessels leading to the brain, thereby
    cutting off blood flow--a so-called cerebral thrombosis. the second major cause
    is a blood clot that travels to the brain from the blood vessel system down in
    the body or neck--a so-called cerebral embolus. the third cause is a leakage in
    a blood vessel that leads to actual bleeding into brain tissue. in the case of
    elderly people, the most common cause of a stroke is the cerebral thrombosis,
    usually occurring in an area where the artery is already narrowed by the buildup
    of fatty material in the blood vessel (atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries).
    however, strokes that occur in younger women related to the use of the birth control
    pill are more likely to be hemorrhagic strokes, that is, bleeding strokes. it
    is thought that both the estrogen and progestin components of birth control pills
    (the two major female hormones) contribute to this small but definite increased
    risk for strokes. that risk is thought to have decreased considerably in recent
    years because of the lower amounts of hormones used in modern birth control pills.'

    this is a minister''s response to the problem created by small children who disrupt
    wedding ceremonies by becoming restless, talkative and whining. the parents you
    wrote about pushed past the ushers who politely asked them to leave the child
    in the church nursery, which was staffed with licensed attendants. you were asked,
    "how can a situation like this be prevented?" your reply: "it can''t, unless bouncers
    are enlisted!" i have a better solution: when planning the wedding with the bride
    and groom, i ask their permission to make an announcement before the wedding.
    if they agree (and so far they all have), i walk out in front of the guests, the
    organist lowers the volume to almost nothing, then i say, "my name is pastor paul,
    and i have two very important requests to make on behalf of the bride and groom:
    the first: please do not take any flash pictures during the ceremony. the second:
    if you have a small child who begins to cry, please do not wait, hoping the child
    will stop, but take the child out immediately so that others will be able to enjoy
    the ceremony." the above has worked very well, underscoring an old adage: an ounce
    of prevention is worth a pound of cure. the rev. paul mckowen fremont, calif.

    a year and he asked me to go to bed with him. my mother knows about my relationship
    with him, but i''m afraid to tell her about this because i don''t know what her
    reaction will be. i told him i wasn''t sure if i was ready yet. he told me that
    he won''t rush me into anything i don''t want to do. how do i know when i''m ready?
    i hope you print this because i think you will be helping other girls with the
    same problem. afraid of love'

    our family is approaching a time of dissension concerning the upcoming wedding
    of our eldest daughter. recent weddings of friends and family have been real "blowouts,"
    each trying to outdo the last. my wife and daughters keep talking about the reception,
    dresses, flowers and tuxedos as if we had a mature money tree. they justify a
    "nice" wedding for the "memories" it will make. i believe that a "nice" wedding
    can consist of a bride''s gown, and simple dresses for the ladies that won''t
    cost them a fortune--and ones they can wear again. and what''s wrong with dark
    blue suits for the guys, a few simple bouquets, and cake and punch for the reception?
    we aren''t rich, but we meet our needs and have no bad debt problems--yet! my
    wife uses coupons to shop at the grocery store and she manages our daily money
    matters very well, but no amount of coupons will be able to cover the disaster
    they are planning. what do you say? has the ladder set up'

    i read with great interest the letter about "new mexico mess," about a 15-year-old
    grandson who was sexually involved with an 18- year-old girl. two years ago our
    son, who was 15 at the time, became involved with "lilly"--an 18-year-old girl.
    lilly came to our home in the afternoons while we were gone and went to bed with
    him. her parents were aware of this, but did nothing. we contacted two lawyers
    and an assistant district attorney. they all gave us the same advice. in texas,
    an 18-year-old boy can be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a 15-year-old
    girl, but there is no law to protect a minor boy from an 18-year-old girl! when
    lilly became pregnant, her parents demanded that our son marry her! of course,
    we refused to allow our 15-year-old son to marry her. we begged lilly to give
    up the baby for adoption. she refused. our son is now a 17-year- old high school
    dropout. he lives with lilly and the baby, working two jobs to pay the rent. we
    provide for the baby, pay a sitter during the week and care for the child on weekends.
    lilly sleeps late and works part time. her parents contribute nothing. our friends
    tell us to wash our hands of the whole mess, but we feel that an innocent baby
    would suffer if we did. do you have an answer to this horrible situation? no names

    my fiance is in the army, stationed in england. he will be coming home in three
    weeks and our wedding is scheduled for exactly one week later. he shipped all
    his clothes home for me to launder. one of the boxes had a funny smell when it
    arrived, and when i unpacked it, i found a large pile of socks at the bottom.
    you probably won''t believe this, but there were 203 pairs of dirty, black dress
    socks in that box. i counted them--406 dirty socks! my question: should i go ahead
    and marry a man who would leave such a dirty job for a woman to do? i am afraid
    that this might be symbolic evidence of an unconscious lack of respect for women,
    and after we are married i will be expected to do the dirty work. hurry your answer,

    thanks for informing your readers that the effectiveness of birth control pills
    can be diminished or canceled out if the woman takes antibiotics. as a practicing
    certified nurse and midwife, i have known this to happen many times. the woman
    then says, "but nobody told me!" the problem is that the doctor who prescribed
    the antibiotics is not the same doctor who prescribed the birth control pills.
    also, when a doctor asks a patient, "are you on any kind of medication?" the patient
    says, "no"--not thinking of the pill as "medication." south carolina midwife confidential

    for writing: no matter what i send her, it is "lost"--or to be frank, it''s stolen--within
    a week or two. i have been told by the staff that theft is rampant in the best
    of nursing homes, and they cannot control it. i was shocked when mother''s wedding
    ring and watch were "lost" the day after she arrived. before mother''s day i was
    completely frustrated. i am accustomed to sending her lovely nightgowns, robes
    and slippers, but have been advised to send nothing of value. i want to send her
    a cassette player. it would be a comfort to her and i could select some "old favorites"
    on tape for her listening pleasure, but the people in charge have told me not
    to send it because it would vanish "overnight," and they cannot be responsible
    for it. mother likes the home and has become very attached to some of the staff,

    suggestions? other nursing homes in the area have acknowledged the same problem.

    you seem to have a lot of compassion for us senior citizens, so maybe you can
    do something about this problem. i am not the only one this has happened to; many
    of my friends complain of the same situation: the doctor writes a prescription
    for $90 worth of medicine. you take four of one kind, two of another kind and
    three of the third kind every day. you get all kinds of bad reactions from the
    pills, so the doctor changes your medication, leaving you with about $80 worth
    of pills you can''t use. "flush them down the toilet," he says, "so you won''t
    take them by mistake!" why can''t the doctor prescribe a small amount to begin
    with? you can always get a refill if the medication works, and if it doesn''t,
    you won''t be stuck with a lot of pills you can''t use. the druggist says it''s
    against the law for him to take back pills once they are out of the store. too
    bad i don''t know another poor person who could use these useless pills prescribed
    for me. i would be glad to give them mine. i have a medicine cabinet full of them.

    rita (not her real name) and i just split up after a three- year relationship.
    she''s 25 and i am 28. during the time we went together, i gave rita many gifts.
    some were expensive and others were not, but i asked her to return all my gifts.
    (she had given me some gifts, too, which i returned, although she told me she
    didn''t want them.) well, last sunday morning i found all the gifts i had given
    her dumped on my front lawn! of course my neighbors saw this stuff on my lawn,
    and now i''m the laughingstock of the neighborhood. how would you handle this?
    i had given rita a three-piece set of patio furniture, a microwave oven, a stereo,
    and about 20 stuffed animals. and to think i almost married her! burned up in

    i am a woman of 62, widowed a year, after a long and happy marriage. fortunately
    i have many supportive friends who have made my loss more bearable by their concern
    and attention. my problem concerns two longtime friends of my husband. both have
    come on to me with pompous offers to alleviate my "sexual frustrations." can you

    the other is more persistent. i am unable to avoid him because his wife is a very
    good friend of mine and we see each other often, so i have been indulging in the
    following fantasy: i set the time for our rendezvous, leaving the door to my house
    unlocked. he enters my house and gropes his way to my dimly lit bedroom, which
    i have generously sprayed with chanel no. 5. as he approaches my bed, i reach
    up and turn on the bright overhead light. i am lying draped in my late husband''s
    old government-issue bathrobe. my face is devoid of makeup, my hair is in rollers
    and my partial plate is on the bedside table. i smile widely, revealing the large
    hole left when i lost a front tooth in a skiing accident years ago. as i open
    my arms, my bathrobe falls open, revealing the orthopedic corset i wear to relieve
    the chronic pain of a bad back. "come to me," i whisper huskily . . . how''s that
    for a seductive scene? of course, i doubt if i''d ever carry it out--or should

    re "forgotten parents" who loaned their son $10,000 and never heard from him again:

    all contact with the person who lent it to me. why? i feel so guilty about not
    being able to repay any of it that i can''t look him in the eye--so i avoid him.
    conversely, years ago, i loaned yet another family member a large sum of money.
    he was never in a position to repay me, and the same thing happened. (he avoided
    me.) however, i forgave him the debt entirely and told him that he didn''t owe
    me a cent. after that, our relationship was fully restored and now we are close

    this is for "perplexed mother" who heard through the grapevine that some of her
    children think she overstays her welcome in their homes: she should ask herself
    these questions, and be completely honest when answering them: 1. does mother
    invite herself? (it''s natural to resent houseguests who come to visit when it''s
    convenient for them without considering their hosts.) 2. is mother critical of
    her married children and their spouses? (some mothers assume they have a right
    to criticize their children''s cooking, housekeeping, child-rearing, clothing,
    friends, habits, etc. they refuse to accept their children as the adults they
    are.) 3. is mother inflexible in her habits? (if she cannot tolerate changes in
    her daily routine, she should stay home. it''s unreasonable and rude to expect
    a whole family to alter its routines to accommodate her. by the way, this applies
    equally to children visiting their parents.) 4. does mother disappear once in
    a while to allow her children some private time together? please print this, abby.
    i want to send it to my mother-in-law. she also insists that she''s "really no
    trouble at all." if that were true, it wouldn''t take us weeks to get over one
    of her "short" visits: so, "perplexed mother"--clean up your act, and your children

    my mother died last year and left me her eastern star ring, which she hadproudly

    one day while shopping, i ran into a friend of mother''s in a shopping mall. we
    chatted a while, then she noticed my ring and asked if it was my mother''s. when
    i told her it was, she asked me to take it off so she could get a better look
    at it. i obliged. she proceeded to rant and rave about how i was blaspheming the
    eastern stars by wearing their ring when i was not a member. she said my mother
    should have been buried with that ring, and i had no right to wear it, and she
    was going to see that i was called before the council. then she stomped off with
    my ring! i was stunned. i went to the police and asked if this was a case of theft.
    they said, "most definitely," and advised me to swear out a warrant if i wanted
    the ring. i did as they advised and finally got the ring back, but now i''m on
    the eastern star''s blacklist and many of my mother''s friends refuse to speak

    i never thought i''d be writing to you, but all those letters about smoking and
    lung cancer have forced me to write. you probably won''t use this, but just ask
    yourself: how many smokers do you know? how many people do you know right now
    who have lung cancer? have you ever personally known anybody who died from lung
    cancer? i am willing to bet that you know many smokers, but cannot name one person
    who has lung cancer now, and have never personally known anyone who died from
    it. so, if it''s true that smoking causes lung cancer, isn''t it strange that
    so few people can come up with a single name? still smoking'

    when my son was 12 years old, a 19-year-old college girl had sex with him. (she

    i didn''t know about these experiences while they were going on. he is 16 now

    he has been spending a lot of time at the home of a 38-year-old divorced woman.

    "not exempt in phoenix" missed the point. the purpose of "child in car" signs
    is to alert rescuers in case of an accident to search for a child, since small
    children may easily be hidden under debris, or thrown into roadside bushes or
    ditches. the same rationale applies for signs on bedroom windows for the elderly,

    my girlfriend and i just had a heated argument over her new swimsuit. the top
    is ok, but the bottom consists of a string that goes around her waist--attached
    to a triangular piece of fabric that is no more than 4 inches wide in the front,
    and not much more in the back. the trouble started when we went to the beach and
    i saw "lisa" in her new swimsuit for the first time. i told her i thought it was
    too skimpy and no decent girl would go out in public like that. she said i was
    living in the dark ages, and proceeded to point out other girls in similar swimsuits.
    i told her i didn''t care if there were girls naked on the beach, as far as i
    was concerned, that didn''t make it right. i''m 24 and she''s 22 and we''re practically
    engaged, so i told her that wearing a swimsuit like that looks like she''s advertising
    her body and inviting the attentions of other men. (lisa does have a beautiful
    figure, and the men did look at her.) she told me she loves me and i''m a jerk

    several months ago you ran a column about a husband-to-be who asked if you thought

    our morning coffee group could not agree with your answer. two were for, one was
    against, and i was undecided. my loving, caring, nearly perfect husband of 48
    years passed away last month. he was a retired portrait photographer. as i went
    through his things in his at-home studio, i got the surprise of my life! he had
    in the back of his closet women''s lingerie, dresses, heels, makeup and wigs.
    i also found photographs which he had taken of himself dressed like a woman and
    looking beautiful. even in his most recent photographs his legs were gorgeous
    in a miniskirt, hose and 4-inch heels. he could have been a hosiery model. i found
    diaries which he had kept since long before he knew me, and, abby, he was not
    a homosexual--he just liked to get dressed up in women''s clothing! i regret that
    he was never able to share his fantasy with me while he was alive. he probably
    thought i would not have approved--or worse yet, that i would have thought he
    was some kind of freak. i have moved all his female attire into my dressing room
    closet where i can see them every day. maybe somehow he will know that i would
    have approved had he told me. widow in sun city, ariz. do you hate to write letters

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    in a recent column you suggested a portable cordless telephone for people who
    work in their yards a lot and rush back into the house to answer the phone but
    seem to get there too late. as one with 13 years of professional experience in
    electronics, i believe the public should be warned about the lack of privacy when
    using these devices. cordless telephones transmit conversations using shortwave
    radio signals. many users are under the false impression that because the unit
    operates only within a limited range, the signal travels no farther. not so. with
    a very cheap receiver, i have overheard conversations from cordless telephones
    from over a mile away, and this experience is not uncommon. another warning: certain
    types of cordless telephones are vulnerable to "hackers" who could electronically
    break into your telephone line and charge their toll calls to your bill. the public
    has a short memory. in 1972, the watergate burglars were caught trying to place
    a transmitter in the telephone of the political opposition. had cordless telephones
    been available at that time, they could have merely presented their target with
    one as a "gift," and listened to their heart''s content. raymond f. gawryla scranton,

    i totally agree with your objections to mandatory drug testing for everyone. i
    am in the military, and we take urinalysis tests at least once a month. since
    i have never used drugs and i never plan to, i was not afraid of these tests.
    that is until recently. abby, i am one of the unlucky 10 percent who have never
    used drugs but came up positive on the test for the use of marijuana, and you
    would not believe what i have been going through. i had planned to make the military
    my career, but my chances are ruined. i have lost the respect of my seniors in
    command and lost some of my so-called friends. my family and fiancee have been
    harassed. and i have been branded a liar. the military is very strict on drugs,
    and they should be. however, when innocent people are found "guilty" of something
    they never dreamed of doing, there is something wrong with the system. i came
    up positive in march. it''s now july, and i am still fighting the charge. i was
    told it would be resolved in six months. meanwhile, i am up for special courts-martial,
    and if convicted i will have a federal record and go to jail! they can take my
    rank, my pay and i will be discharged under less than honorable conditions. i
    was always proud to be a marine, but how can i be proud when i am terrified of
    losing everything i have worked for? heartsick in hawaii'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    denise salvaggio''s dream is to do for bugs what walt disney did for animals.
    more on that later. right now let''s talk about her telephone manner. with only
    the most perfunctory preface, this is how she responded to a request for an interview:
    "what a coincidence. at this very moment i''m writing a story for page 1a on a
    new breed of cockroach that''s invaded florida. the asian cockroach. this roach
    seems to be every floridian''s nightmare." in her cheery, gee-whiz drawl, and
    as if reading from a textbook, she continued, unprompted and uninterrupted. "unlike
    most roaches, it does not flee the room when you turn your lights on. in fact,
    it is attracted to lights and brightly colored surfaces. it also can live anywhere,
    indoors or out. it is not afraid of people. it looks a lot like the german cockroach
    and"--a frisson of terror is appropriate here--"breeds with it." then salvaggio
    laughed. it was a laugh that recognizes unfathomably huge absurdity. it was a
    laugh that convinces you that the extermination of humans from the planet will
    occur not with a nuclear pop but as a result of the invasion of an army of cross-breed
    bugs. it was a laugh that makes you wonder whether writing about bugs every week
    for almost four years hasn''t made salvaggio a little buggy. salvaggio''s weekly
    column for the orlando sentinel is succinctly called "bugs." accompanying each
    column is a black-and-white etching of the starring bug, captioned "bug-du-jour."
    "it''s no glamor beat," she modestly says. in booming florida, however, where
    bugs are as popular a topic as condos and cocaine, and cockroaches are the unofficial
    pet, her audience is ready-made and multiplying. salvaggio, 30, is a petite, auburn-haired,
    wide-eyed woman who, when asked what she does when she''s not writing about bugs,
    says simply, "i like shopping." she was a clerk in the sentinel''s features department
    when she was offered the chance to carve a journalistic niche for herself, a niche
    that in the whole wide journalistic world she apparently inhabits alone. "they
    wanted someone with a bizarre sense of humor," she says, "so naturally i came
    to mind immediately." when she started, salvaggio didn''t know anything about
    bugs, except the ones that shared her kitchen. she consulted a local horticulturist,
    who has become her guru, and she checked out all the books on bugs in the public
    library. "that came to three," she says. when she says that she wants to do for
    bugs what walt disney did for animals, she means that while providing useful information
    on insects she wants to make her readers able to relate to the yucky little pests
    as if they were just folks. where less imaginative people see only creepy, crawly
    critters that deserve to be swatted or squished, salvaggio sees heroes and villains
    and wild metaphors for the human condition. here is a typical "bugs" beginning:
    "old macdonald had a farm full of very verbal residents. when a moo-moo here and
    a cluck-cluck there competed with all the other animal vocalizations, a din comparable
    to that heard in times square on new year''s eve was undoubtedly produced." the
    unpracticed bugs reader might wonder what moo-moos and cluck-clucks have to do
    with bugs. patience. she''s getting to it. "with such a constant racket, one could
    imagine this celebrated farmer seeking some peace and quiet among the cornstalks
    in his fields. unfortunately, he would be able to achieve only the latter goal.
    while the crops may be silent, there''s plenty of insect activity going on beneath
    them that will surely undermine macdonald''s desperately desired serenity. case
    in point: the spotted cucumber beetle (family chrysomelidae)." here''s salvaggio
    on the house fly: "in the science-fiction movie the fly, a mishap during a molecular
    transportation experiment caused a scientist and house fly to switch heads. neither
    party was better for the exchange. "perhaps the only reason such a mix-up hasn''t
    occurred is that the technology for it doesn''t exist. nevertheless, the fictional
    fly of the film was just another example of a house fly (musca domestica linn)
    going someplace it wasn''t wanted." over the years, she has developed certain
    principles of bug writing. "as a rule," she says, "beetles are very interesting
    to do, but moths are very dull." though she has never taken a course in bug writing,
    salvaggio is not ignorant of journalistic principles. she knows a news peg when
    she sees one. for example, she wrote about the ox beetle the week of super bowl
    sunday, comparing it to a beefy fullback, a "bruiser of a bug" that can trample
    any insect opponent. she and her bugs occasionally ride the crest of a trend.
    she introduced the palm weevil this way: "thanks to the television detective series
    ''miami vice,'' florida has gained a reputation for glamor and intrigue. while
    savvy viewers realize the drama involves some amount of exaggeration, there''s
    no denying the sunshine state harbors its share of desperadoes--especial ly one
    six-legged variety known as the palm weevil (family curculionidae)." salvaggio
    is not only the aesop and the disney of the bug world, she is its dear abby, dispensing
    advice and consolation to the needy. "the column attracts weirdos," she says.
    "i got a phone call one day from a young man who spoke with a pronounced southern
    accent. he wanted to know what a particular insect was that he''d seen in his
    yard. it sounded like a whip scorpion. he said he''d been shooting at them with
    his bb gun. i told him they eat roaches and perhaps it wasn''t to his advantage
    to shoot them. apparently that''s what he did for amusement. shooting whip scorpions
    with a bb gun. you have to be really hard up for entertainment." readers often
    call seeking to identify bugs. some send samples. one reader mailed in a couple
    of cotton stainers taped to a sheet of paper. "dead, of course," says salvaggio.
    one day she arrived at work to find on her desk a jar wrapped in brown paper.
    the neighbor of one of her colleagues had sent it in for identification. "i tore
    off the paper and there was this huge, live lubber grasshopper weakly struggling
    to get out. the man thought he had killed it but he hadn''t. they''re about four
    inches long. so we are talking about something the size of a $3 pet. even though
    it''s very destructive to foliage i didn''t have the heart to kill it. i let it
    out in the parking lot." salvaggio''s columns frequently include tips on how to
    tame the bug-du- jour, in the house and out. "in the garden," she wrote after
    recommending an insecticide to thwart the palm weevil, "it''s necessary to take
    the law into your own hands." like a dorm mother or a teacher, salvaggio develops
    preferences among members of the bug community. her favorite is the lacewing.
    her voice lilts as she says the name. "it''s a very delicate insect who looks
    like tinkerbell would look if tinkerbell were an insect, like a flying piece of
    gossamer." in her column on the lacewing, salvaggio constructed a fairy tale in
    which the bug played a princess. the most despicable insect she has encountered
    is the palmetto bug. her lip curls in disgust. "when you come to florida and see
    this giant bug that looks like it could walk away with everything you own and
    somebody says it''s a palmetto bug, don''t be fooled. it''s not just a palmetto
    bug. it''s a cockroach." writing about bugs has changed her life even outside
    the newsroom. "i find i tend to gravitate toward bug-oriented items," she says.
    "i find that for holidays and birthdays i get a lot of bug-related jewelry. shopkeepers
    who know me will show me bug-shaped pins and necklaces when i go into their shops."
    among her recent acquisitions is a battery-operated spider from outer space. "it''s
    really amazing," she says. "the eyes light up. and it walks." salvaggio is asked
    how many bugs, discounting seasonal repeats such as the mole cricket and the tree
    hopper, she has written about. momentary panic flashes in her eyes. "all of them."
    then she corrects herself. no, no, not really. there are undoubtedly plenty more
    to go. she says she''ll keep writing about bugs as long as there are bugs in florida,
    which sounds like a guarantee of lifetime employment. "i''ll keep writing about
    them as long as somebody writes a letter saying, ''i found something in my yard.
    it has six legs and is covered with hair. what is it?"'' caption: photo: "they
    wanted someone with a bizarre sense of humor," explains denise salvaggio, writer
    of a weekly column about creepy- crawlies. photo by tom burton/the orlando sentinel.

    six plant-senders she''d like to "visit" starting next month. old people deserve

    remember me? i''m "katherine in georgetown, tex." i wrote to you last september
    saying that i wanted to donate my organs after death but couldn''t get any witnesses
    to sign the consent form. members of my family refused to sign it, fearing some
    doctor might get "scalpel happy" and remove the organs they need before i''m dead.
    i took the form to church five sundays in a row but couldn''t get anybody to sign
    it. (they said i might need all my parts at the resurrection.) even my own husband
    wouldn''t sign it! well, abby, you printed my letter, explaining that my husband
    needed to understand that willing one''s organs after death in order to improve
    the quality of life for the living is one of the most generous acts a person can
    perform. and the possibility that some "scalpel-happy" surgeon might remove one
    of my organs before i was dead was impossible because a patient must be pronounced
    dead by two doctors before a death certificate is signed. and as for "needing"
    all my organs for the resurrection, should a person return to live again in the
    body of his previous life, the good lord could be trusted to miraculously replace
    the missing parts. to make a long story short, when my family saw your explanation
    in the paper, they not only offered to witness my donor form, they became donors
    themselves! and listen to this, abby. last week i had major surgery, and when
    i gave my doctor my donor card to clip to my chart, he asked me what it was. he
    said he had never seen one before! so please print this and tell everybody who
    has a donor card to inform their doctors now, in case one day they''ll need emergency
    surgery and are in no condition to let the doctor know. thank you. katherine in

    this is in response to "call me nothing"--whose daughter-in- law never called
    her anything. twenty-nine years ago when i was a bride, i never called my mother-in-law
    anything either. although i loved her very much, i just couldn''t bring myself
    to call her "mother" or "mom" and i couldn''t address her by her first name. then
    one day she said to me, "i think it''s time you called me something. you know,
    even a dog has a name." i said, "yes, i know. may i call you ''fido''?" having
    no sense of humor, she said, "no, you may not--just call me marjorie." so i called
    her marjorie. i have three married children now, and their spouses all were told
    to call me anything they felt comfortable with. one calls me "mom," one calls
    me "eleanor," and the third one doesn''t call me anything yet. he''s only been
    in the family since june, so i''ll give him a little more time, and if he doesn''t
    call me something, i''ll suggest "fido." eleanor c. in omaha'

    i need your advice about a situation that arose a few days ago. my husband was
    married to a woman who had a 5-year-old son by a previous marriage. when the boy
    was 8, my husband adopted him. this adopted son died a few days ago. in the obituary
    of our local paper, my husband''s ex-wife stated that her deceased son was born
    to her and my husband on a certain date and in a specified city. (it was four
    years before my husband had even met this woman!) what was even more bizarre,
    my husband was not listed as one of the survivors. this woman has been married
    and divorced three times since she and my husband were divorced, but she always
    took back his surname. we''ve been married for 28 years. should my husband ignore
    this flagrant fabrication, or should we ask the newspaper to print a retraction?
    or is there a more appropriate solution to this situation? upset in enid, okla.'

    up the subject of breaking up with him again. right now i am so mad at him for

    yesterday while grocery shopping, i witnessed a young mother screaming at her

    frightened he couldn''t decide. instead of waiting, she grabbed him by his hair
    and whipped his head back! he started crying and fell to the floor. she reached
    down, pulled the little fellow to his feet, then slapped him as hard as she could
    and whipped his head back again. needless to say, the child ended up with nothing.
    i noticed that four or five other shoppers had witnessed this cruel scene and
    appeared as disgusted as i was. why didn''t one of us do something? a part of

    my granddaughter, "annette," 18, just graduated from high school. she was a straight-a
    student. she''s been accepted by the college of her choice for pre-med and plans
    to pursue a medical career. in filling out the form for a roommate, she wrote
    the following: "i would like very much to share my room with ''cecille,'' as we
    are close friends and have been cohabitating." i''m sure she didn''t mean for
    me to see it, but i am paying for her housing and the form was with the housing

    might think that she and cecille were lesbians. i received no answer. i don''t
    know whether she changed the wording on the form, but when her father reached
    for it, she grabbed it and informed him that it was "personal." abby, these two
    girls have been close friends through grammar and high school. annette has never

    your prayer for animals was very touching. animals do need our prayers, but they
    also need us to stop the cruel and barbaric practice of using live animals to
    test cosmetics, hair spray, drain cleaner, nail polish remover, etc. no anesthetic
    is used, and these laboratory animals suffer agonizing pain. dogs, rabbits, monkeys,
    cats, guinea pigs, mice and rats are used. for example: to test toxicity, animals
    are force-fed a substance such as drain cleaner, causing convulsions, paralysis
    and bleeding from the nose, eyes and mouth. another test measures the irritancy
    of products that might get into a person''s eyes: rabbits are placed in stocks
    to prevent them from clawing their eyes to dislodge the irritating substance.
    only their necks and heads protrude. the lower lid of the rabbit''s eye is pulled
    away from the eyeball to form a small cup. into that cup is dropped some of the
    substance to be tested. the eye is then held closed for several seconds while
    the animal screams in pain. the other eye is left untreated to serve as a "control."
    the rabbit''s eyes are then observed at specific intervals to see how severe the
    irritation is. is the lid swollen? the iris inflamed? did it cause blindness?
    alternatives to these tests do exist, but remain untried. i know this is a long
    letter on an unpleasant subject, but the public needs to know about it. there
    is a bill pending--it''s the humane product testing act (hr 1877). abby, please
    print this and urge your readers to let their elected representatives know that
    they want this bill passed. please be the voice of the voiceless. nanci unger,

    please print this in your column and title it, "a summer warning": last year,
    my good husband suggested that we rent a summer place at the shore where we could
    go to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. nice, right? wrong! he
    moved me and the children out there, promising to come down every friday to spend
    the weekend with us. well, i found myself at the shore, but my husband never came
    to be with us. every weekend he had a different excuse. his car was acting up.
    he was too tired to make the drive. he had some business meetings he couldn''t
    miss. someone he knew had died and he had to go to the funeral. he had to visit
    a sick friend in the hospital, and on and on. "poor baby," i thought. surprise,
    surprise! he had put me in a safe place, leaving him free to run around all summer.
    when i came home i found out that he had taken up with some floozie who i suspect
    he''s still seeing. he pleaded not guilty, but i had all the evidence i needed.
    no more r and r at the shore for me. if he can stand the summers in the city,
    so can i! sweating it out in the bronx confidential to having problems in tucson:

    are you ready for something trivial? a co-worker took me to task for failing to
    say, "god bless you," every time she sneezed. i told her i thought it was silly.
    why should sneezes be "blessed"? no other bodily noises evoke a blessing. not
    coughing, belching, hiccuping, etc. this friend makes a regular conversation out
    of a sneeze: "ah, choo!" "bless you." "thank you!" "you''re welcome." as far as
    i''m concerned, the sneezer should say, "excuse me for spreading germs." why did
    sneezes come to be blessed in the first place? no blesser in north carolina'

    can you please help an immigrant understand the americans? in south america, i
    was offended by the disdain of rich shoppers who picked through the baskets of
    produce offered by poor peasants. in england, i saw a sign over a bin of fruit
    placed there by the greengrocer lady: "please don''t pinch me until i''m yours!"
    (that seemed fair enough.) i am grossed out by people in the produce department
    pulling back the husks on corn, looking for i don''t know what. why can''t americans
    handle ears of corn without disfiguring them? who wants to buy another person''s
    rejects? it is easy to tell by just hefting it whether an ear is well-formed and
    substantial. if, after i buy it, i find a worm residing in the tip of the ear,
    i rejoice that the corn had not been sprayed with poison. i simply cut off the
    part with the worm, and eat the rest. so what do they expect to find when ripping
    nature''s package? it''s the same as peeling a banana in the supermarket to see
    whether it''s fit to buy. i don''t want to ascribe thoughtless manners to people
    who are otherwise polite and kindly. tell me, abby, why do they do it, and what
    are they looking for? puzzled in carmichael, calif.'

    people, will probably think i''m a nut case. i hear music or singing, or both.
    the same compositions over and over. my last attack was a duet with a mezzo and

    my daughter just hung up on me, and i need to run this by you to find out if you
    think i did the right thing. a little background: our daughter eloped last week
    with the man she''s been living with for 12 years. when they returned from their
    elopement, they called and asked her father and me to have dinner with them to
    celebrate. the other guests were the parents of the groom and another couple--their
    good friends who were their witnesses. we went to dinner with them and offered
    to pick up the tab, but they refused. just now this daughter called me to say
    that since we were spared the expense of a big wedding, she thinks it''s our duty
    to give them a wedding reception! she said they would select the time, the place,
    plan the menu, invite all the guests and all we would have to do was pay for it.
    i told her that if she wanted a reception she would have to pay for it --that
    i was not interested in inviting our family and friends to a wedding reception
    that was 12 years too late. that''s when she hung up on me. abby, this girl is
    39 years old. how do you feel about this? had enough in connecticut'

    i picked out because i came out looking so top-heavy, i hated myself. i couldn''t
    wait until my doctor redid the operation. disappointment no. 2: for some reason,
    he replaced the too-large implants with ones that were too small. i knew right
    away they weren''t what i ordered, so i had a third operation. this one has me
    looking lopsided. my left breast is about four inches higher than my right. when
    i told my doctor he would have to do it over again, he refused, saying, "i''m

    in the last two weeks, i''ve been to a concert, a movie, a protestant wedding

    church, where i found it necessary to pray fervently the entire time to keep from
    behaving in an uncharitable manner that would have been at odds with the very
    purpose of attending church. in each instance, i was seated near people who whispered,
    talked and giggled with an utter disregard for those around them. i protested
    once in the movies and once at a concert to the noisemakers who robbed me of my
    concentration. my complaints were rudely ignored. now, rather than complain, i
    have given up with the passive majority who find it impossible to deal with that
    kind of robbery. smokers who used to rob nonsmokers of clean air have been stopped

    i am a 14-year-old girl. i have a great family and i love them dearly. the thing
    i want most is to have my parents trust me. one incident made me feel i lost their
    trust completely. here it is: my parents went out one evening and told me i could
    have three friends over (my best girlfriend and two boys). i agreed to stay in
    the house with my guests. later when my friends arrived and my parents were gone,
    the incident happened. while my girlfriend and i were talking in my bedroom, the
    two boys got into my parents'' liquor cabinet. they were having some drinks when
    my parents walked in. dad handled it very well. he took me aside and said, "i
    think it''s time for your friends to leave." as i looked at my dad i could see
    on his face how very disappointed he was in me. i felt just awful! later we talked
    about what happened very briefly. the next weekend my parents had planned to go
    out of town, but they canceled the trip, saying, "we don''t think we can trust
    you to be by yourself." i quickly reminded them that it wasn''t me who got into
    the liquor cabinet. then they said (unconvincingly), "well, we can''t trust your
    friends, then." abby, why should my parents make me feel like they don''t trust
    me? it was my so-called friends they couldn''t trust. please tell moms and dads
    to trust their children until they prove to you that they can''t be trusted. trustworthy

    a member of our family is notoriously cheap. whenever there is a wedding or shower
    in the family, dolores (not her real name) says, "put my name on the card, and
    i''ll pay you later." with dolores "later" must mean "never" because she has yet
    to come up with any money. meanwhile, her name is on all the cards along with
    the rest of us who actually pay our fair share for the gifts. how should this
    be handled? reminding her hasn''t helped. she''s always a little short until next

    a year and a half ago i met my first love. i was 16 and he was 17. in the beginning
    everything was fine. then he started to slap me around. since he was my first
    love, i thought i couldn''t live without him, so i just took it and said nothing.
    this went on for about a year, then i found out that he was having sex with another
    girl, too. it tore me apart, but i told him that i wanted no more to do with him
    and he should leave me alone. he said he would leave me alone if i would have
    sex with him one more time for old times'' sake. i said no, i didn''t want him
    to even touch me. then before i knew what was happening, he pinned me down and
    raped me! when i told my mother about it, she said i wasn''t raped; it was my
    fault for having a sexual relationship with him in the first place. abby, i thought
    i was in love. i never dreamed that he would do something like that. i still don''t
    understand my mother''s reasoning. i am asking you, was what happened really my
    fault? or was i raped? brokenhearted'

    i am writing for an opinion only. i do not intend to say or do anything. besides,
    you will probably tell us to mind our own business, but we all feel so sorry for
    this poor lady i''ll call agnes. this is the situation: i work in a public school
    administration office with agnes, a lovely woman who is the secretary for two
    administrators, which in itself is a heavy workload. however, one of the administrators
    brings her two children to work for agnes to take care of. agnes has been asked
    to take these children to their swimming lessons, etc., and if she''s not chauffeuring
    them somewhere, they are either in her office or going up and down the halls.
    they are not here every day, but they have been here two and three times a week
    since summer began. i have to send my children to day care, as do all the other
    secretaries who work here, and we don''t make nearly as much as administrators.
    don''t you think agnes is being taken advantage of? and isn''t the administrator''s
    behavior in poor taste? sorry for agnes'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    dr. robert l. dupont, president of the center for behavioral medicine in rockville,
    md., insists that everyone who tests positive for drugs in a urine testing program
    is guilty. this is utter nonsense. for example, the navy has issued an elaborate
    regulation to ensure safeguards in the collection and subsequent handling of urine
    specimens. in dealing with several hundred navy urinalysis cases, i have never
    yet seen a single case in which that regulation was not violated. as a result,
    specimens are often mislabeled, contaminated or lost before they ever reach the
    laboratory. we have been able to prove, repeatedly, that a urine specimen attributed
    to our client was in fact someone else''s. if this occurs in the navy, where the
    service member is protected by the right to counsel, what will happen in private
    industry where there are no such protections? furthermore, once the specimen reaches
    the laboratory it is subject to error in testing. even the manufacturers of the
    testing equipment concede some margin of error, as does dr. dupont. he maintains,
    however, that because the margin of error is small, it is statistically "irrelevant."
    as he should know, statistical inference has no validity in the individual case,
    and in the american system of justice, civilian or military, an accused person
    is not supposed to be convicted, or punished, on the basis of statistical inference,
    but rather on the basis of individual guilt, proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
    no responsible person advocates the use of dangerous drugs or alcohol in the workplace.
    but we should not permit careers, lives and families to be destroyed by programs
    as rife with error as the urine testing programs. in this country, we believe
    in the rule of fundamental fairness. apparently, dr. dupont does not. charles

    i read the letter from the young woman who lost all her hair permanently due to
    a condition called alopecia. i also was surprised to learn there was an organization
    that gives help and support to such people. that woman should know that not all
    men would find her unattractive when she removes her wig. there are men who think
    bald women beautiful! i am one. i am a male, late 20s, normal in every way, and
    for some reason i find bald women attractive. so far my search for my dream girl
    has been unsuccessful, but i really would like to marry a girl who would keep
    her head shaved perfectly smooth. since few would agree to do this (even if she''d
    agree to shave it once, she''d probably wind up growing it back sooner or later),
    i would love to meet a permanently bald woman with a pretty face and warm smile.
    remember, beauty is in the beholder''s eye, and just because society set one standard
    of what is beautiful does not mean everyone has to conform to it. so, if any of
    you bald girls out there go shopping, or just out for a walk--leave your wig at
    home. how else are men like me going to know you have no hair? of course, not
    all women look good bald, but if her face is pretty, and she has a nice smile,
    expressive eyes, and ears that don''t stick out, she''s my idea of a beauty. bald

    been away "camping." the other boy, however, received a different punishment.
    he had a history of causing trouble at school, so his father suggested (and the

    police, and two police officers came to the school and told the boy he was under

  body: 'dear ms. van buren: you really are a funny little old lady. both you and
    "disillusioned," who lost her cool when her husband "violated her privacy" by
    looking through her purse, must have conveniently short memories, or else you''ve
    never lived in the real world with the rest of us. from the year one, women have
    gone through men''s pockets and wallets looking for something they hope will give
    them yet another reason to nag. and in the past two decades, women in general
    have been on a crusade to invade every aspect of men''s privacy, from his pockets
    to his private club. you broads go out of the house wearing fake faces and other
    kinds of fakery, and yet you have the utter gall to talk about "deception." sometimes
    a man might get curious as to what''s under all the sham. does she carry it all
    in her purse? it''s big enough! stanley w. haynes, bothell, wash.'

    i have read your column for years, but i cannot believe that i am writing to you.
    i am a middle-aged wife and mother. i work full time at a job that i like. i am
    active in church and community work and have many friends. i am faced with a situation
    so bleak that i am overcome with depression. my only child will be leaving for
    college soon. my favorite aunt is fighting a losing battle with cancer. my mother
    and husband are both in poor health. my pets are elderly, and i know their days
    are numbered. i know there is nothing you can do, but just unloading my feelings
    helps. we live in a small town and counseling is not available. the only source
    of help is prayer, and sometimes my faith grows weak and i become so depressed
    that even prayer doesn''t help. i am fine all day while i''m at work, but when
    i go home, depression sets in. how do others handle the loss of their children
    when they leave home? thank you for listening. depressed'

    help me before i kill my husband. he insists on doing the laundry and it drives

    even gone as far as making a sign in big letters to hang above my machine saying,
    "do not wash!" he ignores it. he says i don''t appreciate his help, so i tried
    to explain that there is more to doing laundry than just throwing everything into
    the machine with soap, and then into the dryer. i like to sort out the wash. i
    like to soak out stains first. i like to fold the clothes as soon as the dryer
    stops. not him. if a sock is in a ball, it''s washed in a ball. if there are stains
    on a shirt, it''s washed and dried with the stains--making them harder to get
    out. he washes tea towels with underwear! i just can''t stand it anymore. he''s

    fifteen months ago, when i learned that my husband was hooked on cocaine, i was
    stunned! i have never used drugs in my life and wasn''t aware of the signs. i
    only knew that he was broke all the time, but i didn''t know why. i found out
    later that my best friend, "lori," got my husband started on cocaine, and was
    also his supplier. i felt heartsick, angry and betrayed. it took a lot of love,
    patience and counseling to keep my marriage together, but i did it. i broke off
    all contact with lori, but now she calls me at work and at home, begging me to
    forgive her and renew our friendship. i keep telling her i want nothing to do
    with her, but she comes to my place of work and keeps begging me. if she would
    clean up her act, i might reconsider, but, abby, she still uses drugs and insists
    that she''s not addicted. am i wrong to distance myself from her? if not, how

    i was moved to write when i read the young girl''s complaint about her mother''s
    secondhand smoke. i want to tell you how proud i am of my own mother. she used
    to smoke, though i have no memories of it--only photographs of a pretty young
    mother holding a baby (me) in one hand and a cigarette in the other. she was 32
    years old at the time. when the reports first came out stating that smoking was
    unhealthy, she quit--cold turkey. others have told me she climbed the walls for
    a couple of months, and it was years before the craving left her. she did it for
    me and my sisters. she didn''t want us to follow her poor example and become smokers
    who would find it as hard to quit as it was for her. what have i (and my sisters)
    gained? we have never smoked. or wanted to. i grew up in a home free of burn marks,
    smelly draperies and nasty ashtrays. and when mom baby-sat for my children, i
    didn''t have to worry that they might find matches or a lighter in her purse.
    mom is still around, though we live thousands of miles apart. her letters have
    no scorch marks on them, and when we talk on the phone, i don''t have to listen
    to a hacking cigarette cough. thank you, mom, for having quit the habit when i
    was a baby. it took guts, courage and caring. betty diemert''s daughter'

    i''ve been happily married for 10 years and have two children. i found out last

    100 percent faithful to him; in fact, i was a virgin when we married. i thought
    we had a good marriage until he started acting strange around me, then i knew
    something was bothering him. i finally wormed the reason out of him. i asked for
    all the details because i felt i had a right to know. he said a girl he works
    with came on to him, so he took her to a club, had a drink or two, then went to
    her apartment where the incident took place. he said he was not drunk, and knew
    what he was doing, but nothing really happened--he never completed the act because
    right in the middle of it he felt so guilty he wasn''t able to! i believe him,
    but i want to know if you would call this an "affair." technically, the act wasn''t
    completed, but it wasn''t as though he stopped in the middle because he felt guilty.
    he stopped because he couldn''t complete the act. (am i making myself clear?)

    my world is about to fall apart. i''m 68 and "george" is 70. we both lost our

    but has moved back "home" with a girlfriend to look after her father and run his
    house. "stella" is spoiled rotten and bosses her father around as though he were

    43 years, and now this daughter is taking up where her mother left off. george
    will not stand up for himself, hoping the situation will solve itself. he doesn''t
    want stella to know that he bought me a new car and a lovely piece of jewelry
    as a wedding gift. he told her i already had them. i don''t like all this deceit.
    we have been married for seven months, and we are not even living together because
    his daughter is there and he says it will be too crowded with me there, too. abby,

    women on first aid: "what would you do if your husband suddenly collapsed with
    a heart attack, and was laid out on the floor just staring at you?" nearly all
    the wives came to the same conclusion. they said it would be so traumatic and
    unnerving that they would first have a glass of tea, then finish the lemon meringue
    pie, then spring to action and try to revive the husband. if they failed, they
    would call for help. we husbands concluded from this that when a man reaches the
    age of 65, he should immediately divorce his wife and marry a nurse who doesn''t
    care for lemon meringue pie. what do you think? bromal auerbach deborah hospital

    first, let me say that i love my daughter-in-law as i would my own daughter. now

    teapot, cream pitcher, sugar bowl, tray, etc. over the years, it has become tarnished.
    i doubt if it has ever been polished. it is out in the open, and i cringe every
    time i go to their home and see that lovely set so badly tarnished. i do not want
    to tell my son privately to tell his wife to polish it. she is a good homemaker,
    and we get along beautifully, and i want to keep it that way; however, this oversight

    all this talk we''re hearing about passing bills to ban homosexuals from housing

    this has been a problem for me. i''m 38, and for the last 12 years, i''ve shared
    a home with another woman. i am not gay and neither is she, but society has automatically
    labeled us "lesbians" because neither of us has ever been married and we have
    lived together for so long. this woman and i have no obligations or commitments
    to each other. if i could find a man with whom i could have the same arrangement,
    i wouldn''t mind living with him. it would be more acceptable in our society for
    me to live with a man than a woman. abby, if any kind of measures are to be taken
    against homosexuals, will all married people be excluded? what about married folks
    who get their little kicks on the side with people of their own sex? will sanctions
    apply only to those who admit they are gay, and exclude those who remain in the
    closet? what about those of us who are not gay, but are assumed to be because
    of our lifestyle? i''ve often wondered if there are other single straight people

    will you please add this to your collection of letters complaining about the misuse
    of the english language? this is not a grammatical error, it''s a moral one. i
    would like to begin a campaign against the use of the expression "killing two
    birds with one stone." abby, why would anybody want to kill even one bird with
    a stone? i can hear the retort: "but it''s only a figure of speech." that''s not
    true. i''m a great believer in the theory that language reflects our values, so
    if we nonchalantly talk about killing two birds, how far are we from actually
    doing it? couldn''t we just say, "do two things at the same time"? it means the
    same thing. as a bird lover, i find that expression very offensive. thanks for
    providing a forum for us complainers. a bleeding heart liberal vegetarian'

    why all this commotion about being too fat or too thin? ten or even 20 pounds
    one way or the other shouldn''t make that much difference. it seems foolish to
    worry, even for reasons of health. there are no guarantees how long we''ll endure
    in spite of determined efforts to keep fit. perhaps it''s just as well that we
    don''t know when we are going to be physically challenged. i am 60 pounds underweight
    due to a terminal illness. when i was healthy, i was a beautiful, shapely, well-proportioned
    young woman with extraordinary legs that caused men to walk into parking meters.
    at first i was devastated to consider that people would react with horror on seeing
    my skinny, bony legs. actually no one noticed. i keep repeating a quotation of
    unknown origin that i would like to share: each day is made special by what we
    can give it by how we accept it then how we live in it. accepting it'

    i read with interest any and all articles i can find about abused wives and children.
    i''ve read literally hundreds of them, and they all have one thing in common,
    a total disregard for the other party involved --namely, the abuser. men who physically
    abuse their families are in dire need of help and support. the abused wife and
    kids have shelters, financial support, counseling, support groups and sympathy.
    what does the abuser have? nothing but public scorn. he is made to feel ashamed,
    hated and less than human. he is locked up and kept away from his family. how
    do i know how an abuser feels? i am one. for three years i beat on my wife, but
    never without provocation. i never enjoyed hitting her, but i couldn''t help myself.
    afterward, i felt sick to my stomach. i need as much help as my wife, but there
    is no help for me. we are now separated and a divorce is pending. i love her and
    i love my kids, but i have lost them because of a few violent attacks on them.

    know i need it real bad. hurting in fresno'

    him could not be "lost" or stolen. they were something he needed and wanted more

    i have never written to you before, and do so now only because of recent developments

    in general, the media applauded this action, yet i am having a terrible time justifying
    such action on the part of the children. it seems such a short time ago that the
    media brought to our attention a similar action by chinese children. i recall
    thinking how terrible it would be to have our children violate the sanctity of

    called my father, repeated our conversation, and told him that i had given him

    a few weeks ago my wife and i had dinner out. in the cocktail lounge we were served
    by a pleasant young lady who was well along in her pregnancy. then in the dining

    children are important--to be loved and cherished--but being served by two pregnant

    i have a mother-in-law problem. when "joe" and i announced our engagement, his
    mother gave us a down comforter. it wasn''t a new one; it was one she had had
    for a long time that belonged to her mother. my own mother gave us a brand-new
    down comforter, not knowing that i had already received one. joe and i have been
    married a year and we''re using the comforter we got from my mother. my mother-in-law

    i am writing because i would like to know if you think that a 29-year-old female
    virgin is necessarily a freak. i''ve always felt that sex and love go together,
    but i''ve never been in love, nor have i ever had sex. getting close to someone
    has always been a problem for me and i''m working on this in therapy, but i feel
    like a misfit. although i am a successful physician, this problem really shakes
    my self- confidence. i put on a good facade, but i don''t feel like an adult,
    and i am afraid my colleagues and patients can see through me. it would take only
    one night to solve my problem, but the idea of forcing myself to have sex with
    someone breaks my heart, and i''m not sure i could go through with it. i''m trying
    to keep up my courage, but it''s an endless cycle of feeling different, getting
    more withdrawn and feeling more different than ever. i cry when i see happy couples
    in the park or a baby in a tv commercial. are there others out there like me?

    i was recently playing cards at the home of a new friend when her preteen children
    came home from school. she called them into the room and introduced them this
    way: "i''d like you to meet my son, andrew. and this is my stepson, johnny." i
    felt a little sorry for the stepson. might it not have been kinder to have introduced
    them both as "sons"? i was reminded of a relative who always made it a point to
    tell people on first meeting that sharon and natalie were her whole sisters, but
    jennifer was her half-sister. i had another relative who, believe it or not, would
    say in the presence of her children, "tommy is our own child, but jimmy is adopted."

    i am a 17-year-old guy with an important question. why are your readers so hung
    up on sex? i like your column, but it seems that one- third of your letters are
    about sex. personally, i think bowling is a lot more fun. judging from the few
    times i''ve had sex, i thought it would get more enjoyable, but it didn''t. unfortunately,
    high school peer pressure about this overrated activitiy is still with us. "who
    did you score with?" is still a hot topic at school. i think sex is boring. besides,
    with aids to worry about, it''s not worth the risk. also, the world already has
    more people than it can feed. give us more letters about people who are too fat,
    too tall, too short or were born on christmas. or hassles with the phone company,

    now that school has resumed, as a high school teacher, may i make a few suggestions
    that would greatly improve our nation''s educational system and cost the taxpayers
    nothing? make school attendance a top priority! a message to students: stop skipping
    school because you don''t want to face a challenging day. accept those challenges
    and do your best. your whole life will be filled with challenges, so learn to
    deal with them now--one day at a time. a message to parents: stop letting your
    children skip school to go shopping, to go hunting, to sleep in, to go on a family
    vacation, to nurse a minor ache, or whatever. it''s your responsibility to see
    that your children get eight hours of sleep each night, eat nutritious meals (especially
    breakfast) and get to school on time. a message to business people: stop hiring
    students to work during school hours. and please stop hiring teenage students
    to work after 8 p.m. on evenings before a school day. they need time to study
    and get a good night''s sleep for school the next day. a message to doctors, dentists,
    counselors and social workers: please stop pulling students out of classes for
    non-emergencies to accommodate your schedules. most students are dismissed at
    2:45 p.m., so please give them late- afternoon appointments. their education is
    as important to them as the schedules of adult patients and clients are to professionals.
    abby, recent studies show that we are a nation at risk. in the last 10 to 15 years,
    the quality of our education has deteriorated dramatically. an appalling number
    of our high school students are certified illiterates, and absenteeism is one
    of the main causes. students who do not attend classes cannot be taught. small-town

    before the furor dies down on nursing homes (granted there are many good ones
    but, unfortunately, a few rotten apples have soured the whole barrel), i submit
    the following: i was a very close friend of a poor, itinerant preacher. he became
    very ill, and toward the end he was placed in a prestigious nursing home by some
    well-to-do friends. in his dotage he asked for a wedding ring and a parker pen.
    to satisfy his whims, i brought him both, neither of which i bought at the five-and-ten.
    the next time i visited him, both items had mysteriously disappeared. i promptly
    replaced them. the replacements also disappeared. i complained to the staff. nobody
    knew anything. later, my husband was dying in an expensive religious-oriented
    hospital. at the end he was comatose, but he clutched a small golden crucifix,
    a small red and gold bible, and a suede-bound book--the "rubaiyat of omar khayyam"--
    all family heirlooms that i had brought him when he could respond only by touching
    something familiar and precious. when he died, i went into shock but returned
    to his room a short time later. the family heirlooms were not there. tell me,
    abby, who would steal a golden crucifix from a dying man or a wedding ring and
    pen from a broken-down preacher? i know times have changed, but i''m not banking
    on it, and if i ever check into a nursing home, i''ll take nothing with me except
    my dentures, a ballpoint pen and a gideon bible. stunned in the bible belt'

    with anybody else). i was worried because her ex- boyfriend lives there and they

    she said shewas sorry it happened, she couldn''t help it, and she begged me to
    forgive her. i forgave her, but i did a dumb thing and asked her who was the better
    lover--him or me. at first she said she didn''t know. then she said if she could
    combine the two of us, we would make the perfect lover! now she''s planning to

    i have been wanting to say this for a long time: my wife and i adopted a child
    years ago, and since then i''ve become fed up with the so- called "rights" of
    biological parents and the so-called "rights" of adopted children. what about
    the rights of parents who adopted that child? in recent years i have seen numerous
    tv shows, articles and letters in your column pushing for the "rights" of everyone
    involved in an adoption --except the adoptive parents. remember us? we''re the
    ones who sent our pictures and letters stating our qualifications for parenthood
    to over 100 doctors, lawyers, adoption agencies and hospitals begging for a child.
    we''re the ones who waited seven years for one of those contacts to pay off. and
    when it finally did, we''re the ones who loved this child with all our hearts.
    this child is ours! abby, i am not one of those jerks who believe that most children
    are given up for selfish reasons. i know that they were given up because their
    birth parents wanted what was best for their child. nevertheless, when they gave
    up that child, they also gave up their right to contact that child. finally, abby,
    i''m not going to prevent my child from finding her biological parents, if that''s
    what she wants to do when she''s of legal age. on the contrary, i''ve kept records
    in my safe-deposit box that will help her locate the birth parents. but in the
    meantime, if anyone tries to interfere with my family and our lives, he will need
    a lot more than a handful of so- called "rights"! determined in l.a.'

    my husband and i agree that trick or treat should be abolished. when our children
    were small, we followed the crowd and went along with it. when they came home
    after touring the neighborhood, there would be squabbles over which sibling had
    the better "haul." much of what they brought home gathered dust until christmas.
    then it was thrown out. each year halloween grew increasingly repugnant to us.
    as you say, "it''s legalized blackmail" -- a poor concept to instill in children.
    finally after several years of dreading oct. 31, i thought, "why should i go against
    my principles to follow the sheep?" so, instead, on halloween we took our children
    to a restaurant for a festive dinner. they never felt deprived, and i hope they
    respect us for holding out against a bad custom. it''s a shame more parents don''t
    put down a firm foot and behave like responsible guardians. mother of six'

    by nature, i''m a very courteous person, but how far should a person go in observing
    the rules of courtesy? my husband is retired but does part-time work. when he''s
    not working, he leaves the house anyway to spend the day with one of his young
    girlfriends. (saturdays and sundays, too.) he''s sometimes gone for two or three
    days "fishing." although this hurts me deeply, i''ve come to realize that this
    is the lot of many older women, so i take it in my stride. i become enraged when
    a female voice calls our home and says, "may i speak to your husband?" i feel
    like ripping the phone out, or telling her to go to h---, and slamming down the
    receiver! but instead, i politely say, "one moment, please. i''ll get him." then
    i dutifully call my husband to the phone. one of these days i''ll probably blow
    my stack. breaking.'

    months later bonnie called to say she had changed her mind and was flying out

    what is the proper way to ask a woman what she does all day? i mean in a party
    setting, when you have just met and don''t know anything about her. it would help
    to know if she''s a working woman, or stays home raising a family. or should this
    question be avoided? the conversation can just die if you don''t have some information

    recently my hairdresser had a birthday. she received many cards with checks, which
    she displayed so her customers could not miss seeing them. (i had given her a
    nice card without a check.) i took her display as a hint for clients who may have
    forgotten, or didn''t know it was her birthday. since then i noticed a definite
    coolness toward me. it started me to thinking: why should hairdressers always
    be on the receiving end of the goodies? what do their clients get besides a raise
    in prices and a lot of waiting while they work in extra customers on the regulars''
    time? a really smart hairdresser would keep track of her customers'' birthdays
    and give each one a complimentary shampoo and set, then when her birthday came
    around, all her clients would reciprocate with a nice check or gift that would
    more than equal the price of a shampoo and set. if you use this, sign me . . .

    i read with great interest your letter regarding the policy of banks in washington
    state concerning "dormant" accounts. they''re lucky. here in texas, an inactive
    account is considered "dormant" after three years. then the bank makes no effort
    to notify the customer either by phone or mail. my two children''s savings accounts
    were declared dormant by a local bank, and the first notice i had of it was when
    i received the quarterly bank statements showing a zero balance. when i asked
    the people at the bank if an error had been made, they said "no," and explained
    that the money had been sent to the state--that they did not have time to try
    to contact people and that they just published a list of names in the local newspaper
    in hopes that we would see our name there. they gave me a form to fill out and
    send to the state to reclaim the money. it was a typical government form--long
    and very tedious. i told them that i felt that it was their responsibility to
    do this since they had not made any effort to contact me. the least they could
    have done was to have a message printed at the bottom of my children''s statements
    the previous quarter telling me what was going to happen if some activity was
    not generated in the accounts. apparently the state does not want people contacted.
    a banker friend of mine says that this practice puts millions of dollars into
    the state treasury. get my drift? j.w. (tricked in texas)'

  body: 'dear readers: tomorrow will mark the 10th annual great american smokeout,
    an upbeat, good-humored, one-day campaign to encourage smokers to quit smoking
    for 24 hours--just to prove they can do it. the idea was conceived by the american
    cancer society, which insists that anyone who can live without a cigarette for
    24 hours can quit forever. so, if you''re hooked on cigarettes (or cigars) and
    you really want to quit, why not start thursday. the following information may
    motivate you: according to john f. banzhaf iii, executive director of ash (action
    on smoking and health) in washington, lung cancer is the single largest contributor
    to the total cancer death rate. it accounts for 25 percent of all cancer deaths
    in the united states. it is estimated that 85 percent of all lung cancer cases
    are due to cigarette smoking. as a smoker, you are 10 times more likely to die
    of lung cancer than a non-smoker. this year there will be 100,000 lung cancer
    cases among men and 49,000 among women. of these, 89,000 men and 41,000 women
    will die of the disease. the number of women who will die of lung cancer is increasing
    at an alarming rate. breast cancer used to be the biggest killer for women--now
    it''s lung cancer! a word about smoking-related diseases--emphysema, chronic bronchitis
    and heart disease. this year an estimated 350,000 will die from one of these.
    this total exceeds the number of u.s. deaths in world war ii; it is eight times
    as many people as die in automobile accidents. what about "secondhand" smoke?
    is it actually damaging to non-smokers? yes. furthermore, studies reveal that
    the children of smokers are more prone to lung problems and allergies than children
    of non-smokers. i have begged my young readers, "if you smoke, quit now. if you
    don''t smoke, don''t start!" yet an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 kids light up for
    the first time every day. why? peer pressure, no doubt. "how about the rights
    of smokers?" you ask. of course they are entitled to smoke. but they will have
    to find a place where they can smoke to their hearts'' content without offending
    those who can''t tolerate it. "quitting cold turkey" is the hardest way to quit,
    but my readers have told me it''s the most effective, and in the long run, the
    easiest way. cutting down is less traumatic, but the temptation to smoke is often
    too powerful to resist while smoking just one, two or three cigarettes a day.
    so, if you''ve been telling yourself, "one of these days i''m going to quit,"
    why not start tomorrow--just for 24 hours? p.s. a favor, please? if you quit tomorrow
    even for 24 hours, i want to hear from you. then write again and let me know how
    long you were able to stay clean. good luck. keep me posted. i care.'

    IN FACT, A FEW WHITE LIES MAY HELP.
  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth may do more harm than good
    to relationships, a university of southern california study says. white lies,
    those seemingly harmless misconstructions of fact, actually may do more good for
    a relationship than a steady onslaught of honesty, said dr. kenneth sereno, chairman
    of communications arts and sciences at the usc college of letters, arts and sciences.
    "how can you be sensitive, thoughtful and caring if you just blurt out what''s
    on your mind all the time?" sereno said. "the general body of research shows that
    in a marriage you have to have basic honesty," sereno said. "if you don''t have
    that you won''t have a good relationship. "the question is how much honesty."
    sereno conducted a yearlong study of couples--married and unmarried--to determine
    how much the truth hurts or helps relationships. the study found that the "let-it-all-hang-out"
    credo of the 1960s may not fly in the 1980s. "there''s an assumption that came
    out of the 1960s that the best kind of relationship is one in which people are
    truthful and honest with one another," sereno said. "not too long after these
    ideals came out, people realized what people were really like. now they are beginning
    to think it isn''t all that great to be totally honest all the time." sereno and
    graduate student melanie rich interviewed 148 married or otherwise cohabitating
    faculty members and students at several california colleges. after determining
    the amount of self-disclosure in relationships, sereno then attempted to gauge
    the degree of satisfaction couples enjoyed in their relationships. according to
    the study, satisfied couples tended to spend more time sharing their hopes and
    dreams with one another. unhappy couples said most of their discussions centered
    on fears, anxieties and character flaws. moreover, the study found that couples
    who could communicate in a polite manner tended to get more satisfaction from
    their relationship. as for the truth, sereno said, a little bit can go a long
    way in day-to- day life. "we''re not saying self-disclosure isn''t relative in
    a relationship. we''re probably saying that on a day-to-day basis, this heavy
    total honest communication is probably not what people ought to be doing," he
    said. on a daily basis, where seemingly innocent questions can spark an intense
    --and usually unwanted--probe of one''s innermost feelings, too much truth can
    be destructive, sereno said. "no one wants to go home every day after working
    hard and have an intense conversation about the kind of relationship they have
    and the kind of person they are," sereno said. "most of the time, it''s best to
    say ''fine'' if your spouse asks how you are, then just relax and eat dinner."
    but when a health or financial crisis arises, full disclosure of the truth is
    the best approach, sereno said. "concealing how one feels or what one thinks can
    cause serious problems," he said. "when these things happen that''s when people

    how, for example, does the full truth come into play when an affair is discovered
    during a marriage or otherwise committed relationship? "if one of the parties
    finds out, then both parties have to be totally honest," sereno said. "if one
    doesn''t find out, i''d read ''dear abby'' and see what she says." --'

  body: 'dear readers: i recently published a letter from "birmingham," who wrote
    to say that while she was at the home of a new friend, the children came home
    from school and the mother introduced them this way: "i''d like you to meet my
    son, andrew. and this is my stepson, johnny." "birmingham" wrote: "might it not
    have been kinder to have introduced them both as ''sons''?" then she ("birmingham")
    remarked that she had a relative who always made it a point to tell people on
    first meetings that sharon and natalie were her whole sisters, but jennifer was
    her half-sister. she added, "another relative, believe it or not, would say in
    the presence of her children, ''tommy is our own child, but jimmy is adopted.''
    " "birmingham" asked me to comment. i did, as follows: "in making a casual introduction,
    any mention of "step," "half," "own" or "adopted" strikes me as insensitive and
    uncalled for. should a closer friendship develop, the specific relationship will
    probably be disclosed in due time. but until and unless it does, to make a point
    of it is both tasteless and inappropriate." that seemed to be a reasonable and
    proper comment, right? wrong! read on for a few of many critical letters:'

    i am the stepmother of two wonderful children who have lived with my husband and
    me for more than five years. the children''s mother lives in the same town in
    which we live. when introducing the children, i state that they are my stepchildren.
    not only would their mother have corrected me for calling them my "children,"
    but the children would have corrected me. (and they have!) so, you think the introduction
    of stepchildren as such is "tasteless and inappropriate"? well, you haven''t had
    a 12- and 14-year-old correct you in front of a stranger. abby, give us mothers
    a break! the "wicked stepmother" in hobbs, n.m.'

    fifteen months ago, i took my two children and left my husband of 10 years. for
    nine years i took an emotional battering from this man until i finally reached
    the point of "let me out, or lock me up!" we live in the same city with my entire
    family. they have seen how abusive he has been to me and my children, yet they
    continue to invite him to all family functions--birthdays, anniversaries and holidays--just
    as though nothing had happened. i have hinted that i''m very uncomfortable with
    him there, but they continue to invite him. with the holidays approaching soon,
    i dread seeing him wined and dined by my family, who know how rotten he has been
    to me and my children. i hate to stay away from family gatherings, but i am miserable
    when he''s around acting extra charming so they will wonder what is wrong with
    me. i may have to ask my family to make a choice between him and me. what do you
    think? torn'

    you nominated the word "hors d''oeuvre" as the word most frequently misspelled.
    after grading tens of thousands of essays in the last 17 years, i have found that
    the most frequently misspelled commonly used word is "occurrence." amazingly,
    fewer than 10 percent of the students in my classes have spelled it correctly
    the first time. the most common misspelling of occurrence is "occurance"--but
    there are several others. i consider the most difficult word to spell for one
    who has not heard it before to be "chthonic" (pertaining to the gods of the underworld).
    whoever would expect the "ch" to be silent? mark graham, english department, arvada
    senior high, arvada, colo.'

    fifteen years ago, when i was 43 and pregnant with my seventh child, i found some
    pictures of a pretty young girl in my husband''s wallet. steve swore he didn''t
    know how they got there, but i''m not stupid. i had enlargements made and hung
    them all over the house. my kids thought i was nuts, and steve and i have been
    fighting ever since. last year i had a tap put on our phone and i learned plenty.
    steve and this girl, jill, have been seeing each other for 15 years and they have
    a 9- year-old son together. jill''s married and has two sons with her own husband.
    steve and i own our business and if it weren''t for me we wouldn''t have anything.
    he can hardly read and write, and he needs me to do all the paperwork. i called
    up jill''s husband and told him everything. he couldn''t believe it. he said jill
    was a perfect wife and mother. and get this--she never misses a sunday at church!
    i called her minister and told him all about her, and all he said was, "if she
    were perfect she wouldn''t need to go to church." to make a long story short,
    jill''s husband is giving her a divorce because (as he told me) after 15 years,
    steve and jill must really love each other, and he wants her to be happy. he told
    me i ought to do the same for steve. i said, "over my dead body." abby, i hate
    my husband and want to make his life miserable. what should i do? hurting bad'

    i enjoyed your column on whether gentlemen really do prefer blonds, but what''s
    the big deal about being a blond? anyone who wants to be a blond can be one in
    a couple of hours. i am a 66-year-old widower, having recently lost my wife of
    40 years, and if you were to ask me my preference, i would say, "give me a woman
    about my age with naturally gray hair." she lets me know that she does not feel
    the need to camouflage her real self. she''s self-confident, mature and not ashamed
    to admit to the world that she''s old enough to have gray hair. she''s an honest
