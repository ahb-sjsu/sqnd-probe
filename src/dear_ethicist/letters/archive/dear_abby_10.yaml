    i am very concerned with what parents give their young children to eat. i read
    a disturbing article in your column years ago about a child swallowing a marshmallow
    whole, and how it blocked the child''s airway. the child survived, but suffered
    permanent brain damage. could you please print that article again? i am running

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    recently i attended a wedding followed by a beautiful dinner, after which the
    groom mashed a piece of wedding cake all over his bride''s face. i turned to my
    two daughters and said, "i''ll give this marriage two years." i wasn''t being
    facetious, either. how could any woman ever trust a man who only hours before
    had promised to love, honor and cherish her-then turns around and hits her in
    the face with a piece of cake? had i been the bride, the marriage would have been
    the shortest on record. a friend of mine attended a wedding last week, and she
    said the groom smashed cake in his bride''s face. she slapped him not once but
    twice-then spent the rest of her reception crying because she felt he had ruined
    her wedding. i would like to know what lowlife started this tradition? does this
    have some sort of sentimental value? i seem to have missed the train on this one.
    if the bride was my daughter, i would have started a new tradition. it would be:
    the mother-in-law burns the marriage license, kicks the groom in the behind, and
    then takes the bride home. what are your thoughts on this? rosalie sarnelli, las

    living in hawaii, we get hit with some really far-out geographical situations.
    recently i heard a sales clerk tell a tourist that the item he wanted was available
    at the mainland store. the tourist then calmly asked, "where is the mainland?"
    a local reservations agent got a call from a lady on the mainland who asked if
    the islands were completely surrounded by water. but the all-time classic happened
    a couple of years ago on the beach. while watching the lovely maui sunset, a lady
    tourist asked, "what ocean is this?" i replied, "it''s the pacific." she said,
    "oh, i live near an ocean. i guess it must be the other one." i asked her where
    she lived, and she replied, "san francisco." i said, "that''s the pacific ocean
    too." she responded with frustration, "oh, well, i was never very good at history."

    and cd players brought from home must be checked by the engineering department.
    many fires have been started by a faulty electrical appliance. 5. please don''t
    eat the patient''s meals. we want to see how much the patient has eaten when the
    patient''s tray is returned to the kitchen. 6. leave the pets at home. (last christmas,
    a mother brought a hamster in her purse for her little boy. it got loose, and

    in a recent column, you asked readers to send in their pet peeves with respect

    million dollars." abby, there is a $499,999.50 difference between those two. a
    million and a half dollars can only mean $1 million and 50 cents. the "half" takes
    on the dimensions of the word following it, not that preceding it. why should
    anyone care? perhaps because if we don''t care, the younger generation will think
    it doesn''t matter - besides, who needs mathematics anyway? the other evening,

    past autumn, after all the leaves had fallen from the trees, great gusts of wind
    blew, depositing huge piles of leaves on my front lawn and patio. it took me five
    days to gather up the leaves that fell from my neighbor''s trees onto my property.
    my neighbor pretended she didn''t even see me picking up those leaves when she
    left her home to get into her car. abby, isn''t it the responsibility of the person
    who owns the shedding trees to pick up the leaves wherever they may fall? what
    does the law say? hopping mad'

  voice: genuinely_stuck
  body: 'dear readers: i have just finished a paperback book, "what you can do to
    avoid aids," by magic johnson. this little book should be required reading for
    everyone who is old enough to read. here are some (edited) excerpts: "you''ve
    probably been hearing a lot about hiv-infection and aids. what you''ve heard may
    have scared you. but being scared won''t help you make wise choices about your
    health. being educated will. let me lay out the basics here so you''ll understand
    what hiv and aids are, and how hiv is-and isn''t-spread. i''ll start with two
    simple definitions: "hiv stands for human immunodeficiency virus. human means
    human beings, not animals, plants or insects. immuno- refers to the immune system-the
    organs and cells that fight off diseases and infections in our bodies. deficiency
    means a breakdown or lack of something, so immunodeficiency means the immune system
    is damaged and can''t fight off infections or diseases. a virus is a tiny germ
    able to cause diseases. certain viruses, such as hiv, can enter the cells of your
    body and prevent them from doing what they''re supposed to do. "hiv can be spread
    from person to person and cause an infected person''s immune system to break down
    or collapse completely. hiv is the virus that causes aids. "aids stands for acquired
    immunodeficiency syndrome. what do those words mean? acquired means you''re not
    born with it, but can develop it later. immunodeficiency means your immune system
    is damaged and can''t fight off infections or diseases. syndrome means a combination
    of physical signs and symptoms. "let''s look at this like a war. the main soldiers
    in your immune system are white blood cells. they attack the viruses, bacteria
    and other foreign agents that invade your body. normally, your white cells destroy
    these invaders and keep you from getting infections or diseases. when hiv enters
    your body, it destroys the white blood cells. when this happens, you become a
    target for diseases and infections that healthy people can usually fight off.
    these `opportunistic'' infections include pneumonia, tuberculosis, yeast infections
    and other infections. you are also vulnerable to certain cancers. when you have
    hiv and have developed certain infections, doctors say you have aids. "people
    do not die of aids: they die because the virus makes their bodies too weak to
    fight off infections. "being infected with hiv doesn''t mean you automatically
    have aids; it means sooner or later you will develop aids. "the virus can live
    in your body for 10 years (or longer) before you show any symptoms. during that
    time you may feel and look healthy, but you can infect others with the virus.
    in other words, you can pass it on to others without you or your partner knowing
    it. in fact, most people who have hiv don''t even know they are infected! the
    only way a doctor can diagnose hiv-infection is by a blood test. "there is no
    cure yet, but if you''re diagnosed early and get into treatment, your chances
    of living longer are better because there are medications to keep you healthy
    and postpone the development of aids." readers: "what you can do to avoid aids"
    is published by times books. it costs only $3.99. it is also available on audiocassette
    for $5.99. net profits go directly to the magic johnson foundation for prevention,
    education, research and care in the battle against aids.'

    enough limericks - but if you will, please correct the public''s misperception
    that edward lear (no relation to norman) invented the limerick. he merely popularized
    the clean limerick - and only because his "book of nonsense" caught the public''s
    fancy in 1863, although its first publication in 1846 made nary a ripple. the
    clean limerick fad lasted only five years (thank god), but the genuine article
    still exists (and has for several centuries) as the main vehicle for vulgar doggerel.
    please refer to the excellent, scholarly work "the limerick" by g. legman (bell
    publishing), which has a comprehensive introduction, tracing the history of this
    verse form, and gives 1,700 examples of genuine limericks. with few exceptions,
    they are vulgar, salacious and unfit for family newspapers. in short, indicative
    of the true nature of the beast. abby, i know i said "enough limericks" - but
    they are addictive, aren''t they? example is professor morris bishop''s masterpiece:
    the limerick is furtive and mean, you must keep her in close quarantine, or she
    sneaks to the slums and promptly becomes disorderly, drunk and obscene. v. appleman,

    sad to say, several times a week, we read in the newspapers about families having
    lost all their possessions as a result of a fire and having no insurance. this,
    of course, is most often true of people who rent their homes or apartments. don''t
    they realize that fire insurance for renters is available for a very low fee?
    fire is a terrible tragedy to endure without financial hardship added to one''s
    woes. passing this on to your readers and urging them to insure their personal
    possessions could be a great service. perhaps some people don''t know that renter''s
    insurance is available - or the thought of getting it never occurred to them.

    ever since tv stations began showing that ad for a security system designed for
    elderly people who live alone and may need assistance because they have "fallen
    and can''t get up," there has been a veritable deluge of jokes based on that theme.
    recently, the cable comedy channel ran a string of excerpts from comedians'' routines
    that treated this misfortune as a joke. i am simply astounded at the ignorance
    and insensitivity of these comics. a few weeks ago, my father, who is in his 80s
    and a semi-invalid, fell in the bathtub and couldn''t pull himself up. my mother,
    who is also in her 80s and very frail, couldn''t help him. finally, they called
    911 for help. the paramedics who came were very compassionate and tactful, but
    can you imagine how embarrassing it must have been for a once strong and independent
    man to be reduced to this? one day, when these thoughtless young people are no
    longer young and strong, something like this may happen to them. i hope they remember

    i teach macroeconomics at the university of massachusetts, amherst. i have decided
    a reasonable exam question is: "how big is the u.s. federal budget deficit?" most
    of my students answer correctly: approximately $400 billion. what my students
    still find surprising is the size of the tax increase necessary to eliminate that
    deficit. if the balanced-budget amendment passes, and each of the 250 million
    people in the united states has his or her taxes increased by an equal amount
    to cover the deficit, that will be a $1,600 tax increase. if we increase taxes
    for only those people in the labor force (about 120 million people), balancing
    the federal budget will require a tax increase of more than $3,300 per working
    person per year. that''s not a one-time increase, but an annual increase. moreover,
    this will not reduce the outstanding debt of the u.s. government, which is currently
    about $4 trillion (or $4 million million); such a tax increase will simply stop
    our nation''s debt from increasing any further. i think most people will be surprised
    by these figures. what do you think? martha l. olney, associate professor of economics'

  body: 'dear readers: awhile back, i had a column on the misuse of words and other
    irritants, and named a few. i then asked readers to send in their pet peeves concerning
    common mistakes in grammar and pronunciation. how''s this for a collection? read
    on: the "lie" and "lay" confusion: to "lay" means to set or put - to "lie" means
    to recline. remember, chickens lay eggs. people lie down. the use of "all are
    not" when the person means "not all are." example: saying, "all women are not
    beautiful," when one means, "not all women are beautiful." we frequently hear
    "between you and i." wrong! it''s "between you and me." also, one hears supposedly
    educated people say "between she and i" instead of the correct "between her and
    me." another irritant is "try and" instead of "try to." for example, one may try
    to win - then lose. but how can one try and win - and then lose? and how about
    the word "irregardless"? just plain "regardless" will do. however, regardless
    of how "irregardless" grates on one''s nerves, it has nosed its way into the dictionary.
    (it means "regardless.") talk about overusing a word, i nominate "basically."
    people who start every other sentence with the word "basically" usually have limited
    vocabularies. my pet peeve - double negatives: "i don''t know nothing" and "we
    don''t go nowhere" are the worst offenders. some people think the plural of "you"
    is "youse." it''s not. "you" is both singular and plural. also, people use the
    word "snuck" instead of "sneaked." although "snuck" somehow sneaked into the dictionary,
    it''s not used by people who use proper english. ask someone to define "hoi polloi,"
    and it''s a good bet that he will say "high-tone or upper class." actually, it
    means "the masses" - or the general population. "nuclear" is pronounced "nuke-lee-er"
    - not "nuke-you-ler." and how about "he''s got," "she''s got" and "they''ve got"?
    the correct word is "has." ("he has," "she has." . . . "got" has got to go!) we
    frequently hear that a man has "prostrate" trouble, when actually he has "pros-tate"
    trouble. another error - using the word "myself" instead of "me." example: "if
    you have any questions, see bobby or myself after the meeting." "see bobby or
    me" is correct. the "infer" and "imply" mix-up: the writer "implies"; the reader
    "infers." (it''s like pitching and catching.) please do not say "o" instead of
    "zero." don''t use the word "that" when "who" is correct. ("that" refers to inanimate
    objects - "who" to people.) finally, the misuse of the word "ask": some say "ax"
    instead of "ask." i would much rather be "asked" than "axed." wouldn''t you?'

    i cannot forget a letter you had in your column some time ago. it was written
    by a person who didn''t know what to say when asked what he did for a living.
    from the tone of the letter i concluded that the person was working for minimum
    wage, or doing some kind of manual labor of which he was somewhat ashamed. this,
    coupled with the following remark a school principal made to my son, prompts this
    letter. my son was having problems in school, so his teacher took him to the principal.
    in talking to my son, the principal asked, "do you want to be a ditch digger all
    your life?" my son replied, "what''s wrong with being a ditch digger? it''s honest
    work." the principal called me to school because of my son''s "smart mouth." when
    the principal repeated what my son had said, i responded: "nothing was wrong with
    what he said. if there were no ditch diggers we''d be up to our necks in water
    and filth." i also told the principal he was dead wrong to demean ditch diggers.
    then i went on to say: "i am a professional who works with professionals, and
    i get really steamed when my co-workers look down on people who are minimum-wage
    laborers. if no one picked up the garbage, cleaned the septic tanks, laid sewage
    pipes, picked the crops and worked in the fields, where would we be? this country
    was founded on hard work - most of it manual labor. pride comes in doing the best
    you can with whatever talents you possess." i don''t know the author, but a verse
    i know goes something like this: "use what talents you possess, for the woods
    would be silent if no birds sang, except the best." c.v.j.'

    i am still steamed about the letter signed "slinging hash in florida." i just
    retired after 31 years of waitressing, and i loved my job more than you can imagine.
    let me tell you why that waitress said, "a canoe tips easier than a canadian."
    canadians do not realize that in the united states, servers are paid $2.01 an
    hour - plus the computer takes 8 percent out of each total for our taxes. one
    night, i had a party of eight. each had a cocktail, appetizer, soup, salad, main
    course, dessert, plus three or four refills of coffee or tea. they were a great
    group and everyone raved over my service. the total bill was $131. the man who
    paid the bill left $1.30 on the table. (can you imagine?) i was so mad, i ran
    after him, chased him to his car and tried to give him the $1.30, telling him
    that he needed it more than i did. he looked shocked and asked, "doesn''t the
    management pay you a decent salary?" when i told him how much servers are paid,
    he was flabbergasted. he tried to give me some money, but i wouldn''t take it.
    later, he mailed me a $20 bill with a note saying that i was the best waitress
    he had ever had, and it was signed by everyone who was in that party. former florida

    to say that i hurt her deeply when i dropped her, because i was ready for a sexual
    relationship and she wasn''t. i ended up dating several girls i couldn''t take
    home to momma. lisa started dating a real straight arrow. i lost track of lisa
    when she went off to college and became engaged to the straight arrow. i married
    someone else and later divorced (no children), but i''ve never been able to forget
    lisa. with our 20th high school reunion approaching, i''ve been in touch with
    some old friends from high school and learned that lisa never married the straight
    arrow - in fact, she never married at all. however, she had a son a few years
    ago and gave him the same first name as mine. while it may have been a coincidence,
    it is not a very common name. now i''m wondering if maybe she hasn''t been able
    to forget me either, but i haven''t the faintest idea of how to approach her.
    i live 2,000 miles from my hometown, and don''t know if there is another man in
    lisa''s life. i would go to the reunion if i knew she''d be there and was not

    as election time draws near, we see a downright hostile intolerance to anyone

    catholic, he was protestant; i''m a republican, he was a democrat; i like black
    olives, he liked green, etc.) yet we had total respect for each other, and a wonderful
    marriage for 46 years - until he passed away. come election time, we sat at our
    dinner table, trading information from both political parties, trying to persuade
    each other not to go to the polls and cancel out each other''s vote. dinnertime
    could get pretty heated with our four sons taking part. when they were older,
    we ended up with two registered democrats and two republicans. a sense of humor

    my brother, who is serving in the army overseas, is in love with our cousin. the
    feeling appears to be mutual, but obviously, legalities are prevailing. we know
    it is illegal in some states for first cousins to marry. we also know that it
    is legal for second cousins to marry. in this age of divorce and remarriage, where
    do the half-cousins fit in? our grandmother was married twice, to different men.
    a daughter of the first marriage had a son. a daughter of the second marriage
    had a daughter. grandma''s children are half-siblings. but what are grandma''s
    grandchildren? (the only common link is grandma.) might any of your readers or

    or should they remain just kissing cousins? concerned brother'

    please read these letters from the houston post''s "sound off" section. they show
    a different perspective in the rodney king case. m.w. daura, bellaire, texas here''s
    the first letter: "i was in a colorado hotel room with cable tv that carried `court
    in session,'' a live broadcast of current court cases where television was permitted,
    much like c-span carries congressional sessions. "the rodney king trial was on
    for six hours each day. i saw a total of 40 hours. i heard and saw videotapes
    and testimony of the normal effect of stun guns - police-in-training receiving
    a stun gun shot, and falling like poleaxed steers - yet rodney king only blinked
    and kept coming at the officers. "i heard testimony of mr. king''s throwing officers
    - two at a time - to the ground like rag dolls. all this was in the 20 minutes
    before the famous one-minute `bite'' that was all most of the media and a segment
    of our population saw. "the media explained the looting, burning, beating and
    killing as `rage'' over the verdict. i''m sorry, but it''s happened too often,
    and appears to be simply a carefree opportunity for looting, burning, beating
    and killing. (examples: watts, miami, the st. croix looting after hurricane hugo,
    and others.)" glen swenumson, houston here''s the second letter: "all my life
    i''ve supported a free press and appreciated the role it serves in keeping the
    public informed. but today i am angry. i feel that television has taken me for
    a ride. "for 13 months i''ve seen a 90-second clip of videotape that shows a man
    face down on the ground and four police officers taking turns hitting him with
    batons. "it wasn''t until 3 a.m. on friday, on cnn, that i was finally given the
    opportunity to see the tape in its entirety. here i saw a man who had been hit
    four times with 50,000 volts of electricity continue to fight and resist police.
    i saw him lunging at a policeman. i saw him defying all normal reaction to pain,
    and behaving as if he could feel no pain. "i saw a brief moment when he lay still,
    and at that moment one policeman reached for his handcuffs. then the man was up
    on his hands and knees again. "i wonder, who decided to limit the public''s access
    to the entire tape?" julie r. wise, houston'

    can you imagine my surprise when i read the letter in your column about the woman
    who became pregnant when she took antibiotics while she was on the pill? that''s
    exactly what happened to me. when my twin sons were 3 months old, i went back
    on the pill. a month later, my physician prescribed an antibiotic for an infection
    and, you guessed it - i got pregnant immediately. believe me, abby, we were not
    ready emotionally, financially or any other way to have another child. we were
    still in a state of confusion and had our hands full with the twins. when i recovered
    from the shock, i asked my doctor why the pill didn''t work, and he told me it
    must have been the antibiotic - then he added rather sheepishly, "that information
    was in the insert, which you should have read." well, of course i had not read
    the insert that came with the antibiotic. i doubt if many people would - unless
    they had been instructed to do so. however, today we have a beautiful - and thank
    god, healthy - baby girl. she was an unwanted pregnancy, but she was definitely
    a very much wanted child. now when someone asks me if she was an accident, i reply,
    "no, she was a beautiful surprise." doctors should tell their patients everything
    they need to know about the medications they''re instructed to take, and not just
    assume that the patients are going to read the inserts that come with the medications.

    the three smokers chain-smoked during the entire meal. since the meal took about
    two hours, i don''t think it would have been unreasonable for the smokers to have
    abstained for that short period of time - or they could have excused themselves

  body: 'dear readers: i recently wrote a column on the misuse of words, grammatical
    goofs and assorted speech irritants, and invited my readers to send me their pet
    peeves concerning same. well, here''s collection no. 2: the most annoying speech
    irritant is still all those "you knows?" and a close second is beginning every
    sentence with "basically." if you think "epitome" means the ultimate, the tops
    or the height of - go stand in the corner. "epitome" means a person or thing that
    is typical of or possesses to a high degree the features of a whole class. the
    word "arthritis" is correctly pronounced "arth-right-us" (three syllables); so
    why do so many people insist on pronouncing it "arthur-ritis"? the same for the
    word "athlete" - not "ath-a-leet." my pet peeve is the lawyer or journalist who
    uses the word "gentleman" as follows: "according to the police report, a masked
    gentleman knocked the elderly woman to the ground and fled with her purse." (some
    "gentleman.") the word "nauseous" is often misused, even by well-educated professionals,
    instead of the word "nauseated." here''s a way to remember the distinction: if
    you are nauseated, you are sick. if you are nauseous, you make other people sick.
    do you know what an asterisk is? of course you do. it''s the little starlike symbol
    used in print to indicate the omission of letters or words. but why do most people
    pronounce it "ass-trick"? the confusion with "lie" and "lay" is still baffling
    to many. i explained that people lie down and chickens lay eggs. a reader now
    informs me, "people lay money on the counter, dogs lie by the fire, and magazines
    are found lying on the table. all last summer, i lay in my hammock and didn''t
    produce a single egg." prominent newscasters have said "most unique" and "partially
    destroyed." "unique" and "destroyed" are absolute terms and cannot be qualified,
    any more than "pregnant" or "dead." please do not confuse "momento" and "memento."
    a momento is a unit of time (spanish: "uno momento"). a memento is a souvenir,
    a memory. finally, the misplaced "only" is a common gaffe. for example, the onetime
    popular song, "i only have eyes for you" is meant to say, "i have eyes for you
    only." for a lover to croon, "i only have eyes for you," is to say: "i have no
    lips, no arms, or anything else - only eyes - for you," which would be a grave
    disappointment for both of them. never say, "it''s a true fact." if it''s a fact,
    it''s true. also, forget "old antique." if it''s an antique - it''s old. in closing
    - for heaven''s sake, never say, "for heaven''s sakes." some people do, so for
    heaven''s sake, watch your language. if you have a pet peeve i haven''t mentioned,
    please send it to me. ---------- this one''s for everybody, from teens to seniors.

    my husband has been reading up on the subject of sex, and he is of the opinion
    that if a woman doesn''t enjoy sex right up to the grave, there must be something
    wrong with her. at age 50, and after 30 years of marriage, i would like to forget
    about sex altogether. believe me, i''ve paid my dues. where is it written that
    a woman should be ready and willing to perform every time her man beckons? i suspect
    that many (if not most) women get very little physical satisfaction out of sex;
    they just go through the motions because they want to do something for men they
    love. i can''t believe that i''m the only woman who feels this way. please poll
    your readers, abby. and if they''re honest, i think you will find that i am right.

    i have enjoyed your column for many years, so i''m sending you something your
    readers might enjoy. it is a birthday card i just received. i hope you like it.
    a.d. bradley, staten island, n.y. "when i went to the city hall to renew my dog''s
    license, i told the clerk i wanted a license for sex. he said, `i''d like one,
    too!'' "then i said, `but this is a dog.'' "he said he didn''t care what she looked
    like. then i said, `you don''t understand. i''ve had sex since i was 9 years old.''
    he winked at me and said, `you must have been quite a kid.'' "when i got married
    and went on my honeymoon, i took my dog with me. i told the hotel clerk i wanted
    a room for my wife and me, and a special room for sex. he said, `you don''t need
    a special room for sex. as long as you pay your bill, we don''t care what you
    do.'' "i said, `look, you don''t seem to understand. sex keeps me awake at night.''
    "the clerk said, `funny, i have the same problem.'' "well, one day, i entered
    sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog got loose and ran
    away. another contestant asked me why i was just standing there, looking disappointed.
    i told him i had planned to have sex in the contest. he said, `wonderful! if you
    sell tickets, you''ll clean up!'' " `but you don''t understand,'' i said. `i want
    to have sex on tv.'' he said, `they already have that on cable. it''s no big deal
    anymore.'' "well, my wife and i decided to separate, so we went to court to fight
    for custody of the dog. "i said to the judge, `your honor, i had sex before i
    was married.'' the judge said, `the court is not a confessional. please stick
    to the facts.'' then i told him that after i was married, sex left me. he said,
    `me, too.'' "well, last night sex ran away again, and i spent hours looking all
    over town for him. a cop came over to me and asked, `what are you doing in this
    alley at 4 in the morning?'' i said, `i''m looking for sex.'' "my case comes up
    on friday."'

    the letter from "baffled," who suggested that we just print enough money to pay
    off the national debt, calls to mind a kitchen debate i had with a neighbor back
    in 1956. i tried to illustrate, by means of a ludicrous example, the futility
    of endless price/wage increases without productivity increases. i posed this scenario:
    "assume the population of the united states to be 250 million people. if each
    person were to give you 1 cent, you would have $2.5 million - and not one donor
    would complain about the loss of a penny, right?" she agreed. i then said, "why
    not make a list of every person in the united states. start with the name at the
    top of the list and have everybody give that person 1 cent. that person would
    then be a millionaire. move to the next person on the list and do the same. when
    you have gone through the entire list, everyone is a millionaire, right?" she
    pondered for a few minutes, then she said, "it sounds like a good idea, but there
    must be something wrong with it or someone else would have thought of it already."
    i changed the subject. jim tillotson, los altos, calif.'

    into a bar, sit down and have a drink without some man bothering them. how are

    wish to be bothered wore a wedding ring. that doesn''t work anymore. single women
    wear wedding rings, and some married women take theirs off. these women who complain
    to you probably pass by men every day who are unattached and would be right for
    them, but the more decent a man is, the less likely he is to approach a woman
    he doesn''t know. abby, why don''t you suggest some way for women and men to communicate

    on july 13, 1990, my life was changed forever. what was supposed to be the time
    of my life turned out to be the trial of my life. i had been happily married for
    nine years, and we were expecting our first child. one moment, my husband and
    i were returning from a friend''s anniversary celebration, and the next moment,
    i woke up in the hospital; my husband was dead and my prematurely born baby was
    in the intensive care unit. it was all because of a drunken driver - and that
    driver was me. i took a life, and god gave me a life. i had read about things
    like this, but never thought it could happen to me. now here i am in jail, with
    no husband. my in-laws have lost their son, and my beautiful baby boy is fatherless.
    i changed so many lives that night. i will be going home soon to be with my family.
    but what about his family, who will never again see the son they loved or hear
    him say, "i love you, mom and dad"? i hope this letter leaves an impact. it could

    there was an old maid in duluth who wept when she thought of her youth remembering
    the chances she missed at school dances and once in a telephone booth. if "old
    maid''s" father left home 50 years ago, her siblings were old enough to have been
    on their own for the past 35 years. she says she and her sister are holding down
    the fort. what fort? their mother is dead, and "old maid" is in her 60s, so how
    can she blame her unmarried state on the fact that she raised her siblings 50
    years ago? give me a break! instead of apologizing, you should have told her to
    get on with her life. she sounds like she''s living in the past and enjoying her

    as a recent european immigrant to the united states, i am shocked and disturbed
    by the television series "cops." is there not a law within your constitution that
    is supposed to protect a citizen''s right to privacy? and isn''t a person presumed
    innocent until proven guilty? when police officers burst into a person''s home
    with a television crew to arrest suspects, clearly the rights of the suspects
    are being violated. and not only the rights of the suspects, but the rights of
    their families and visitors, too. where do we draw the line? what right do we
    have to intrude and expose their misfortune? and what about the children being
    subjected to public humiliation? it seems to me that in a nation that claims to
    be in the forefront of western democracies, it''s paradoxical that a television
    show like "cops" is allowed to air. before the eyes of millions of viewers, some
    people who are merely suspects are shown being arrested, and denied their rights.

    you once referred to an embarrassing encounter you experienced. with the best
    of intentions, you complimented a gentleman whom you had just met on his lush
    head of hair - then moments later when he turned around, you realized he was wearing
    a full toupee. i think i can top that. a woman i know was having serious problems
    with thinning hair due to chemotherapy treatments and radiation for cancer. she
    appeared at a country club luncheon one afternoon with a lovely, stylish wig.
    a woman she had never seen before approached her, admired her hairdo - then said,
    "that''s not a wig, is it?" without missing a beat, the wig wearer smiled and
    said, "as a matter of fact, it is." then she removed it from her head and handed
    it to the curious stranger - who turned beet red. true story, a chicagoan'

    i was sitting in the terminal area of the atlanta airport recently, waiting to
    board my flight. across from me, there was a woman telling a little girl to be
    quiet. the woman pointed at me and said, "do you see that man over there? if you
    don''t sit down and be quiet, he''s going to grab you and throw you into the river!"
    i didn''t appreciate that comment at all, so i stood up to look for another place
    to sit. the little girl then started to scream bloody murder and tried to hide
    behind her mother. she was screaming, "mommy, mommy, don''t let that bad man hurt
    me!" a security officer came over to us and asked the woman if she wanted to have
    me arrested. all the people in that area, not knowing what had taken place, thought
    i was some kind of pervert. with so much about child abuse these days, a statement
    like the one the mother used to quiet her daughter is very believable to a small

    my sisters and i have just closed our late father''s estate, and i hope this message
    will get through to others who eventually will face the same challenge. we will
    talk about knowing as much as possible about our family histories - but do we
    really know who is in the photo albums or where that old antique copper bed warmer
    came from? we thought we had asked all the right questions and had even written
    pages of historical interest to the family. what we discovered in the final cleaning
    of the cupboards were jewels we had no idea existed. (by jewels i mean items like
    the lovely wooden ukulele, circa 1917 - who bought it? who played it? what fun
    picturing that scenario!) abby, won''t you encourage anyone with living parents
    to poke into the cupboards and closets and pull something out each time they visit?
    tell the parents what you ran across and build a wonderful conversation, urging
    them to talk about the items and what sentimental value they have. it''s never
    too early to begin doing any of these suggested things and adapt them to your
    own particular situation. even if you have a parent who is living in a home -
    wouldn''t that make for a more inspired visit and provide something concrete to
    talk about? just think what memorable thoughts might be left with your parent
    after your visit is ended. something we are doing for our own children is using
    self-sticking labels on the back of all our framed photos, identifying the people,
    the places and the year each was taken. here''s to even more creative ideas for
    communicating with those you love. karin conly, carlsbad, calif.'

    you asked senior citizens what their biggest problems were. money? health? loneliness?

    most women have are this: when a husband retires, he follows his wife around all
    day remarking on how she does the housework, cooking, etc., and none of it is
    complimentary. also, he never lets his wife go anywhere alone. he has to tag along
    because his own interest in sex is waning, and he starts accusing her of seeing
    other men. in other words, husbands get jealous because they can''t perform as
    well themselves. men retire, but we middle-class wives continue to do our regular
    housework because of our limited income, which has been worsened by inflation.

    you frequently receive letters from long-suffering wives who complain because
    their husbands have a habit of getting "lost" in bars on their way home from work.
    allow me to suggest a solution that was used with considerable success by one
    such wife in omaha: as was his custom when detained at a bar, the husband telephoned
    home. the instant he heard his wife on the other end of the line, he began, "now,
    honey, before you say anything, i just want to . . ." then he heard his wife''s
    voice speaking in calm, modulated tones, ". . . when and if you decide to come
    home, you will find your dinner in the oven. but i won''t be here. don''t try
    to find me. and by the way, go to hell. this is a recording." the husband rushed
    home in a panic. the house was dark. the wife''s car was missing from the garage.
    to his relief, he found his wife in bed. she turned on a light and confirmed that
    the voice he had heard was no recording - it was live. the missing car? she had
    parked it around the corner on a side street. "but next time," she said, "it might
    not be a joke." so far, there''s been no next time. robert mc morris, omaha world

    my husband isn''t an alcoholic, but after he''s had a few, he gets very generous

    a neighbor of mine loves to sew, and she has made some lovely things. she made

    i bought a frame for it and presented it to my neighbor to show my appreciation.
    she seemed pleased and placed the picture on her piano. a few months later, i
    noticed that she had placed a picture of her dog in that frame, and my daughter''s
    picture was nowhere to be seen. i finally told her that as long as she wasn''t

    and me, his stepmother-know his early years only from pictures and family stories.
    we missed the first steps and the first day of school, but we were there for high
    school and college graduation. when my stepson was in high school and college,
    his father and i watched with admiration as he skillfully and comfortably maneuvered
    between his father and his mother for vacations and special events. we smiled
    proudly as we observed him tactfully handling the "whom do i spend my birthday
    with?" question, and as he lined up an early christmas with us and a christmas
    day celebration with his mother. but now it''s time for his most special event
    yet, and it''s not one for which he can schedule us separately. weddings with
    divorced parents and stepparents are common now, of course. but such occasions
    do require a little extra care, and they certainly attract a little extra attention.
    even those not closely involved offer helpful comments. a woman i met while shopping
    for a dress for the ceremony told me her daughter had married a man with four
    parents. she went on to explain how well behaved all four parents were at the
    service-especially the stepmother-as if speaking of a level of grace to which
    i could aspire. some people ask direct questions. will the ex-spouses act civilly
    when they are together? (answer: there''ll be no food fight at the reception.)
    and who will sit in what pew-will mom or dad get the place of honor, or-heaven
    forbid-could we all sit together in one pew? (answer: we''ll abide by the bride''s
    wishes.) will the "formers" and "currents" talk to each other? (answer: why wouldn''t
    we? it''s not often you find another couple as interested in your kids as you
    are.) the list of questions goes on and on. would dear abby or emily post approve
    of the "step" arrangements we''ve worked out? who knows? as long as things are
    the way that the bride and bridegroom want them, that''s all that matters. the
    young man who''s going to walk down that aisle is dear to us, and none of his
    parents-neither the originals nor the steps-will let our young diplomat down on
    his big day. we''d like to think we''ve learned something from him over all these
    years. caption: photo: photo by ellis herwig/mga/photri inc. illustration photo'

    thank you for mentioning the fact that there are people who take advantage of
    baby-sitters. let me tell you about one couple who were very gracious. when my
    daughter baby-sat while going to high school, the going rate was 50 cents an hour.
    obviously, that was many years ago - at least 25. she had been recommended as
    a very responsible baby-sitter to a young couple who were just getting started
    in the movies. when the couple returned, my daughter was asked, "how much do we
    owe you?" she replied, "you were gone five hours, so that will be $2.50." "oh,
    no," the man said, "that''s not enough - we pay a dollar an hour in new york,
    and that is what we will pay you." the couple were tyne daly and her former husband,
    georg stanford brown. hurrah for nice people! miriam b. mason, woodland hills,

    i have been dating a man for about five years. he has a daughter, 22, and a son,
    20. both are in college, but they come home on weekends to live with their father.
    when they are home, it is not uncommon for his daughter to sleep in the same bed
    with him. i think this is inappropriate, and told him so. he said, "you must have
    a problem." although they sleep in a king-sized bed, he sleeps in his jockey shorts.
    he says his daughter likes to fall asleep watching tv there, but, abby, this is
    not the only tv in the house. he also says that his daughter and son sleep in
    the same bed when they are at college. they have a two-bedroom apartment, but
    he says his son doesn''t like sleeping in a twin bed, so he sleeps with his sister
    in a queen-size bed. is this normal? disconcerted in redmond, wash.'

    about a week ago, my new neighbors asked to borrow my children''s bicycles. i

    it repaired. the new neighbor said her husband was a mechanic and she''d ask him
    to look at it and see if maybe he could fix it. i said, "ok," so she took the
    bike, which made three. the next day, i got a call from this neighbor telling
    me that her husband had fixed the bike and said she was bringing it over. when
    she brought the three bikes over, she said, "you owe me $10." i nearly fainted.
    i did not pay her anything because i thought her husband was fixing the bike as
    a favor, because we let his kids use the two bikes that were in really good shape.

    for one of the few times in more than 20 years of readership, i find myself in
    total disagreement with your advice. i refer to the woman whose son was being
    divorced after only 10 months of marriage and who wondered what should be done
    with the wedding gifts, including money. your reply was that since the marriage
    didn''t last a year, all gifts should be returned. it is my feeling that a gift,
    whether it be cash or a toaster, is just that - a gift, which becomes the property
    of the receiver with no strings attached. what does the length of the marriage
    have to do with it? i cannot believe anyone would give a present on the condition
    that the marriage must endure in order for the recipient to have the right to
    retain possession of the gift. the wedding presents, notwithstanding the duration
    (or lack thereof) of the marriage, belong to the couple to be divided or disposed
    of as they see fit. the original donors do not even have to be considered. i would

    outside, she''s there. i hang clothes, she''s there. my husband and i value our
    time alone with our kids, yet our privacy always seems to be invaded by this neighbor
    child. she is not my responsibility, and i resent her being there all the time.
    it has really gotten out of hand these last two years. my own children keep me
    very busy and i like spending time with them. i wouldn''t mind if kristie came
    over occasionally, but she practically lives here. i never let my kids out of
    my sight - and they never impose on anyone. i wouldn''t allow it. kristie hangs
    around here and comes into my house for hours at a time, and her parents don''t
    even look for her. i feel as thought i am an unpaid sitter for this child. any
    suggestions on how to handle this situation in a kindly manner would be appreciated.
    it''s not the child''s fault, but how do we deal with this problem? family of
    four plus one'

    i need your advice on the proper thing to do in a situation in which my wife and
    i will soon find ourselves. our son is marrying a woman who lives in a distant
    state. her mother, whom we have never met, invited my wife and me to stay in her
    home when we come for the wedding, which will be three days total. we feel that
    we should offer to do something to cover at least the expense of the food - but
    we don''t want to offend her. have you any suggestions as to how we can accept
    the invitation and yet feel that we have held up our end of the arrangement? we
    have never met these people, and we''d like to make a good impression on them.

    we aren''t jewish and don''t have a copy of leo rosten''s dictionary. we all speak
    english around these parts, with maybe a little spanish here and there. during

  body: 'dear readers: october has traditionally been down syndrome awareness month,
    and has been so declared by the u.s. congress. because i have so often heard from
    parents or grandparents of babies born with various disabilities, i offer the
    following, which has become a favorite: welcome to holland by emily pearl kingsley
    "i am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability-to
    try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it,
    to imagine how it would feel. it''s like this . . . "when you''re going to have
    a baby, it''s like planning a fabulous vacation trip-to italy. you buy a bunch
    of guidebooks and make your wonderful plans. the colosseum. the michaelangelo
    david. the gondolas in venice. you may learn some handy phrases in italian. it''s
    all very exciting. "after months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives.
    you pack your bags and off you go. several hours later, the plane lands. the stewardness
    comes in and says, `welcome to holland.'' " `holland?!'' you say, `what do you
    mean, holland? i signed up for italy! i''m supposed to be in italy. all my life
    i''ve dreamed of going to italy.'' "but there''s been a change in the flight plan.
    they''ve landed in holland and there you must stay. the important thing is that
    they haven''t taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence,
    famine and disease. it''s just a different place. "so you must go out and buy
    new guidebooks. and you must learn a whole new language. and you will meet a whole
    new group of people you would never have met. "it''s just a different place. it''s
    slower-paced than italy, less flashy than italy. but after you''ve been there
    for a while and you catch your breath, you look around, and you begin to notice
    that holland has windmills, holland even has rembrandts. "but everyone you know
    is busy coming and going from italy, and they''re all bragging about what a wonderful
    time they had there. and for the rest of your life, you will say, ''yes, that''s
    where i was supposed to go. that''s what i had planned.'' "and the pain of that
    will never, ever, ever go away, because the loss of that dream is a very significant
    loss. "but if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn''t get to italy,
    you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things about
    holland." readers: for information on down syndrome, and to be put in touch with

    when i was young and foolish i was very promiscuous. i went to bed with any guy
    who asked me out - older men, married men, first dates and even an occasional
    pickup. i never tried to count them, but there were dozens. of course i paid a
    terrible price. i picked up crabs, herpes, gonorrhea and had two abortions. (i
    don''t know how i missed aids because i never used protection.) in an effort to
    get my life together, at age 26, i moved to a distant state, met the most wonderful
    man in the world, fell head over heels in love, and we were married within a year.
    i never told him about my past - i pretended to be a virgin. now the problem.
    i am pregnant, and because of my herpes, i may have to have a c-section. i was
    totally honest with my doctor. he says he will keep my past confidential, but
    if a c-section is necessary, he may have to discuss the reason with my husband.
    abby, if my husband knew how many men i''ve slept with, he would be devastated.
    i doubt that he would leave me, but he would probably never trust me again. i
    am seeing a counselor who advised me to tell my husband no more than is absolutely
    necessary. my minister advised me to tell my husband everything and pray for his
    forgiveness. part of me wants to take my minister''s advice; the other part says,
    "keep your past to yourself and live a good christian life from now on." what
    do you say, abby? sinned and sorry'

    message is: "test your detector-it''s sound advice!" fire kills about 5,000 people
    in the u.s. every year-most of them in their homes. the vast majority of these
    deaths occur needlessly, say the experts at the national fire prevention association.
    the association has developed this fire safety quiz to help dispel the myths about
    fire. take this test. you may learn some valuable lessons: 1. what is the leading
    cause of home fires? (a) smoking materials, (b) arson, (c) heating equipment,
    (d) electrical equipment. 2. what is the no. 1 cause of home fire fatalities?
    (a) lightning, (b) smoking materials, (c) cooking equipment, (d) electrical equipment.
    3. where do the majority of fire deaths occur? (a) school, (b) home, (c) work,
    (d) vehicles. 4. the least fire-safe roofing material is: (a) untreated wood shakes,
    (b) asphalt, (c) slate, (d) tile. 5. when do the largest number of home fires
    and associated fatalities occur? (a) spring, (b) summer, (c) fall, (d) winter.
    6. which of the following time segments accounts for the largest number of home
    fire deaths? (a) midnight to 4 a.m., (b) 4 to 10 a.m., (c) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
    (d) 6 p.m. to midnight. 7. in which room do the largest number of home fires start?
    (a) closet, (b) utility room, (c) kitchen, (d) attic. 8. most fire deaths result
    from burns. (a) true, (b) false. 9. if a fire occurred while you were sleeping,
    the smoke would awaken you. (a) true, (b) false. 10. if your clothing were to
    catch on fire, you should (a) run to the bathtub or shower, (b) sit still and
    yell for help, (c) stop, drop and roll, (d) put baking soda on it. 11. if a small
    grease fire starts when you''re cooking, you should not: (a) escape and then call
    the fire department, (b) pour water on it, (c) slide a lid over the pan, (d) turn
    off the heat. 12. if you receive a mild burn while cooking, you should: (a) pack
    it with ice, (b) smear butter on it, (c) run cool water over it, (d) apply ointment.
    the correct answers: 1. c, 2. b, 3. b, 4. a, 5. d, 6. a, 7. c, 8. b, 9. b, 10.
    c, 11. b, 12. c. readers: about 80 percent of all u.s. fire deaths occur in the
    home. most of these fatalities could be prevented if occupants changed risky behaviors
    and removed fire hazards. important things to remember: install smoke detectors
    on every level of your home (particularly outside of the sleeping areas) and keep
    them in working condition by testing monthly and changing batteries at least once
    a year. consider installation of automatic sprinkler systems for even more protection.
    you may also want to consider purchasing fire extinguishers and learning how to
    use them safely and effectively. if you don''t know where to buy one, call your
    local fire department. a suggestion: review these fire prevention tips with your
    children. fires are preventable. ---------- want your phone to ring? get abby''s

    of $350, so i put it on danny''s credit card. (he''d given me the number of his
    card a long time ago when he asked me to do shopping for him.) was it wrong of
    me to have used his credit card to pay off the balance of my hospital bill? now

    for three years, my husband, our 16-year-old daughter and i have received expensive
    christmas gifts from one of my father''s lady friends. (i''ll call her libby.)
    i''ve never met this woman-she is 30 years younger than dad and is only one of
    the many women he''s dated. dad is quite well-to-do, and libby apparently considers
    him marriage material. (he has told us that he will never marry again.) i don''t
    want libby''s gifts, and i dislike writing thank-you notes to someone i''ve never
    met. two years ago in my thank-you note to libby, i told her as graciously as
    i could that it wasn''t necessary to send us gifts, as i know how busy she must
    be. (she''s a part-time model.) she didn''t get the hint because she sent gifts
    again last year. i have sent her only cards. now what? on the spot'

    for reader assistance. this has been a hairy week, to say the least. the first
    person to come to the rescue was my sister, dear abby. her husband has a beard.
    the solution, she said, is a good hair conditioner. "the bristles will turn soft
    and silky," she promised. i am now being flooded with suggestions on how to help
    that troubled reader. pull up a chair and look over my shoulder. from martinsburg,
    w.va.: new mustaches tend to be stiff and bristly, but with time they become soft
    and sensuous. i used to get whisker burn from my clean-shaven previous lover.
    my current heartthrob has a wonderful mustache that gets softer as it grows longer.
    sign me . . . fu manchu''s woman prince george, canada: the best cure for a stiff
    mustache is a little bit of a vinegar rinse when taking a shower. flint, mich.:
    i grew a full beard 10 years ago for a play. my wife liked it, so i kept it. i
    have a suggestion for that man whose mustache scratches his wife. don''t trim
    it too often. once every 10 days is enough. doug santa fe: my wife gave me an
    ultimatum: shave off the mustache or no more lovemaking. a guy at work told me
    to put vaseline on it before going to bed. i did and it worked. no name or initials,
    ann. my wife would kill me. mr. x hillsdale, mich.: tell "blotchy face" there''s
    a simple solution to her problem. a little bit of hand cream on those stiff bristles
    will do the job. i got this hint from my grandmother. gramp had a great big teddy
    roosevelt-type handlebar mustache and that''s how she kept from getting stabbed
    while kissing. buffalo, n.y.: a man''s mustache grows about a half-inch a month.
    it gets softer as it gets longer. if he wants it to get super soft, a cream rinse
    when he''s in the shower will do the trick. randall richmond, va.: i''ve been
    married for 23 years to a man who has not only a mustache but a full beard. mustaches
    are sharp and prickly and can be kind of smothering. the solution? just skip the
    kissing and get to the really good stuff. raleigh, n.c.: "blotchy face" should
    tell her husband to shave his mustache off and start over. then, with a small
    brush, he should brush it every day. when all the hairs grow in one direction,
    they won''t scratch. tom kalamazoo: facial hair is really sexy. i love it, especially
    on a man who is bald. it''s a way of showing real virility. appleton, wis.: any
    woman who complains about a man''s mustache is not thinking ahead. it shouldn''t
    be asking too much to go through a briar patch to get to the picnic. providence,

    my problem is i am too tall. i''m 26, weigh 134 pounds and stand 6 feet tall.
    most people tell me it''s an advantage for a woman to be tall. they don''t know
    how many problems tall women have. it''s almost impossible to find clothes that
    fit, and i would love to wear heels, but if i did, i''d be 6 foot 2. my boyfriend
    is two inches shorter than me, and even though it doesn''t seem to bother him,
    it bothers me. whenever we walk together i slouch so as not to dwarf him. are
    most men intimidated by tall women? it must be hard for them to feel masculine
    with women who are bigger than they are. tall in bergenfield, n.j.'

    when our son was born, he weighed 6 pounds 13 ounces. he was 17 1/2 inches long.
    now, 11 months later, he weighs 10 pounds and is 20 inches long. the problem is
    that almost everyone who sees him asks me why he is so small. i stand 5 feet tall

    about eight years ago, "ted" (my fiance at the time) was a career officer stationed
    in germany with the u.s. army. i went to germany to be with him for a year. ted''s
    mother treated me like one of the family-in fact, she even kept my 100-pound dog
    during the year i was overseas. things didn''t work out and we didn''t marry.
    it was awkward for me to see his mother when i returned to the states, so we fell
    out of touch. for the last few years, i have been feeling very guilty. i never
    once offered to reimburse her for my dog''s food and vet bills, even though i

    recently my son''s clothing was stolen right off our clothesline in the back yard.
    sad to say, this wasn''t the first time this has happened. thieves used to steal
    when we had forgotten to take in the clothes before dark, so we made sure there
    were no clothes hanging outside before we went to bed. now, they steal in broad
    daylight! the last time this happened was a week ago. they stole a pair of elastic
    tights that my son and his sister shared-also a school sweatshirt. both of these
    items had my son''s name tag stitched in from when he went to summer camp. i know
    i will never see those clothes again. i hate to use my dryer-i save money when

    my boss and i have a $100 bet about the word "irregardless." i say it''s a word.
    he says it is not. when we looked it up in the dictionary, it said that "irregardless
    is non-standard," which my boss interprets as meaning it is not a word. i say
    that irregardless is a word, though perhaps not very proper. also, he says that
    "ain''t" isn''t a word; i say "ain''t" is a word because people say it, and it
    communicates a meaning, though it may not be proper. i am wondering if we should
    have defined "word" before we shook hands on this bet. what do you think? keep

    my eldest sister, "thelma," died of cancer last june. a short time before her

    how about you, young lady?" i could see that thelma was deeply offended. she knew
    she wasn''t young-she was 78 years old and had been fighting cancer for five years.
    she had lost all her hair because of the chemotherapy treatments and was very
    thin and frail. thelma had been a beauty until she fell ill. she was a talented
    artist and seamstress and had been active in community affairs. she refused to
    give up, and kept going until she just couldn''t go anymore. she made pretty scarves

    this concerns questioning the propriety of a telephone invitation to a wedding
    that came just two weeks before the event: i am sure many will join me in disagreeing
    with you. this is the very understandable system of the "a" list and the "b" list,
    not because of social order, but because of cost and family limitations. for example,
    when my son was married, his bride "allotted" him 27 guests. when some regrets
    came in, i immediately issued invitations by telephone, and most were accepted
    graciously. this past year, we received an invitation by phone from a dear friend
    who earlier had apologized for not including us in her limited number for her
    son''s wedding. it was 10 days before the wedding, and we were delighted to accept.
    my husband, in fact, joked that a 10-day notice meant they probably had a "z"

    i read with great interest the letter from the woman who, sparked by her upcoming
    20th high school reunion, was able to track down her high school sweetheart. luckily,
    she ended up getting engaged to him, and now has wedding bells in her future.
    many years ago during world war ii, when i was in england, i became friendly with
    an american airman. we shared not only friendship, but the dangers and uncertainties
    of war. as fate would have it, we were separated, and for nearly half a century
    we''ve had no communication. i married, raised a family, worked a job, and was
    too busy to dwell on that romantic interlude. now that i am alone again, i find
    myself thinking of him, wondering if he''s still alive, if his life has been happy,
    and wondering if he would like to hear from me. abby, do you think i should leave
    well enough alone, or should i go for it, so i can finally put the past to rest?
    i can''t sign my name, so i will sign it with the title of our favorite song .

    i am writing in regard to the letter from "needs to know," whose mother had recently
    been tattooed. (the husband of the tattooed woman was concerned that she had put
    them both at risk for aids with the tattooing process.) you replied that the centers
    for disease control had no recorded cases of hiv transmission from a tattoo needle.
    you then stated that transmission is theoretically possible, and that anyone being
    tattooed should question the artist about sterilization of needles and other skin-piercing
    instruments. i would like to add to that caution: i was tattooed about five years
    ago. i was in nursing school at the time, and felt i would be able to determine
    whether or not the artist properly sterilized his instruments. i was satisfied
    with the process he showed me. i now have my bachelor''s degree in nursing and
    have been practicing for a year and a half. i am also in the u.s. navy. the navy
    doctor who gave me my physical asked me point blank, "whatever were you thinking
    when you got that tattoo?" he went on to say that though i may have been satisfied
    with the sterilization of the needles and instruments, i should have been worried
    about the ink! "the ink," he said, "is very expensive, and it''s highly unlikely
    that all tattoo artists will discard the ink after tattooing each customer, and
    the ink could be contaminated by the blood." abby, this was something i had not
    even considered. the fact is, the hiv virus is very fragile, and would probably
    not have survived long in the ink, but of course, there is a slight possibility.
    please warn your readers that though sterilization of instruments may seem complete,
    they may have cause to worry about the ink. washington state r.n.'

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, my husband and i revisited the quaint
    european-style inn where we had spent our honeymoon. we had loved the place and
    found it very much as it was on our honeymoon, but there was one change that we
    did not care for, and we let them know about it when we checked out. in our room,
    we found an envelope with the following message: "in the custom of the old world
    inns, a pittance was a voluntary gesture of appreciation for tidy accommodations.
    your room has been carefully prepared by: louise and emma. thank you." the following
    morning, after our room had been made up, a second envelope was placed beside
    the first. this one was signed by "louise, emma and debbie." abby, we know that
    tipping is important to those who work in hotels; we have always rewarded good
    service with a generous tip, and we do not need to be reminded to leave "a pittance"
    for the maid. after we returned home, we received a letter from the owners of
    the inn. it read: "we recently began leaving tip envelopes for guests who wish
    to leave gratuities. we are trying to cope with the high turnover of maids. after
    studying the problem, we learned that generally, hotels have a higher turnover
    rate of chambermaids because most people do not want to make a career of housekeeping.
    thus far, the `tip envelope'' has been very successful. our staff is thrilled
    with the response from our guests, and it has been a major morale booster. "we
    carefully worded our message, using the words `voluntary pittance'' so the guests
    would know it was not required or demanded. we would appreciate your suggestions
    on how our message could be better presented." also, will you please review the
    rules for tipping at a hotel? an inn-grateful guest'

    a few years ago, i bumped into an old friend in a supermarket around holiday time.
    "what are you doing for christmas this year?" i asked. he replied, "every year,
    the wife and i take the money we would have spent on each other and we give a
    needy family a christmas tree, a christmas dinner with all the trimmings, toys
    for the kids, and gifts for the entire family. "last year, `our'' family had nine
    children, and it was the first christmas they had a tree." i thought it was a
    great idea and asked if i could help. he found another family that was down on
    their luck. it''s become my ritual. many people get depressed around the holidays.
    i never am, and when people ask me what i want for christmas, i say, "i''d like
    for some underprivileged family to have a good christmas . . . do you want to
    help?" i''m telling this story because all it took was a small seed planted in
    me to bring happiness to others. there are a lot of people who slip through the
    cracks, children who don''t receive toys from toys for tots, children whose names
    aren''t hanging on a christmas tree in a mall somewhere. i find these people through

    friends. how many couples living together today think that far ahead? social security

    allowing vulgarity, profanity and sexually explicit material in the movies and
    on tv to go unchallenged only weakens our country''s moral fiber and family unit.
    your recent survey showed that "67,783 readers felt many movies and tv shows today
    insult our values, intelligence and morals. only 213 readers disagreed." i asked
    my students (all 10-year-olds) to write a few sentences expressing how they feel
    about what they see and hear on tv and in the movies. i submit their comments.
    - mrs. jeanie owens, axtell elementary school i do not like the scenes that the
    tv stations put on the tv screens. all that kissing embarrasses me. - colt west
    what i see on tv embarrasses me when my cousins are watching tv with me. thank
    you for wanting my opinion. - kristin harris i don''t like dirty words on television.
    one day another girl asked me, "what does that mean?" it made me feel stupid.
    - natasha wilson i don''t think it''s right when some parents don''t know what
    their children are watching on tv. young children do not need to watch that filth.
    - jeremy bennett i am tired of dirty language on tv. i am also tired of the nasty
    videos. - catherine hernandez i wish there was at least one show that people of
    all ages and races could enjoy together. - lacy witt i think there is too much
    violence and cussing, but most of all it is embarrassing to kids when people kiss
    on tv. - laura lupu i disagree with the kissing and all the other mushy stuff
    on tv. - adam law i don''t like some of the fighting and killing on tv. it is
    just not nice. - alina tanasa i really hate the bad talking and kissing on television.
    - natalee dollins sometimes i get scared when i hear the news about kids killing
    kids in school. i wonder if these kids have been watching all the violence on
    television, and then try to copy it. i was always told by my parents that killing
    doesn''t make you a grownup. i was also told that to be a grownup, i am to treat
    others as i want to be treated. - johnathon doolet'

    you asked a reader: "if you had mice or cockroaches in your home, wouldn''t you
    want to be told?" you thought the hostess should be told. i disagree. here''s
    a true story to explain why: when i was about 16, i was sitting in my dad''s car
    waiting for him to come out of the hardware store, when i saw my girlfriend go
    into the store. she was wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. i couldn''t help but
    notice big rips in the seat of her pants. the hole was so big, her white underpants
    showed. a few minutes later, she came out of the store, holding her shirt down
    in the back very self-consciously. (someone must have told her about the hole
    in her pants.) when she saw me, she came over and said, "did you know i have a
    big hole in my pants?" i said, "really? i didn''t even notice it." she looked
    so relieved, and went home to change. the point of this story is: people don''t
    want cockroaches or mice any more than they want a hole in their pants. let them
    "save face" by believing nobody saw it. jansi sauer, east wenatchee, wash.'

    in early 1970, i wrote to you. i was 14 and pregnant. i wanted to give up the
    baby and needed information on homes for unwed mothers. you wrote back and gave
    me several options. my mother contacted the department of human services and a
    caseworker arranged for me to go to a place less than an hour from my home. i
    was away from july until november, a very lonely child. the baby''s father was
    my uncle, and our entire family suffered. i tried to keep my friends from finding
    out, but word got out and people still ask, "didn''t you have a baby years ago?"
    because i felt an extra responsibility to protect my reputation, i married right
    after high school. it lasted about two years. i later married a wonderful man
    and we had a boy and a girl. it lasted 12 years. i have been divorced three years,
    and i am content as a single mom. i put my children first and do not bring my
    dates home to meet them. my friends say this is silly, but it works for me. i
    have a good job and my life has worked out better than i ever thought it would.
    through the years i have written the department of human services for information
    on my daughter. i had them put a letter in her file so that if she tried to contact
    me she would have all the information. last week i was informed that the records
    on my daughter will not be opened unless it is a life-and-death situation. abby,
    i need to know if she is alive or dead. if she is alive, i will wait to see if
    she tries to contact me. if she is dead, then i can stop thinking about my phone
    ringing someday and that it might be her. where do you think i might go to locate
    her? i cannot afford a private detective or expensive legal proceedings. if you
    could suggest a group or agency that might be able to help, i would greatly appreciate
    it. i have never forgotten how you helped a little girl with comforting words
    and support when she needed it most. i will always remember you for that, and
    now, 22 years later, i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. -grateful

    major. if you''re reading this you''re still here. you can probably think of at
    least one person who isn''t around this year. (i know i can.) if you awakened
    this morning and were able to hear the birds sing, use your vocal cords to utter
    human sounds, read the newspaper with two good eyes (or even one)-praise the lord!
    a lot of people couldn''t. (say a prayer for those who have perished-from natural
    causes, fire, flood, earthquake or war.) how''s your pocketbook? thin? you''re
    not alone. but many people in much of the world are a lot poorer and have far
    less hope than we have in america. are you lonely? well, the way to have a friend
    is to reach out to someone and try to be a friend. if nobody calls you, call someone.
    go out of your way today to do something nice for another person. it''s a sure
    cure for the blues. are you concerned about your country''s future? hooray! our

    without fear of retribution. and for the first time, we are living in a unipolar
    world free from the threat of impending nuclear disaster. as a final thought,
    i''ll repeat my thanksgiving prayer. perhaps you will want to use it at your table
    tomorrow-let one of the children read it: "o, heavenly father, we thank thee for
    food and remember the hungry. "we thank thee for health and remember the sick.
    "we thank thee for friends and remember the friendless. "we thank thee for freedom
    and remember the enslaved. "may these remembrances stir us to service, "that thy
    gifts to us may be used for others. amen." may the spirit of thanksgiving be shared
    by one and all! have a wonderful thanksgiving, and may god bless you and yours.
    love, abby p.s. why not invite a friend who lives alone to share a thanksgiving
    meal, or better yet, call and say, "i''m coming to get you, and i''ll see that
    you get home." try it, and let me know how your day was. ---------- "keepers"

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    this story has been entered on the data base in 3 parts. this is part 1. ten years
    ago, trivial pursuit was born, and the games world has never been the same. trivial
    pursuit''s runaway success put dollars in the pockets of its inventors and dollar
    signs in the eyes of hundreds of game inventors who dreamed of similar glory.
    and some have enjoyed considerable success. the adult game category (as opposed
    to games for kiddies) has grown into a $200 million-a-year business, and americans
    buy more than 200 million games (including children''s games and puzzles) every
    year. and every year, more than 100 brand-new games hit the streets in anticipation
    of tapping into that lucrative market. most games fail. the vast majority of the
    games reviewed in this games issue won''t be available two years from now. just
    the fact that these games have made it to store shelves represents a victory of
    sorts; stores stock only what they think will sell, and even this year, when retailers
    are hopeful of a greatly improved christmas buying season (after the last two,
    just about anything would be an improvement), stores are very careful when it
    comes to allocating shelf space. this often leaves the independent, with little
    reputation and no advertising budget, out in the cold. it''s far safer for stores
    to stock games that are supported with tv advertising than to take a chance on
    a game with which no one is familiar. that''s where friday''s annual games issue
    comes in. every year, we go through piles of new games and write about them. we
    spot games that maybe some retailers don''t. we tell you about games that aren''t
    even stocked in chicago-area stores-and, in our manufacturer''s list (see index),
    tell you where to find those games. we put the best games in a special list; for
    years, that has been our top 20 list. this year, however, we cut that number down
    to a dozen; given the realities of the marketplace, a top 12 seemed like a more
    sensible number this year. you''ll find those games elsewhere in this issue (again,
    see index). but there are lots of other good games among the rest in our adult
    game category, which begins at the end of this article, to say nothing of the
    children''s games, puzzles, computer games, war games, role-playing games and
    video games reviewed elsewhere in this issue. how do we decide which games are
    best? we play them. every year, we pull up chairs, order some pizza and invite
    tribune staffers and friends to roll those dice. we record their opinions and
    their comments and take note of which games our players most enjoy. one thing
    we noticed about the games of 1992 is that there''s a lot less trivia. there are
    a few general-knowledge games, but not many. (in the first few years after trivial
    pursuit struck gold, trivia games dominated the retailing landscape.) but strategy
    games are strong-this year four out of 12 of our favorite games. and the recently
    concluded presidential campaign inspired several political games: candidate, road
    to the white house and risky strategy are all presidential-campaign games. we''ll
    tell you which plays best. and the best game of the year? that would be times
    to remember, a milton bradley game of famous events-and the dates they took place.
    it''s a trivia game, which bucks the trend this year, but it plays extremely well.
    this is the game we had trouble prying from the hands of some players. "five stars!"
    raved one of our game-testers; actually, we don''t rate games on a star system,
    but you get the idea. and now, the new games for 1992. first up: games for adults
    and families. check our index on this page for other games stories. prices listed
    are the manufacturer''s suggested retail price (or the general equivalent, such
    as double the wholesale price). when in doubt, we estimate high, so you should
    be able to find any game for no more than the price you see here; in many cases
    you''ll be able to find these games for quite a bit less. check our list of manufacturers
    (see index) if you can''t find a particular game in the stores. adultrivia ''90s
    version, tdc inc., $16. the outside of the box promises much: it looks for all
    the world like a set of trivia cards, with six color-coded categories (suitable
    for playing with you know what) of bawdy, sexually oriented questions. inside,
    however, are six color-coded booklets-much tougher to adapt to another format.
    but you still get lots of questions about the sex lives of famous people, napoleon''s
    privates (and we don''t mean his military subordinates) and other such bilge.
    adverteasing ii, cadaco, $25. this sequel to the successful adverteasing again
    asks players or teams to identify slogans, brand names and companies. questions
    are divided among three categories: slogans ("is it true blonds have more fun?"),
    trivia ("carnation milk comes from what kind of cows?") and clues ("1. beer; 2.
    milwaukee; 3. gusto"). there also are bonus questions, which pop up randomly in
    each category, that will challenge you, say, to name four brands of designer jeans.
    object is to collect five chips in each category; the only trouble is that there
    aren''t enough chips to go around for four players, and even two players will
    run short from time to time. other than that, we found the questions entertaining
    and fairly easy (there are even multiple-choice answers to most questions, though
    you earn fewer points if you use them). does that mean we watch too much tv? answers
    to the above questions: clairol, contented cows and schlitz-but you knew that,
    right? associations, benidee products, $35. this is a memory course in game form,
    not anything people would pick up just for fun. included is an 86-page book that
    teaches memory techniques; the game, in essence, is a practice device to put those
    associative memory techniques to use. the game board''s numbered squares direct
    players to answer corresponding, numbered questions; if you answer correctly,
    you gain control over that square. if another player lands on that square, that
    player must answer your question, so everyone has to pay attention to every question.
    each question includes some associative phrases players might use to recall the
    answer, but this doesn''t become useful until well into the game; it takes a long
    time before a previously asked question becomes difficult to remember. and the
    game isn''t good enough to sustain interest in anyone who isn''t actively trying
    to improve his or her memory. battle masters, milton bradley, $30. milton bradley
    has released a new tactical fantasy game, a successor to earlier series such as
    caesar and axis and allies. battle masters was designed in conjunction with well-known
    fantasy company games workshop, and the assistance shows in over 100 highly detailed
    playing and terrain pieces. game rules are simple and movement and combat are
    performed by drawing cards and rolling dice. the two players command the imperial
    and chaotic armies over a large plastic map board. the game is designed for players
    10 years old and older and appears designed as an introduction to games workshop''s
    more complicated fantasy and science fiction games. beat the competition, compete
    games, $29. players play sales rep in this strategy game, trying to land contracts
    while minimizing business expenses. moving about a board that''s a u.s. map, players
    make sales, earn bonuses and incentive trips; strategy involves staying "on the
    road" long enough to make lots of sales, yet have enough cash to make it back
    to the home office. our players found the game very realistic-perhaps overly so;
    a lighter approach to the sales game might have been more fun. the rules are a
    little complicated at first, but it''s an easy game to play once you get going.
    blackjack 21, john n. hansen, $48. practice for the chicago casino-if it ever
    gets here-by playing this realistic, palm-size electronic game. play is vegas-style;
    dealer stands on 17, hits on 16 or less-and for you alleged card-counters, the
    game uses a 52-card deck (and a display gives a signal when the cards are being
    reshuffled). the game is sophisticated enough to let you vary your bet, double
    down, split a pair or buy insurance. cute sound effects include snippets of "we''re
    in the money," and "happy days are here again," played at appropriate times-and
    yes, you can turn the sound off if you wish. california classics 2 go, mattel,
    $5. these are travel versions of public-domain games, such as backgammon and chinese
    checkers, packaged individually in vivid color to appeal to kids and teens. sturdily
    made and easy to handle. candidate, avalon hill, $19. a game of presidential primaries
    leading to the nomination of a presidential candidate. players participate in
    primaries across the nation, playing different types of cards to garner electoral
    votes that will lead to the nomination. naturally, along the way numerous dirty
    tricks may be played. with less than three pages of rules, candidate may be quickly
    learned and played in a couple of hours. however, although entertaining, the game
    does not lend a great deal of the flavor of american presidential politics. careers,
    tiger games, $13. this classic game has been redesigned and pushed, somewhat,
    into the ''90s. play is the same as before: each player must accumulate 60 points,
    divided among fame, fortune and happiness categories (each player determines how
    much of each to pursue), by entering any of several careers. the careers are a
    bit different than before; now, for instance, players can try careers in ecology
    (little fame or money available, but lots of happiness), computer science (big
    risks, big rewards) or sports (big-bucks for a lucky few, not much for most).
    attractive design, good components. couples, hunzicker enterprises, $8. not very
    many inventors boast that their game takes a year to play, but couples is a different
    sort of game. it''s a game of romance, played by a married couple, and consists
    of a spiral-bound book detailing 52 weekly contests in which both spouses must
    do nice things, or avoid "unnice" things; the loser has to pay a consequence.
    for instance, contest 16: each partner plans a romantic date for the weekend;
    the partner who comes up with the least romantic date pays for the pizza and movie
    rental on sunday night. or, contest 33: score a point each time you catch your
    mate complaining this week. loser must take the winner to dinner and try a food
    she or he ordinarily dislikes. at the end of the year, the overall loser must
    take the winner on a four-day vacation of the winner''s choice. a cute idea for
    young marrieds, perhaps. cribbgolf, jk games, $40. a game that combines cribbage
    and golf; knowledge of the rudiments of both games is needed, but instruction
    is provided. game is played on a pegboard whose holes correspond to movement along
    a golf course. to oversimplify, you play cribbage with the deck of cards (provided)
    and each point translates into one peghole of movement; advancing to or beyond
    the pin completes that hole. attractive board. dark world, mattel, $28. this is
    an introductory-level fantasy battle game designed for one to five players. one
    group of players assumes the roles of heroes attempting to capture a castle controlled
    by the evil korak, who is apparently a pretty bad guy with lousy taste in interior
    decorating. the opposing player controls korak and his evil minions who attempt
    to waste the intruding adventurers. this is another simple fantasy combat game,
    but the playing pieces and components of the castle are first-rate. all and all,
    this is a pretty cool game, designed for players 10 and older.'

    some time ago, i was in a large drugstore with my infant son. there was a woman
    in the store with two boys who looked to be about 3 and 6 years old. the older
    boy took a couple of steps away from his mother and, in a small voice, asked a
    clerk, "do you have any toys?" his mother yanked him to her and shook him roughly
    by his neck, yelling at him and using a lot of filthy language. the other boy
    just stood by quietly, while his brother cried. this made the mother angrier,
    so she continued to shake him. i was stunned. my heart ached and i wanted to cry.
    there were other people who saw this, but nobody did anything. if that woman could

    opened, we''ve people park in our yard, climb the fence, pet the horses, feed
    them candy, jump up and down on the fence, break branches off our trees and shake
    them at the horses. one day i found a stranger pitching hay over my fence. he
    said he thought the horses looked hungry. have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?
    another day, a young mother sat her 15-month-old child on the fence (with the
    child''s legs inside) and both were patting my horse on the head. abby, an animal

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    you''ve gone cold turkey. the specials and celebrity fables like "sinatra" that
    glutted television viewers for the latest key ratings period are memories. as
    you muffle a discreet belch and return to a diet of your regular favorites, it
    may be wise to start the grieving process early for tottering series-and to ponder
    the axiom that excellence and television tend to be mutually exclusive. "i''ll
    fly away," nbc''s much-honored but little-watched series set in the 1950s south,
    has become a personal crusade for john falsey, its creator with joshua brand.
    he has stumped in interviews for the friday drama, which he insists is the best
    on tv. falsey also won a 45-minute hearing last week with nbc entertainment chief
    warren littlefield to make his case. the network knows the prestige value of such
    an award-winning series. it also knows how much flak cbs took when it yanked the
    similarly beloved, low-rated "brooklyn bridge." "cbs, they had to do what they
    had to do," said preston beckman, programming vice president for nbc. "we realize
    canceling shows like `i''ll fly away'' has repercussions." nbc joined the series''
    producers in running newspaper ads in 10 cities enlisting viewers in the cause.
    it''s clear that without a quick surge in ratings, "i''ll fly away" will die this
    season. beckman says the "verdict''s still out" on norman lear''s political family
    sitcom, "the powers that be," and mentioned unhappiness with the showing of another
    comedy, "a different world." but he insists that the network is trying to practice
    the virtue of patience, giving series a fair shake. "this year, we made a concerted
    effort not to order a lot of backup shows," he said. "the normal reaction is,
    `we can do better. the next show will be better.'' . . . but replacement shows
    don''t necessarily do better." tell that to abc, which emerged no. 1 in the november
    ratings sweeps, one of four periods each year used to help local stations set
    advertising rates. cbs was second, nbc third. abc has turned a steely eye on three
    struggling series: sophomores "civil wars" and "homefront," and the new "going
    to extremes." the network "will have to take a hard look at them in the next couple
    weeks," spokesman jim brochu said. the uneven "going to extremes," with a cast
    of freshfaced med students and an exotic caribbean location, is from the brand-falsey
    team responsible for cbs'' popular "northern exposure," as well as "i''ll fly
    away." falsey said the series suffered from hype that made it out as a tropical
    companion piece to the whimsical "exposure." the two returning dramas "had not
    performed all that great, performed so-so last year," brochu said. "we brought
    them back in hopes they would grow in the second year." for "homefront," an ensemble
    drama set in post-world war ii america, even an enthusiastic boost from dear abby
    didn''t help: the show has fared poorly in the nielsens, placing 71st in a recent
    outing. could dedicated fans be left adrift, never to know the fate of the lemo
    tomato juice girl and her baseball-playing beau of the lemo all-stars? "civil
    wars," a divorce lawyer drama starring the generally clothed mariel hemingway,
    failed to get a sustained bounce from an early fall debut and a tame nude scene
    featuring the statuesque actress. cbs already dropped the ax on its saturday night
    lineup, including "brooklyn bridge." but it claims to be standing pat elsewhere,
    good news-for now-for viewers trying to avoid separation anxiety.'

    regarding the woman who was having a cocktail party and preferred that her guests
    not wear fur: i''m tired of these anti-fur people. i would ask her the following:
    are your guests allowed to wear belts or shoes? may they drive to your home in
    a car with leather interiors? do you have leather furniture in your home? and
    will you be serving meat of any kind? (do you eat meat?) when these anti-fur activists
    quit eating meat and using any by-products from the killing of animals, then and
    only then can they protest killing animals for their fur. mona arce, covina, calif.'

    one of the toughest tasks a church faces is choosing a good minister. a member
    of an official board undergoing this painful process finally lost patience. he''d
    watched the pastoral relations committee reject applicant after applicant for
    some fault, alleged or otherwise. it was time for a bit of soul-searching on the
    part of the committee. so he stood up and read a letter purporting to be from
    another applicant. "gentlemen: understanding your pulpit is vacant, i should like
    to apply for the position. i have many qualifications. i''ve been a preacher with
    much success and also have had some success as a writer. some say i''m a good
    organizer. i''ve been a leader most places i''ve been. "i''m over 50 years of
    age. i have never preached in one place for more than three years. in some places,
    i have left town after my work caused riots and disturbances. i must admit i have
    been in jail three or four times, but not because of any real wrongdoing. "my
    health is not too good, though i still get a great deal done. the churches i have
    preached in have been small, though located in several large cities. "i''ve not
    gotten along well with religious leaders in towns where i have preached. in fact,
    some have threatened me and even attacked me physically. i am not too good at
    keeping records. i have been known to forget whom i baptized. "however, if you
    can use me, i shall do my best for you." the board member looked over the committee.
    "well, what do you think? shall we call him?" the good church folks were aghast.
    call an unhealthy, trouble-making, absentminded ex-jailbird? was the board member
    crazy? who signed the application? who has such colossal nerve? the board member
    eyed them all keenly before he answered, "it''s signed, `the apostle paul."'''

    from pneumonia. before ray died, he made me promise to tell our grandparents exactly
    what he died from. it was his last wish. he begged me to fulfill it, and i said
    i would. it''s been more than a year and i still haven''t told them the truth,

    you recently printed a letter from a doctor''s wife who complained about patient
    phone calls to his home. my father was a small-town lawyer who frequently was
    interrupted at home with non-emergency calls from clients, friends and relatives-usually
    seeking free legal advice. one neighbor was particularly disruptive, calling two
    or three times a week. one evening, my father had come home early from a social
    engagement to find that this neighbor had called four times during the evening
    and had left a message for my father to return his call as soon as he came in.
    dad stretched, yawned and set his alarm for 3:30 a.m., and then went to bed. at
    3:30 a.m., he got up and returned the call, saying, "i just got home and i am
    returning your call-i knew it had to be something urgent for you to have telephoned
    my home so many times. what can i do for you?" guess who never called dad at home

    laughed at for crying when prettyboy, his parakeet, died. people would say, "it
    was only a bird." i''m a 24-year-old man. two years ago i moved to california.
    in my fully packed car, i brought my mother and poobo-my 4-foot boa constrictor.
    i''d had poobo for 3 1/2 years. i moved into a warehouse in oakland. it was great,
    except it was very cold inside, and boa constrictors need at least 75-degree temperatures.
    i couldn''t come up with a way to keep poobo warm and he died of pneumonia. i
    found him during my lunch break from work. i cried so hard, i couldn''t return
    to work that day. when i went back to my job, i was depressed and teary-eyed and
    people would say, "it was only a snake; how can you cry over a snake?" abby, i''d
    had poobo since he was a baby. i watched him grow. i could tell when he was hungry
    or in a bad mood. if i left him for too long, he would "pout" and refuse to come
    near me. he had feelings just like any other pet. i still get a lump in my throat
    when i think of him. i''ve had snakes as pets all my life, but after losing poobo,
    i don''t think i''ll get another one. losing him was too hard on me. so, david,
    cry all you want over prettyboy. real friends will understand what you''re going

    for christmas, i don''t want another crystal bud vase. i have four under my kitchen
    sink, and nobody brings me flowers anyway. i don''t want a sausage and cheese
    tray-too much cholesterol for this old lady. i don''t want another music box to
    find a place for. i have too many now. i don''t want a silk nightgown, perfumed
    soap, bed jacket, dusting powder or bird feeder. what do i want? ask me. i''m
    not shy. i''ve told you already, but i never got it. maybe this time i will. i
    want you to give me a few hours. take me and my cumbersome wheelchair to the mall;
    i''d love to see the lights and hear the music. drive me around town so i can
    see the christmas decorations-then maybe stop for hot cocoa. i''d like a book
    of postage stamps, a writing tablet with lines and some plain envelopes. i would
    also appreciate a decent ballpoint pen and some telephone coupons so i can make
    a few long-distance calls to people i will probably never see again. i''d really
    appreciate a visit from you and other family members-especially my grandchildren
    who call and say, "hi, grandma. how are you? i love you. gotta go. see you later.
    bye!" i''d like someone to offer to pay my heating bill for one month. (with five
    sons, six daughters and 42 grandchildren, that shouldn''t be so hard to do.) and
    i sure wish someone would come over and test my smoke alarm. i love you all. that''s
    why i feel free to tell you what is on my mind. grandma'

    i have always believed that when a woman gets married for the first time, she
    is entitled to wear a white wedding gown. it''s a symbol of her virginity, right?
    nowadays, a girl can live with her boyfriend for a year, or two, or three-there
    is no ceiling-and if she decides she wants a church wedding, she buys herself
    a white wedding gown with a veil, and nobody says a word. why? i know a young
    woman who has had two children out of wedlock with two different men. she wanted
    a church wedding with a white wedding gown, she even had her kids take part in
    the ceremony. nobody stopped her. why? maybe i am just a stupid, old-fashioned
    man, but when did all the rules change? in both of the above cases, those girls
    were no more virgins than i am. abby, has the original meaning of a white wedding

    he proceeded to laugh and make a joke of it when he discovered that he broke my
    couch! the couch was only a year and a half old, and there was no reason for him
    to plop himself down that hard. i asked him to replace the couch. at first he
    agreed, then he changed his mind and said he had spoken to his lawyer and was
    told that he was not responsible for replacing it. i then talked to a lawyer myself,
    and he told me that i had grounds to take the man to small claims court because
    guests are responsible for damage, as they are obligated to show reasonable care
    for other people''s property. abby, what do you think i should do? take him to

    during the holidays, blood banks around the country face the task of providing
    transfusions for the many hospital patients who depend on our community blood
    supply. the need is so great, and you have been such a stalwart friend, abby,
    that we are asking you to remind your readers once again that the need for blood
    never takes a holiday. perhaps you can also remind your readers that giving blood
    is safe: you can''t get aids or any other disease from giving blood! it''s simple
    and usually takes 30 to 40 minutes from registration through post-donation juice
    and crackers. and, most important, giving blood saves lives. last year, more than
    4 million americans received blood transfusions. sadly, only about 5 percent of
    those able to donate actually give blood. here in the dallas-ft. worth area, we
    need more than 700 units of blood every day, including christmas and new year''s.
    abby, americans have so many blessings to celebrate. why not celebrate the blessings
    of good health by sharing it? this holiday season, visit your local blood center
    and give the gift that lasts a lifetime: give blood. william f. heller, carter

    new year''s resolutions are based on the original credo of al-anon. i have taken

    i will live through this day only, and not set far-reaching goals to try to overcome
    all my problems at once. i know i can do something for 24 hours that would appall
    me if i thought i had to keep it up for a lifetime. just for today i will be happy.
    abraham lincoln said, "most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds
    to be." he was right. i will not dwell on thoughts that depress me. i will chase
    them out of my mind and replace them with happy thoughts. just for today i will
    adjust myself to what is. i will face reality. i will correct those things that
    i can correct and accept those things i cannot correct. just for today i will
    improve my mind. i will not be a mental loafer. i will force myself to read something
    that requires effort, thought and concentration. just for today i will do something
    positive to improve my health. if i''m a smoker, i''ll make an honest effort to
    quit. if i''m overweight, i''ll eat nothing i know to be fattening. and i will
    force myself to exercise - even if it''s only walking around the block or using
    the stairs instead of the elevator. just for today i''ll do something i''ve been
    putting off for a long time. i''ll finally write that letter, make that phone
    call, clean that closet or straighten out those dresser drawers. just for today
    before i speak i will ask myself, "is it true? is it kind?" and if the answer
    to either of those questions is negative, i won''t say it. just for today i will
    make a conscious effort to be agreeable. i will look as good as i can, dress becomingly,
    talk softly, act courteously and not interrupt when someone else is talking. just
    for today i''ll not try to improve anybody except myself. just for today i will
    have a program. i may not follow it exactly, but i will have it, thereby saving
    myself from two pests: hurry and indecision. just for today i will gather the
    courage to do what is right and take the responsibility for my own actions. to
    one and all: a happy, healthy new year! love, abby p.s. god bless our men and

    i am a senior citizen living on a fixed income. i did a very foolish thing - i
    gave my visa number over the phone to a person who was calling from las vegas
    about a "contest" i had entered. the prize was $5,000. i did not ask, nor was
    i told, what the product was, and how much it was going to cost me to win the
    $5,000. (to a pensioner, that kind of money looks pretty good, but i should have
    known better.) the man told me that the product was a vitamin program that would
    do much to improve my health. the cost was $800! i immediately asked him to cancel
    it, as i could not afford that kind of money. he was very insistent, and asked
    if i was the recipient of the $5,000 award, could i not afford it then? he harassed
    me over the phone for a week, after which i handed the phone to my daughter -
    who told him that i was not interested. he still would not take no for an answer.
    i then handed the phone to my husband who also told him no. he still insisted.
    we tried to stop payment on my visa, but they could do nothing about it. this
    person also had a girl telephone our home and ask for me. we recognized her voice
    from previous phone calls. my family finally told him not to call again, and thank
    god, he hasn''t so far. abby, please warn others to find out what they are paying
    for before they give any numbers over the telephone. i learned the hard way. you

    your advice to "tough decision," who had made a deathbed promise to his brother,
    "ray," to tell their grandparents that ray was gay and had died of aids, was a
    bummer. in the first place, if ray had wanted his grandparents to know that he
    was gay and was dying of aids, he should have told them himself; he had plenty
    of time. it was unfair of ray to lay that kind of burden on his brother. abby,
    you told "tough decision," "you made a deathbed promise to your brother, and you
    owe it to him to keep your promise. the truth never hurt anyone - only lies hurt."
    bull! you came up with a trite parable of an answer. "tough decision" made his
    own best analysis: "ray is gone now, and revealing the truth isn''t going to bring
    him back, and i hate to hurt our grandparents by revealing something like that."
    who said deathbed promises are sacred and must be honored at all costs? and where
    did you learn that the truth never hurt anybody? deathbed promises are made in
    times of stress, and they are not necessarily binding. then you went on to say
    that ray had his reasons for wanting his grandparents to know that he was gay.
    that is ridiculous! what good would it do their grandparents to know? it would
    only hurt them. charles piper, rancho palos verdes'

    i was involved in the most incredible incident, and i am at a loss as to what
    to do. i purchased some books in early august, including a favorite children''s
    book, to give to my daughter as a baby shower gift. when i returned home, i paged
    through this book and discovered a handwritten inscription, "1992 - happy second
    birthday, carrie. love, aunt mary." now, this is the unbelievable part: i purchased
    (and autographed) that very same book at a different bookstore last may! apparently
    my friend (carrie''s mother) returned it to the bookstore that i visited in august.
    after sharing this unusual experience with the assistant manager and getting quite
    a chuckle, i decided to keep the book. after all, i paid for the same book twice!
    (i might add that the assistant manager was very embarrassed that this same inscribed
    volume had made it to the sale floor.) should i tell my friend about this ironic
    incident? she loves to hear about unusual coincidences, yet i don''t want to embarrass
    her with the knowledge that i found out she had returned the book. please advise
    soon. you may print this. she never reads you. aunt mary'

    americans are crazy. don''t you realize nature gave us hair for protection? women

    i''m a nurse practitioner in a college health setting. yearly i struggle with
    getting the message to students that sexually transmitted diseases (stds) are
    present on campuses across the nation. a healthy sense of vulnerability is good
    for all of us, regardless of age. perhaps you would understand if i relate a few
    situations: 1. a young woman with a pelvic infection so severe that she must be
    hospitalized comes to the health center. even with iv antibiotics, there is no
    guarantee that her fallopian tubes are not already irreparably damaged. her fear:
    her parents find out she''s having sexual relations. mine: she may never conceive
    a child or may have tubal pregnancies due to scarring. 2. a young man brings his
    girlfriend to the health center with sores in the genital area. i''ve treated
    him for genital herpes in the past - he must tell her that. confidentiality must
    be honored. i cannot and will not disclose to her that i know him. 3. a young
    man calls, asking to be seen immediately. he''s just learned that a young female
    student with whom he had unprotected sex is dead. rumor is that she developed
    an aids-related opportunistic infection. (it''s true.) his hiv test is negative,
    but what will subsequent tests show? 4. a young woman with a previous history
    of psychological problems loses touch with reality. her illness involves acting
    out sexually. over a 48-hour period, she has sexual contact with 20 male students.
    5. two freshman roommates have their first gynecological exam. one learns she
    is pregnant. several days later, the other learns she has hpv (the genital wart
    virus) on her cervix. all of these students thought it could never happen to them.
    they''re not ignorant, irresponsible, uncaring or promiscuous. often, the individual
    has had only one sexual partner - ever. often the ordinarily cautious person gets
    into a bad situation because alcohol has reduced his or her inhibitions. these
    students don''t come from deprived backgrounds. their parents are doctors, lawyers,
    nurses, ministers, teachers, social workers, government employees, and many (if
    not a majority) are from two-parent families. sorry to be so long-winded, abby,
    but these young people are our future. college health care worker'

    that had to take precedence over our love. for the next 40 years, my old love
    was never very far from my mind, even though i had no idea whether he was dead
    or alive. then, recently, in an unbelievable stroke of fate, we met face to face,
    and all the intensity of our feelings for each other came flooding back. sounds

    received a long-distance telephone call at home. it was a voice from out of the

    to inquire about bill''s marital status-maybe hoping he was also alone, and they
    could take up where they had left off many years ago. can you imagine the nerve?
    bill was practically tongue-tied, but he told her politely that he had been very
    much married for a good many years. i realize that times have changed, and women
    are much more aggressive these days and anything goes, but calling a man at his

    neither did i until five years ago when alice parenti of fresno, calif., wrote
    to tell me about it. this is the week. if you are a card-carrying member of the
    human race, there is at least one person in your life who needs your forgiveness.
    or perhaps it''s you who needs to be forgiven, so hop aboard the mea culpa bandwagon,
    let go of those grudges and give your ulcer a chance to heal. robert muller, former
    assistant secretary-general of the united nations, wrote this lovely piece especially
    for international forgiveness week: decide to forgive decide to forgive for resentment
    is negative resentment is poisonous resentment diminishes and devours the self.
    be the first to forgive, to smile and to take the first step. and you will see
    happiness bloom on the face of your human brother or sister. be always the first
    do not wait for others to forgive for by forgiving you become the master of fate
    the fashioner of life the doer of miracles. to forgive is the highest, most beautiful
    form of love. in return you will receive untold peace and happiness. here is the
    program for achieving a truly forgiving heart: sunday: forgive yourself. monday:
    forgive your family. tuesday: forgive your friends and associates. wednesday:
    forgive across economic lines within your own nation. thursday: forgive across
    cultural lines within your own nation. friday: forgive across political lines
    within your own nation. saturday: forgive other nations. only the brave know how
    to forgive. a coward never forgives. it is not in his nature. now, dear readers,
    if you will forgive me for repeating a portion of the lovely poem titled "forgiveness,"
    by george roemisch, here it is: "forgiveness is the fragrance of the violet that
    clings fast to the heel that crushed it." so, if perchance you are the "heel"
    that crushed a violet, this is the week to seek forgiveness. ---------- this is

    a few suggestions for "hurt," whose neighbor didn''t invite her to thanksgiving
    dinner, but invited her for leftovers the next day. as the popular tv commercial
    says, "get back into life!" i''m also a widow; my neighbors still have their husbands.
    i have no children, and my siblings live clear across the country. friends and
    neighbors are kind and caring, but hey, they have their own lives. if you''re
    lonely, so are a lot of other people. start thinking about them instead of yourself
    - how about your having a dinner and inviting them over? if you can''t afford
    to feed a gang, make it potluck. if that idea doesn''t appeal to you, or your
    apartment is too small, how about volunteering to help serve holiday dinners for
    the needy or homeless? there are all sorts of organizations for widowed people.
    sure beats sitting around moping and whining. after you lose your mate, your life
    will change, and it will never be the same again - so make a new one, and make
    it as good as you possibly can. please sign me . . . alone but not lonely in denver'

    a recent letter in your column from "teenage twin" brought back memories of my
    youth as an identical twin. my brother and i both experienced the frustration
    of relatives who couldn''t (or wouldn''t take the time to) tell us apart. in our
    early teens, we decided to get our revenge at the next family gathering. whenever
    we were called by the wrong name or referred to as "whichever one you are," we
    would respond politely and with total respect - but with a totally incorrect name.
    so, if aunt ruth asked for the sugar bowl, we''d pass it to her saying, "here
    you are, aunt mary." if uncle fred wanted the footstool, we''d get it and ask,
    "need anything else, uncle bob?" this only occurred a few times until people began
    to realize what we were doing. nobody''s feelings were hurt, and we got our point
    across. soon all our relatives began calling us by our correct names. even today,
    my brother and i still start the "name game" at family gatherings. it never fails
    to bring back wonderful and funny memories. the "other one" in columbus'

    is thy lifelong companion. - abuse not thy body with excessive food, tobacco,
    drink, or any foreign substance that goeth into thy arm or up thy nose. - do not
    forget that cleanliness is a virtue. - permit neither thy business nor thy hobby
    to make thee a stranger to thy children, for the most precious gift a parent can
    give a family is time. - make not a beggar of thy mate. willingly share with him
    or her thy worldly goods. - forget not to say, "i love you." for even though thy
    love may be constant, thy mate doth yearn to hear those cherished words. - remember
    that the approval of thy mate is worth far more than the adoring glances of a
    hundred strangers, so cleave unto thy mate, and forsake all others. - keep thy
    home in good repair, for out of it cometh the joys of old age (not to mention

    sentimental value. i was disgruntled to learn that ups, contrary to its verbal
    assurance of making three delivery attempts before returning the package to its
    center, made only one delivery attempt, then left the parcel with a neighbor who
    was a complete stranger. the parcel was stolen. this unwritten policy of the ups
    is in stark contrast with our experience with the u.s. postal service, which appears
    to retain responsibility for delivery of parcels until other arrangements can
    be made. although our loss is irreplaceable, we''d gain satisfaction if our mishap
    can help others avoid similar problems. until ups changes its unwritten policy,

    i''m writing to you at a lonely and vulnerable time. i have been widowed for almost
    a year. i know there are legions of widows - and many of us do not drive. consequently,
    i rely on friends and relatives to drive me on my errands. on most occasions,
    when i ask for assistance, they usually agree if they have no prior commitment.
    but not once do they ever extend an invitation to go for a nice sunday drive,
    or even on a weekend trip, although they boast of doing these things with other
    friends, or even by themselves. i think this is so inconsiderate and selfish.
    what do you think? don''t advise me to learn to drive - since my husband''s death,
    i''ve sold the car and have no intention of purchasing another one. living on
    a limited income now does not allow me this luxury. i''m not broke, but i''m not
    rolling in money. michigan widow'

    my husband of 11 years reads dirty magazines. i keep finding them under our bed,

    so if i''m not in the mood when he is, he can wear out the pages looking-it''s
    harmless. last week, i found a letter in his briefcase thanking him for his interest
    in a "swapping" club. there were pictures and videos of sexy-looking girls. one
    was saying, "i''m roxanne, i''m 38-24-36" etc. it gave me an inferiority complex.
    no way can i compare with these sexy-looking women. when i questioned my husband
    about the swapping club, he said he inquired only out of curiosity and didn''t
    plan to commit himself to anything. where do i draw the line, abby? do i have
    to go along with this? he says it will improve our sex lives to indulge in some
    fantasies. we are new in this community, and my neighbor told me that she was

    you won''t believe this one. my husband and i are in our 60s and recently retired.
    all during our marriage, my husband snored loudly. this kept me awake and i would

    an entire night together. my husband was very understanding and didn''t seem to
    mind this arrangement. he claimed that i snored too, but it didn''t bother him
    - he could sleep right through it. (i didn''t believe him, but i didn''t say anything.)
    abby, i drank three cups of coffee a day. my husband didn''t usually drink coffee,

    that if he drank even one cup of coffee for breakfast, he would complain the next
    morning that my snoring kept him awake. abby, how can that be? when he drank coffee,
    i snored? i decided to try an experiment: i stopped drinking coffee entirely.
    guess what? my husband stopped snoring! of course, the truth is obvious: he still
    snores, and i suppose i do, too, but it was the caffeine that kept me awake -

    if malcolm forbes were alive, he would be on the phone to you as a friend and

    since he isn''t alive, may i express my feelings? bikers come in all sizes, ages
    and walks of life. we raise money for charities, teach rider safety in schools,
    pay property taxes, gas taxes, street taxes and insurance. we are good citizens.
    we care for our safety, that of our passengers, and the non-riding public. we
    ride for a variety of reasons, and our feelings about this pastime are strong
    and valid. i think you owe motorcycle riders an apology for what appears to be
    an insensitive public statement, and an apparent stereotype with which we have
    been labeled. if a child or an adult admires (or wishes to sit on) my bike in
    my presence in a parking lot, it''s my pleasure to be an ambassador of understanding
    about the equipment and responsibilities that come with owning and operating a
    motorcycle. i''ll bet all of us feel this responsibility. how about a second look?

    i was surprised to see that you agreed with "long islander," who wanted obituaries
    to state whether persons who had died of lung cancer had been habitual smokers.
    in the first place, an obituary is hardly the place to chastise the deceased for
    self-destructive habits. secondly, if we are going to use death notices as object
    lessons, what about other unhealthy vices? shouldn''t obituaries read: "harry
    gave himself a heart attack because he salted everything he ate, and he never
    met a fried food he didn''t like"? or, "jane''s death from skin cancer was brought
    on by her 30-year quest for the perfect tan"? abby, i''m sure you wouldn''t approve
    of using such remarks in an obituary, yet you seem to encourage using the fact
    that a person had been a habitual smoker in that person''s obituary because it
    supports your personal anti-smoking campaign. in case you''re wondering, i have
    never used tobacco in any form, but i can understand why smokers resent being
    singled out for public abuse. in your column, you keep reminding people to show
    compassion and understanding for alcoholics and drug addicts, but nicotine addicts
    (for you)are fair game. why? perhaps those who have a public forum - such as yourself

    the company is now advertising it, and will make this recipe available to the

    our recipe, nor did it compensate us for it. the contest rules stated that all
    entries selected became the property of the company. i think we should write to
    this company and protest its use of our recipe without our permission, and also

    force are "officers," really got me mad. when are people going to quit picking
    on the police? not only do they get blamed for everything under the sun, now mr.
    padwick declares they are not worthy of the title "officer" - after so many of
    them busted their tails to earn a badge. get a life, mr. padwick! my husband is
    a police officer - and a good one! he puts his life on the line every time he
    walks out the door. sure, he writes tickets and takes those who deserve it to
    jail, but he also helps pull people out of wrecked cars and holds wounded people
    in his arms until the ambulance gets there - and he comforts the loved ones of
    those who are critically injured or dead. he works on sundays and holidays, and
    has missed his own children''s birthdays and our anniversaries. you bet my husband
    is an officer, and for your information, mr. padwick, my dictionary''s definition
    is similar to abby''s - only hers says, "one charged with police duties," and
    mine says, "one performing police duties," which could mean if you called "911"
    in an emergency for which you needed an officer, they wouldn''t send a "captain"
    to your house - they would probably send a plain, ordinary police officer. a police

    i couldn''t help but laugh when i read the letter from the woman who said her
    laundry had been stolen from her clothesline-right in her back yard. we have two
    adult cats who live in our back yard and sleep on the lawn furniture on our deck.
    they are affectionate pets, and we love them. lately, they have been stealing
    small items of clothing (boys'' underwear, socks, small stuffed toys, rags, etc.)
    and leaving them on our lawn furniture on our deck. we have no idea why our cats
    have become kleptomaniacs; they are healthy, well-fed, neutered and spayed male
    and female cats. they began this "off" behavior a few months ago. will you please

    while driving on a very busy highway, i hit a raccoon. being an animal lover,
    this upset me so much, i cried all the way home. what should i have done in that
    situation? should i have stopped and checked to see if the animal was still alive?
    and if i had done that, and the animal had been still alive, i would have had
    to locate an animal shelter-or hospital in the next town-which would have taken

    the letter from the lady who was offended by the jocular use of the term "brain

    - at least in some contexts. i concluded that there are very few - if any - things
    said in jest that would not be offensive to someone, somewhere, at some time.
    likewise, who among us is completely without at least one sensitive spot? i wonder
    if a society that personalizes everything isn''t in danger of becoming humorless.
    for example: i happen to be bald. i really wish i weren''t, but there is a lot
    of good, clean humor on the subject of bald men. i can live with that. if we lose
    the ability to laugh at ourselves, can insanity be far behind? putting it another

  body: 'Dear Ethicist,


    i''m a retired woodshop teacher having taught in the public school system for
    27 years. there were some medical problems in my family, so i moonlighted for
    16 years as a policeman - city police, sheriff''s department and university police.
    while i was growing up, my parents were the final authority. in fact, i would
    rather have faced the police than my dad. if i got into trouble, his thinking
    was, "they didn''t just decide to pick on my son for no reason. he must have done
    something to get their attention." that was enough to cause my dad concern about
    my conduct. this type of authority has changed drastically in our society. if
    a child gets into trouble, his parents usually become allies with him against
    all forms of authority - police, schools, courts, etc. by not publishing the names
    of juveniles, a record is allowed to build and attitudes to develop. the family
    and young lawbreaker become anonymous, and the crimes become more frequent and
    violent. when the child gets old enough to be charged as an adult, everybody wonders,
    "when did he start going wrong?" the truth is, he had been going wrong for a long
    time but he was sheltered. it started when he stole the first piece of candy from
    the grocery store. he was just a 7-year-old kid, so it was "no big deal." it started
    again when he stole another kid''s bike - then it was probably just a "mistake."
    it started when he was underage and drunk - "oh, that was just a part of growing
    up." it started when he forced a neighbor girl into a situation she didn''t really
    want, and it was probably just a "misunderstanding." students used to tell me
    that they could do almost anything except murder until they were 18, and it wouldn''t
    matter because at 18, they would get a clean slate. i tried to explain to them
    that you can''t change an attitude that has developed during your first 18 years.
    i''ve always felt that if the parents or the single parent who is raising a child
    will not accept the responsibility for that child''s acts or actions, the parent(s)
    should be forced by law to take responsibility. you cannot legally publish the
    names of juveniles in the newspapers, but you could certainly publish the names
    of the parents. example: "the young son of mr. and mrs. john doe was found guilty
    of beating up an 80-year-old woman and robbing her of $3." i say, if you cannot
    charge the juvenile - charge the parents! this may help bring child crime down.
    however, it may increase what may now be termed as "child abuse" - there may be
    a few warm little butts around. and the 80-year-old lady may have a little less
    to worry about in the future. thanks, abby, for letting me have my say. don banks,
    fort collins, colo.'

    twenty-seven years ago, i gave my firstborn up for adoption. i was 17, unmarried,
    and sent to a "home" where i was told i had no alternative. i signed a piece of
    paper stating that i was giving my son away of my own free will, but now i realize
    i was manipulated. i have suffered tremendous guilt. even though i married and
    have other children who have brought me great joy, no one can replace my firstborn.
    when my son turned 18, i began my search, and after eight years, i found him.
    i wrote him letters, sent pictures, and have also corresponded with his adoptive
    parents. i''ve spoken to him on the telephone, but he doesn''t want to meet me.
    his adoptive parents still have fears that i will take him away, which is absurd
    - and he feels that he owes them his loyalty. my son has married but has no children.
    his wife is far more receptive to meeting me than he is. (i dream of "surprising"
    him one day.) i have wonderful children and a busy, fulfilling life - but i will
    never feel complete until i can put my arms around my firstborn. is there anything
    i can say or do to change his mind? please pray for me. unfinished chapter'

    once in a while i read a love story in your column, usually from a couple who

    years ago, following a painful divorce, i enrolled in a square dance class. the
    caller (teacher) said that every year there had been marriages as a result of
    people meeting there. i didn''t find a husband, but i had a lot of fun and met
    some nice people. then i dropped out. last october, a neighbor encouraged me to
    enroll in another square dance class, and there i met richard - an "angel" (that''s
    what they call dancers who come to help beginners). i approached him. before the
    evening ended, he asked me for a date. richard turned out to be the love of my
    life! i''m no spring chicken (i''m 50 plus) and never expected to find love again,
    but did i ever! he''s a few years younger than i am, but who''s counting? we''re
    getting married next week, and i''ve never been happier. abby, please tell your

    after reading about how mrs. dow''s name was constantly mispronounced, i was reminded
    of my own situation. i came to canada from holland in 1954 as an adult. i had

    examples: 1. the words power mower; what would we get if mower were pronounced
    like power sounds? 2. when introduced, a person takes a bow; but a gift looks
    pretty when decorated with a bow. 3. we know: the wind does blow, you can go with
    the flow, or lay low. tired? just go slow. a baby will grow. when happy, you glow.
    someone conceited will crow. a car stuck in the snow needs a tow. a person who''s
    angry needs things to throw. another name for a movie is a show. there are many

    you have had several letters about what to say when you see a parent disciplining
    a young child in public. i''ll tell you what to say: nothing! last week, on a
    crowded cruise ship, my 8-year-old son began acting up in public. he''d been cranky
    all day because he wasn''t getting his way, and he''d already been given plenty
    of warnings. at one point, he deliberately walked away from the family. i followed
    him, gave him a quick swat on the butt and told him to stay with us. i was immediately
    confronted by a furious woman who screamed at me, "that''s no way to treat a child!"
    startled at the intrusion, i had all i could do to keep from telling her to mind
    her own business. that woman had interrupted a private family matter. should i
    have thanked her for her concern and explained that the boy was taking medication
    for a hyperactive disorder - that he had been abandoned by his birth mother, been
    physically abused in two foster homes and ultimately labeled "hard to place" -
    a euphemism for "unadoptable"? should i have explained that he was classified
    as severely emotionally disturbed? abby, while preparing to adopt this child,
    i spent months doing research, seeking advice and support about the best ways
    to meet his special needs, so he could have the best chance of becoming a fully
    independent adult. it isn''t easy. he throws tantrums, gets frustrated, argumentative
    and stubborn. other times he''s bright, charming, affectionate and playful. we''ve
    had some terrific times together, and i can''t imagine life without him. i love
    this boy. yes, it''s disheartening to see a parent yelling at a child in public,

    questioned by another adult. please sign me... a lucky father'

    my family recently suffered a tragic loss. my husband''s young brother, andre,
    was murdered on the streets of manhattan for nothing more than his wallet and
    his watch. the murderer has not yet been apprehended. we understand from the police
    that there were 12 murders in that area over a short period of time. has this
    lead to an increase in the number of police officers patrolling this area? no!
    have any of these murders, including my brother-in-law''s, been publicized? no!
    last month, a colleague at work lost his brother in a random mugging in an affluent
    neighborhood of long island. nowadays, it seems wherever you turn, somebody has
    lost a loved one through violence. as a society, we must not become desensitized
    to these murders. we must not sweep them under the rug like they never happened,
    because if we do, we will lose all respect for life. it is a sad commentary on
    our society that rapes are not even reported in the newspaper unless one of the
    parties is a celebrity. every violent crime should be publicized. society should

    your advice to "glad i did in st. paul" to take a few weekend trips together to
    test "compatibility" before marriage is unbelievably naive and shortsighted. can
    a few days together, pretending to be married, really tell two people whether
    their marriage will last? perhaps the couple would be better off spending many
    months talking about what really makes a marriage work, like commitment, deep
    love, spiritual oneness, honesty, and a willingness to give more than to take.
    living together is simply another excuse to avoid the hard work it takes to love
    someone unconditionally. a recent study covering 23 years, by axinn and thornton
    of the university of chicago and the university of michigan, shows "the possibility
    that cohabitation weakens a commitment to marriage as an institution," and "produces
    attitudes and values which increase the probability of divorce." counselor, champaign,

    how often do we see photographs of automobile accidents with the words, "the cause
    of the wreck is unknown"? if you think about it, when automobiles pass you, particularly
    on freeways or high-speed roads, a major portion of these passers will cut in
    front of you so sharply that you automatically react by either braking, turning
    your wheels or swerving. these drivers are either thoughtless or ignorant of the
    proper way to pass another vehicle. how many have unknowingly caused the death
    of an innocent person because they cut in too quickly and breezed merrily on down
    the road? years ago, i was guilty of cutting in too quickly. a friend who was
    behind me stopped me and told me that the right way to pass and cut back into
    line was to watch my rearview mirror, and when i could see both of the headlights
    of the car i was passing, i would be about 300 feet ahead - and it was safe to
    cut back into the right lane. try this and you will agree with me. i hope this
    will be published and possibly a few lives will be spared. (i''ve been driving

    this is a message to those who try to prevent women from entering abortion clinics

    child? if not, why not? is it because you don''t want one, can''t afford one,
    or don''t have the time, patience or desire to raise a child? what if a woman
    about to enter a family planning clinic saw your sign and decided not to have
    an abortion, but chose instead to give her baby to you? would you accept it? what
    if the mother belonged to a minority group - or was addicted to drugs, or tested
    positive for aids? why are you spending your time carrying a sign? why aren''t
    you volunteering to baby-sit so a single mother can work? why haven''t you opened
    your door to a pregnant teenager whose parents have kicked her out when she took
    your advice and decided not to have an abortion? as for taxpayers who resent paying
    for abortions, who do you think pays for foster care, welfare, social workers
    and juvenile delinquency? taxpayers. how about something money can''t buy: love.
    have you ever visited a home for abused and unwanted children? have you ever been
    to juvenile hall and seen the children who have committed crimes because they
    were born to mothers who didn''t want them? i''m not thrilled about abortion,
    but i don''t think anyone has the right to tell others not to have one unless
    he or she has done the things i have mentioned above. so, to those carrying signs
    and trying to prevent women from entering family planning clinics, heed my message:
    if you must be against abortion, don''t be a hypocrite - make your time and energy

    this is a doozy! i''ve recently started a fish aquarium, and with the new fish
    i purchased (at a store in my hometown), along came some disappointing news. although

    that have been injected with dye to colorize their bodies. abby, i wasn''t aware

    this man highly, and stress "one time." do these people think they''re god''s

    from one week to approximately 18 months - very disappointing. abby, the owner
    told me i should''ve asked first! i am a new fish owner, and i certainly was not
    aware of this practice. wouldn''t it be better for their business (not to mention
    their reputation) to simply put up a sign that reads: "some of the fish have been

    i accidentally sold something that belonged to my husband at our garage sale.

    notice was in the newspaper, including the time and place of the service. because

    "private service," i went to show my respect for the family. i''m distressed that

    i''m a 30-year-old female sailor in the u.s. navy, stationed in europe. i recently
    became acquainted with a 16-year-old american girl who told me there was this
    really cute guy she had the "hots" for. this "cute guy" is a 21-year-old sailor
    who, in my opinion, is going on 16 himself. i had several heart-to-heart talks
    with her, explaining that sex was something precious and should be saved for marriage.
    well, she didn''t take my advice, and a month later she joyfully told me that
    she had been to bed with him. i asked her if this guy was protecting her. she
    answered, "oh, i''m taking birth control pills!" i explained that that was not
    the question - was the fellow responsible enough to protect her from sexually
    transmitted diseases by using a condom? she then told me he had said condoms were
    only for one-night stands! abby, i just about passed out! we, in the military,
    were given a series of lectures about the dangers of unprotected sex. i tried
    my best to educate this girl. two months later she said she thought she might
    be pregnant. of course, she was. i urged her to consider adoption, but she wants
    to keep the baby. her immaturity is scary - she thinks it will be really "neat"
    to have a baby; her school friends do, too. all i can do is pray for her and the
    unborn baby. because of an irresponsible young man and a teenager with the "hots"
    for a cute sailor, a child was conceived. this is neither "neat" nor wonderful.
    it''s a tragedy that''s robbed a young girl of her childhood. please don''t use
    my name, rank or station. it would be apparent to persons here who know her, and
    i don''t want to hurt her family any more than they already are. sign me . . .

    regarding the sign a reader had posted on her front door stating "no soliciting,

    situation? last week, a pleasant young woman was going from door to door collecting
    money to "save the whales," the earth, or whatever. after telling her several
    times he was not interested, he finally said, "why don''t you give me your home
    phone number, and i''ll get back to you if i change my mind?" her face dropped,
    and she became indignant, saying, "why, that is impossible!" when my husband asked,
    "why?" she replied, "because i don''t want to be bothered at my home!" my husband
    said, "well, you''re bothering me at my home; what''s the difference?" the young
    woman turned and left. this may not keep solicitors from coming to your door,
    but it sure gives the homeowner a little satisfaction to have a ready response
    to solicitors. avid reader, marblehead, mass.'

    quiet her. now we will have to crop the part of the video showing monica lying
    on top of the church altar, facing the camera with her dress up, and her panties
    showing. after the ceremony, monica''s parents took her to the reception and let
    her run loose. thank god they took her home early. some guests asked me why i
    didn''t stop the ceremony and ask monica''s parents to take her home so others

    this is a second marriage for both of us. i was a 47-year-old widow, and my new

    50. we''ve been married for a year, but there is one problem. when we eat out

    her in a flirty manner, then stares at her behind when she walks away. (he is
    not even subtle about it.) when i tell him to quit leering, he insists there''s
    nothing wrong with "looking." he says, "that''s why women wear tight pants and

    i was a waitress, and i turned a few heads myself, but even though i had a beautiful

    i totally disagree with your statement, "if an engagement is broken by either
    party, the lady should return the ring, or she''s no lady." i went with "al" for
    nine years. in our eighth year, we announced our engagement with plans to marry
    a year later. my engagement ring was gorgeous-four carats. i quit a successful
    career to start a business with al. well, umpteen wedding showers later, and only
    nine days before the wedding, with 600 invited guests, al called the wedding off.
    i was crushed and humiliated. he claimed his feelings for me had changed due to
    flashbacks of "child abuse." (i later learned that he had been having an affair
    with my best friend.) my poor parents had spent thousands of dollars, and i had
    foolishly taken money out of my iras and savings to make ours the perfect wedding.
    i did not return the ring, and he gave me no argument. am i less of a lady for
    having kept it? i felt entitled to it. i will never forget the pain and humiliation,
    but fortunately, the scars have healed. this does have a happy ending. i am now
    happily married to a wonderful man, and i thank god daily for small miracles.
    sign me . . . a lady who kept the ring'

    i am a widow who has been seeing a very special gentleman for the last five months.
    he has taken me out to dinner and shows, and we enjoy each other''s company very
    much. he is a widower about my age. i have invited him to my home for dinners
    quite often, and he has contributed dinners by bringing them to my home, which
    was wonderful. we both hate eating alone. after dinner (at my home), he said he
    had something important to say to me. i thought he was about to propose marriage,
    but it wasn''t that at all. to make a long story short, he took a check out of
    his wallet and handed it to me. it was for $200. i asked, "what is this for?"
    he replied, "well, you have had me to your home for dinners so often, i just wanted
    to give you a little gift." i explained that i had invited him to dinner because
    i enjoyed his company, and with that, i tore up his check. is what i did so terrible?

    i can''t get your "proud smokers" column off my mind. my father-in-law also used
    to say, "i know that smoking isn''t good for me, but i''d rather enjoy my time
    on earth and die a little earlier than deprive myself of the things i enjoy."
    i was in medical school at the time. unfortunately, dad didn''t get very much
    more enjoyment because he had to have bypass surgery. then he needed his arteries
    stripped so his brain could get proper blood supply. then they stripped his femoral
    arteries, not once, but twice - all the while he continued to "enjoy himself"
    as he smoked one cigarette after another. soon his leg became gangrenous because
    there wasn''t enough artery to save, so they amputated his leg almost to his hip.
    by that time, i was a resident in pathology, and dad''s other leg began to lose
    circulation, and his bypasses were clogging. had enough? well, so did he. fortunately,
    he died before they did any further amputations. through all of this, dad never
    deprived himself of the pleasure of smoking, but he deprived his family of having
    him around to celebrate his 60th birthday. you may use my name. lisa k. helfend,

    i just read the letter from "al" - the smoker who says, "everybody has to die
    of something," so he''s going to keep right on smoking. al sounds like my husband,
    joe - with one big difference - al is alive. lung cancer killed joe three weeks
    ago. al, if you are like my joe, you probably believe if you get lung cancer,
    modern science will come to your rescue. wrong! only 8 percent of people diagnosed
    with lung cancer live for a year afterward. why? because by the time you can see
    it on your chest x-ray, it''s already too late. my joe was 56 - four years younger
    than al. he had no unusual symptoms. we thought he had a cold, maybe pneumonia.
    joe''s parents both lived to their late 70s, so rule out heredity. i''m not one
    of the "never-smoked" crowd who doesn''t understand how difficult it is to quit.
    (i smoked for 20 years before i quit, and now i''m scared spitless that i didn''t
    quit soon enough.) one more time, al. smoking kills . . . and it will make you
    wish you were dead long before it finishes the job. sign me . . . linda, joe''s

    men attending a funeral, and they were laughing so hard, their shoulders were
    shaking. tears were running down my son''s cheeks, so i handed him my handkerchief.
    it was pale pink with butterflies embroidered on it, and when his cousin saw it,
    he got hysterical all over again. i finally tapped my son on the shoulder and
    motioned for him to leave and take his cousin with him. (later someone mentioned
    to me that my son took my cousin''s death very hard. i didn''t say anything.)
    after the service, i apologized to the minister. he said, "i''ve seen this happen
