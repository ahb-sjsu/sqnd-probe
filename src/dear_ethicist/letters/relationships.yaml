    Dear Ethicist,

    My friend Sarah told me that our mutual friend Jake is cheating on his wife. Sarah swore me to secrecy. But Jake's wife Emily is also my friend.

    Am I obligated to keep Sarah's secret? Does Emily have a right to know what I know? I feel terrible either way.

    Dear Ethicist,

    I agreed to be my friend's maid of honor six months ago. Since then, we've had a falling out over something unrelated. The wedding is in two months.

    Can I back out now? Or am I locked into this commitment despite our changed relationship?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My neighbor's dog barks from 11pm to 6am almost every night. I've mentioned it politely twice and they said they're "working on it." It's been three months.

    Do they have an obligation to control their pet? Do I have a right to quiet enjoyment of my home?

    Dear Ethicist,

    The fence between my property and my neighbor's is falling apart. They want to replace it with something nicer but expect me to pay half. I think the current fence is fine.

    Am I obligated to split the cost? Do they have the right to demand my contribution?

    Dear Ethicist,

    I saw my best friend's husband on what was clearly a date with another woman. My friend seems blissfully unaware.

    Am I obligated to tell them? Do they have a right to expect me to share what I saw?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My ex left some boxes at my place when we broke up two years ago. I've asked multiple times if they want them. Now they suddenly demand I return everything immediately.

    After two years of ignoring my offers, do they still have a claim to this stuff? Am I obligated to accommodate their timeline?

    Dear Ethicist,

    My roommate and I have an informal deal: whoever gets home first orders dinner. Last Tuesday, I got home first but crashed on the couch after a brutal day. My roommate was annoyed.

    Do I actually owe her an apology? We never signed anything. Does our informal arrangement create a real obligation?
